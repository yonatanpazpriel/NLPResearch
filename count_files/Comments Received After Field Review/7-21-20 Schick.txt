Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Must Include Arab American Studies 

Dear Instructional Quality Commission members, Superintend Thurmond, and State Board of 
Education President Darling-Hammonds, 

I am a 30-year veteran Jewish public school educator who strongly supports the inclusion of 
Arab American Studies as an integral part of the California Model Ethnic Studies curriculum. 

As an educator I witnessed and have been told about the harassment of Palestinian American and 
Muslim students since 9/11 that denied these students the right to a safe learning 
environment.  One student told me about other students whispering behind him:  “Is D. a 
terrorist?”  He said to me, “I went to kindergarten with these students.” 

The TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) found 
that 66% of our students received most of their information about Arab peoples and Muslims 
from the internet and television.  As educators we want our students to be critical thinkers, to 
learn how to assess valid and invalid information, and to synthesize the information into new 
ideas.  This is an excellent argument for the inclusion of Arab American Studies. 

Arab American Studies must be part of the rubric for Asian American Studies since much of the 
Arab world is in Asia.  The history and struggle of Palestine is also part of this rubric. 

I urge you to collaborate with Arab American scholars to ensure that our students, as the future 
leaders in our country, receive accurate, valid and empowering lessons that include Arab 
Americans. 

Sincerely yours, 
Carla S. Schick
