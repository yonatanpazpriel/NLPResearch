ras TAN SP

Califomia. school as my parents Cwho
immigrated here from Israel 10 years ago)
always told. me how inclusive and loving
the Califomia. school system is. But |
understand this isn't tue anymore. With a.
good. intention of adding "ethnic studies*
that are supposed to promote equality and
understanding, you were duped by the
people who created the program to actually
against my ethic group. Can you please
stop that from. happening?
