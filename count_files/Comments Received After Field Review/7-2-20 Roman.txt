Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American Studies 

Hello. 
I am writing to say that I am a STRONG SUPPORTER of Arab American Studies in the schools. I am a grandmother 
whose grandson will be attending school starting next year, and my two sons also attended public schools in San 
Francisco. I am a retired Registered Nurse, and a homeowner and I vote and try to participate in our community 
governance.  

Ethnic studies (ESMC) are some of the most important classes that can be offered in the U.S. The U.S. has one of 
the most diverse populations, and it is more important now than ever to teach all of us about each other, to 
counterbalance the traditional  normalizing and promoting of perspectives historically offered and which are 
skewed by a White Supremacist viewpoint.  

In this polarized world full of disinformation about the Arab World, and Islamophobia, it is more important than 
ever that students get real information. The United States is deteriorating into a free for all of white supremacists 
terrorizing people of color. We must do all we can to stop this violence and hate, and ethnic studies and learning 
about each other is one of the best ways.  

THERE IS NOTHING ANTISEMITIC ABOUT HAVING INFORMATION ABOUT THE HISTORY AND PRACTICE IN ISRAEL, 
AND THE PLIGHT OF THE PALESTINIAN PEOPLE. I am Jewish and I unequivocally state my support for Arab 
American Studies to be taught and to include this very real history of the Middle East.  

If there are any changes to be made to any curriculum, it is imperative that Arab American scholars and Ethnic 
Studies teachers be included and consensus reached.  

Thank you very much. 

Sincerely, 
Nora Roman, RN
