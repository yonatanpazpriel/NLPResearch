Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

Hello, 

My name is Vanessa Tran. I am a lifelong resident of California, and a recent graduate of UC 
Berkeley's Ethnic Studies program. I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies.  

Arab American studies is crucial to helping California students better understand topics like 
Islamophobia and Orientalism, and is another lens to learn more about the widespread 
xenophobia in the U.S. With so much happening in the world, specifically in this post-9/11 
period, it is imperative for California students to deeply engage with these topics, and to build a 
better world for us all to live in.  

The history of Palestine is also another important topic that is often left out of curriculums due 
to Zionists. Contrary to what Zionists insist, advocating for Palestine to be free is not anti-
semitic. Israel is a settler-colony, like the U.S., despite Israeli claims to indigeneity. Teaching 
students about Palestine will further students' knowledge by connecting current fights for 
freedom with prior social movements, and will also provide a case study for what solidarity 
looks like (Black-Palestinian solidarity).  

Thank you for your time. 
Vanessa
