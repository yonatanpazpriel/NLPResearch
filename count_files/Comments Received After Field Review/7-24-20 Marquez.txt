Hello,  
I am a college student and I support the ESMC including the Arab American Studies. I have 
taken, and am currently taking, a few ethnic studies classes and they have educated me on 
people's histories around the world that I did not previously know. I believe that right now 
many people are divided and dividing themselves based on assumptions made due to 
ignorance, these assumptions could lead to xenophobia and could attack a specific group, like 
Islamophobia. Telling the stories and experiences of West Asian Americans could teach people 
about the Islamophobia and xenophobia that occurs to this day. These ethnic studies classes 
educate students and could correct the assumptions that were once made. I also believe that 
the history of Palestine should be included in these programs. Finally, I strongly encourage Arab 
American scholars and Ethic Studies practitioners to join forces with Arab American students 
for the students to have their voices heard and introduce new ideas.  

Thank you for your time. 
Melissa Marquez
