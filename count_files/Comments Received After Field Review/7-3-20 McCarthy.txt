Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC and Arab American Studies 

To whom it may concern: 

I am writing this email to strongly condemn any effort to remove Arab American studies from 
the Asian American section of the California Ethnic Studies curriculum. California's students 
deserve to better understand the history and culture of Arab Americans, especially during a time 
where Islamaphobia is still widely present in our society and ignorance around Arab Americans 
abounds. Countering media stereotypes and providing a curriculum that reflects the history and 
current reality of Arab American students should be part of any California Ethnic Studies 
curriculum. 

As a secondary school teacher for the past 25 years, and having traveled widely in the Middle 
East, I believe it would be an egregious omission to delete curricular matter in response to 
pressure from nationalist or Zionist interests.    

Thank you.
