Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American Studies 

As an SF State Professor emerita from the Department of Modern Languages, I understand 
clearly the importance of Arab American studies. We had many students petitioning for this to 
be part of our curriculum, particularly in the wake of 2001, when discrimination against Arabs 
increased in the Bay Area. It is vital that students understand this part of the world, and know 
that it is not anti-Semitic or anti-Jewish or anti-Israel to understand what is going on in the Arab 
world.  

Our students need to be prepared to be full citizens of California, the United States and the 
world community, and education about Arab Americans is a vital part of that. I urge you to 
include Arab American studies in the curriculum. 

Sincerely, 

Elizabeth Wright
