Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Arab American studies must be included as part of Asian American studies.  White 
nationalism, Islamophobia and xenophobia is on the rise, and it is more important 
than ever to teach students about diversity, tolerance and about the experience of 
Americans from the Levant  and West Asia. Palestinian history and the Palestinian 
struggle for human rights is a crical component of this history, and while some 
may wish to suppress such discourse and call it anti-semitic, such is not the case -- 
it is a struggle for freedom by a people who have been under Israeli occupation 
since 1948. Palestinian existence is not  antisemitic. Students need to know that the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights applies to all people -- there are no 
exceptions!  The views of Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners 
should be heard and collaborated with as you revise CA school curricula.
