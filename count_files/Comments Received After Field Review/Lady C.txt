Subject: Core curriculum 

I for one will be praying for the children of California that they are not brainwashed into 
California's forced core curriculum and evil agenda that is being pushed. Another Holocaust??

Put GOD back in the schools!  
In the name of the God the Father, God the Son, Jesus and God the Holy Spirit
