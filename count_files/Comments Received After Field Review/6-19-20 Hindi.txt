By statute, AB 2016 authorized the State Board of Education to adopt a Model Curriculum for Ethnic Studies 
by March 31, 2020.  Current controversy to remove Arab American Studies from the Model Curriculum or to 
continue to delay implementation of ESMC, as opponents of Ethnic Studies argue, are unacceptable. I 
unequivocally condemn Islamophobia, racism and xenophobia. Moreover, I  urge support for the prompt 
realization of the promise of AB 2016, to redouble on the original intent of this curriculum to uplift equity, 
inclusiveness, and universally high expectations for education.  

San Mateo-Foster City School District (SMFCSD) has long advocated for equity, and I am proud to see 
your district consider this tonight. Ethnic Studies courses offer profound academic and social value to students  
of all races and ethnicities. On matters of race and ethnicity, please act boldly and join me in championing 
educational justice. Please vote unanimously to adopt this resolution tonight.  

Sincerely, 

Sam Hindi 
City of Foster City 
Councilmember
