Glossary – includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) 
Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to “establish freedom 
for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions.” It then parrots more BDS 
talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, 
which seeks to end Israel’s existence.  
Page 234 – Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called 
Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. In 2016, 
both houses of the California legislature overwhelmingly passed the Combating 
BDS Act, which Governor Brown signed into law. In light of this, how could this 
curriculum recognize BDS as legitimate, let alone promote it? 
Page 234 – Promotes a false equivalence between Israel’s efforts to stop 
terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. 
policies on the border with Mexico. 
Page 237 – Uses unclear language that implies “Israel-Palestine” as a whole is 
an Arab country. 
Page 242 – Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no 
alternative perspectives.

Page 256, 264-269 – Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh 
criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or 
criticism of Palestinian leaders.  
Introduction – States that “The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an 
opportunity for teachers to…enable students to develop a deep appreciation for 
cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and 
racism.” Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson 
about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With 
antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem 
in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.  
As a career educator, I am deeply disturbed by the model curriculum currently 
being reviewed by The State of California, which openly promotes hateful 
boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am appalled 
that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized 
communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and 
frequent target of racism. As a parent and a California resident, I would hope to 
see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, 
which promotes hate and division. While I cannot comment from firsthand 
knowledge about depictions of other ethnic groups or conflicts, the very one-
sided and biased portrayal of the situation in the Middle East with which I am 
intimately familiar casts a doubt in my mind about the entire curriculum.
