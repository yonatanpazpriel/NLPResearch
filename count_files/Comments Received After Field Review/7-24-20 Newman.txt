Subject: [EXTERNAL] ethnics school curriculum issue 

good morning Soomin 
I am a registered CA voter-was on the initial 12 member Hillsborough Schools Foundation Board 
and co managed their endowment fund for 10 years 
I am writing to you to please vote NO against the  

California school board consideration of adopting a curriculum that has been accused of 

promoting anti-Semitic and radical anti-Israel content, despite the Jewish communityâ€™s vocal 

objections. 

I beg you to work with your associates to ensure this egregious proposal is not adopted 
The level of anti semitism, anti Israel rhetoric has never been higher post the Holocaust, whom 
a number of those on the committee are Holocaust deniers 
Please prevent this from happening 
Jerry
