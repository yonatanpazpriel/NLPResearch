Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies – don’t shut out Arab-American experience 

Dear Instructional Quality Commission Shanine Coats, 

Please don't go along with the general trend in this country of vilifying Arab. About one 
third of the WORLD is Muslim. Most Arabs are Muslim. If we're going to start getting 
along better with the Muslim world we should learn more about them, not pretend they 
don't exist. 
Before the inquisition (mid 1400's) Christians, Jews and Muslims live in harmony. In 
Spain at least. It was a fabulous culture of shared science, mathematics and art. 
Religious extremists (Christians that time) destroyed that culture and we're STILL 
paying for it! 

Sincerely, 
LaVive Kiely
