Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

Hi my name is Paris and I am writing to you today to beg you to include Arab American Studies 
in your Ethnic Studies Curriculum. Since 9/11 and since the United States has started 
intervening and starting endless wars in Southwest Asia and Northern Africa, the American 
Publix has only had a vague understanding of Arab people, usually in the form of racist 
stereotypes. Including Arab American studies can help your students comprehend Arab 
American history and people in a fuller, less islamaphonic and xenophobic way. I insist that the 
history and struggles of Palestine be included as well as this nations history and oppression are 
often overlooked or unknown in American culture. I am also demanding that any revisions 
made to the Arab American Studies curriculum and existence be made in collaboration with 
Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies Practitioners. When you have a n area of study 
called Asian Studies, it would be wrong not to include all parts of Asia, so please take account of 
West and Southwest Asia and act with respect toward these peopleâ€™s and nations.  
Thanks you, Paris
