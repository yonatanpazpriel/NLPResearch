Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Middle Eastern Studies 

Hello, my name is Tara and I am a student supporting the ESMC, including Arab 
American Studies.  
As a Middle Eastern woman, I know the impact of having our history erased 
from curriculum, devastating not only for us, but others who loose an 
incredible learning opportunity. West Asian American experiences are crucial 
in overcoming racism, xenophobia, and Islamophobia which are so rampant 
today. This also includes extensive information and education on Palestine. It is 
therefore crucial that any change implemented to Arab American and Middle 
Eastern studies be done in collaboration with the communities and students 
impacted. 
Thank you.
