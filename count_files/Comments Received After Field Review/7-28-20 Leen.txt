1. I am a student 
2. I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies 
3. Being an Arab youth in America means actively trying to combat the stereotypes that are 
pushed forward by the media through smiling at complete strangers, even when I am not 
feeling happy, so they can "feel comfortable" around me, a Muslim woman wearing the hijab. I 
have to forge my authentic identity in my peers' memories so they don't associate me and my 
people with the dehumanizing stereotypes they see in the media. This program will provide 
both my teachers and my peers a richer understanding of my identity as an Arab woman in 
America, my culture, heritage, and my legitimate history.
