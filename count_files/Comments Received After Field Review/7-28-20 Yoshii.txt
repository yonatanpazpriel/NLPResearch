Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I write to support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the Asian American studies 
curriculum currently under your evaluation. As an Asian American who benefited from the first 
Asian American studies classes in 1970 at the University of California, I can testify to how 
important ethnic studies is for one's sense of identity, self worth, and empowerment. In the 
current climate we are experiencing, anti-Asian sentiment surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic 
makes our community vulnerable, but thanks to ethnic studies and social empowerment for the 
Asian American community there are tools to educate and advocate against this social 
discrimination and others forms of racism when they raise their ugly head.  

I am equally concerned for the Arab American community that has continually been subjected 
to demonization and exclusion in mainstream public education and media. As a Japanese 
American I became acutely aware of how responses to 9/11 included intentional smearing, 
demonization, and infiltration of Arab American communities much like what led to the mass 
incarceration of Japanese Americans in World War II. As a Christian pastor I have also become 
educated on the depth to which our faith is often weaponized as a tool against Arab Americans, 
particularly those of the Muslim tradition.  

Inclusion of Arab American studies is a critical step towards providing a framework and 
resources for the public education of all of our students, as well as the building of positive self-
esteem for Arab American youth. For these reasons, I urge you to include Arab American 
studies as part of the framework for the proposed Ethnic Studies program.  

Sincerely, 
Michael Yoshii Yoshii
