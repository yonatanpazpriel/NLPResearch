Dear  Ms. Soomin Chao 

As Chair of the California Instructional Quality Commission, I implore you to see that the 

Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is not used in any California school until it has 

undergone the revisions that have been recommended by a broad group of independent 

educators. 

In its current form, the proposed curriculum places undue emphasis on Arab American 

culture and individuals while promoting anti-Semitism, and criticizing Israel. A public 

school curriculum should build understanding and tolerance. By using the Arab 

American Studies Course Outline in developing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Draft the result will be reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 

criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public 

schools the result will be increased hate and prejudice.
