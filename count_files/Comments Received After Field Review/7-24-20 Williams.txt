Subject: [EXTERNAL] Adoption of antisemetic Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

To Whom it May Concern, 

The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted is very much against the American value of 
inclusion for all. Why does the Draft find it necessary to erase the American Jewish experience, fail to discuss 
antisemitism, and reinforce negative sterotypes of the Jewish people? Is this the Islamic idea of fairness? I believe 
singling out Israel for criticism shows a terrible basis & will instill our students with prejudice and hate.
