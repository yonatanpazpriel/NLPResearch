Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic studies curriculum 

As a middle school teacher, and first generation college graduate in my family, I have seen 
the powerful and empowering impacts of ethnic studies. It is imperative that we include 
Arab histories and current realities in what we teach our youth in order to foster resilience, 
understanding, and social justice.    

Please include Arab American Studies in the CA Ethnic Studies curriculum. The ESMC is 
structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: 
American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American 
studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab 
American studies within Asian American studies.
