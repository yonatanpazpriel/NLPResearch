Chair, Instructional Quality Commission
California Department of Education
1430 N Street

Sacramento, CA 95814

Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:

| respectfully join my colleagues from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus in expressing
deep concerns with the recent draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and call for
the development of a model curriculum that accurately reflects the significant contributions of
American Jews to California’s history, politics, and culture, and is free of bias and negative
stereotypes.

| want to express my appreciation and support for the work being done to ensure our high
school students learn and understand California’s complicated history grounded in the
perspectives and experiences of people of color. | know that our students stand to benefit
greatly from this discipline, which can help improve school climate and understanding of the
diverse cultures of our state. The fact that California will have an Ethnic Studies Model
Curriculum is a landmark moment for our K-12 education system. It is for this reason that we
must be conscious of how different communities are affected by structures of power and
racism, including the Jewish community.

| believe my colleagues’ call for a curriculum that addresses antisemitism and the Jewish
community’s longstanding struggle against hatred, bigotry, and discrimination is merited. |
support my colleagues’ request for a curriculum that better reflects the American Jewish
experience, especially in light of the recent and continued attacks on and discrimination of the
Jewish community across the nation.

| understand that the deadline for public comment has closed but | appreciate your
consideration of my support for a curriculum that addresses the concerns of the Jewish Caucus.

Sincerely,

nna M. Caballero
