I am incredibly concerned about the CA Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum of Education. It does not mention the 
American Jewish experience, does not discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles 
out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. I am 
also concerned about the curriculum’s inclusion of the divisive BDS movement, which is inconsistent with the Ethnic 
Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines to ‘create space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, 
sexuality or citizenship, to learn different perspectives. It is completely one-sided regarding the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict and does not even mention that Jewish people immigrated to Israel because they were fleeing the holocaust 
or because they were kicked out of their Arab homelands for being Jewish. I grew up in the California public schools 
and experience antisemitism firsthand at school. I am worried that it will be even worse for my children if this 
curriculum is implemented.
