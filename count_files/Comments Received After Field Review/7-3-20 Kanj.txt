Subject: [EXTERNAL] IQC, INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

I support including Arab American studies within the rubric of Asian American 
studies. 

In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American 
students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and 
current realities. It is critical for my children's friends to better understand the 
culture and history of their friends.
