The proposed ethnic studies curriculum will inflame instead of 
promoting understanding.  The proposed language is too complicated 
for many students and it is quiet slanted.  It will not serve its stated 
purpose -  just provide a vehicle for some angry people to express 
themselves.  The students will be the losers.    It must undergo major 
change and include additional groups.
