Dear Mr Thurmond, 

I am so excited to hear about the effort you are putting in to create meaningful, relevant Ethnic 
Studies Curriculum for California schools.  

I am a clinical psychologist with a PhD in bullying prevention and I have found that the best 
approach in reaching youth about these types of sensitive issues is through video-based peer 
learning.  
If they can see stories of other students that they identify with expressing difficulties they relate 
to, this learning becomes immediately relevant and breaks down barriers of race, class, and 
culture.  
This way, meaningful conversation can be generated in the classroom that goes beyond merely 
stating facts that can be misinterpreted or misconstrued. 

I have been creating documentary stories of teens sharing their experiences of mental health 
struggles, and many of the stories (to be released) centre around prejudice, bullying, and 
harassment.  
Here is a link to the Mental Health Curriculum Overview Video that explains how I have been 
using these stories in schools across the US, Canada, and Australia (and soon in Swaziland, 
South Africa, and the UK as well).  

I would love a chance to discuss how this video-based story-telling methodology could be used 
to explore ethnic studies in California schools. 

Thank you so much for your time!
