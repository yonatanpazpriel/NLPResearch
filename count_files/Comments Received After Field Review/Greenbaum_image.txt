RE: Ethnic Studies Curriculum

Dear instructional Quality Commission,

My name is Debbie Greenbaum. | am a credentiated teacher and Califorriia citizen, and tam deeply
concerned about the California Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, This
l√©tter is to confirm that | added my signature to the Israel-American Community's official complaint,
and have submitted this complaint on my behalf.

The proposed coursework, as written, will turn California classrooms into discriminatory and hostile
environments for the young people in our community. This curriculum. endorses prejudice against
Jewish, Israeli-American and Zionist students, and delegitimizes their heritage: and identity. It will lead
to harassment, bullying, and discrimination,

This deeply biased curriculum has no place in our public schools, which should.be forums for teaching
respectful dialogue, understanding, and tolerance.

lask that you respectfully consider putting a hold on the currently proposed curriculum, and: meet our
community leaders to discuss how to improve this deeply biased coursework, which would create a
hostile environment for lsraeli-American and Jewish-American students.
