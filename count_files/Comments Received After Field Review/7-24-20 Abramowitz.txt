Subject: [EXTERNAL] Hate teaching is wrong 

Dear Chair person:  
Teaching hate for any religious group is wrong! Learning is good and should be non biased especially in a public 
institution like California schools. Please reject anti Israel curriculum or any other anti Semitic or anti other 
religions curriculum.  
Thank you.
