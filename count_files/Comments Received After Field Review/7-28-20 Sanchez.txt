Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

In order to overcome generalizations pushed by "Orientalism" that creates a narrative of "us 
versus them", Arab-American Studies must be included in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. 
Eliminating these courses would not allow students to take a holistic and humanistic approach 
in their learning. 

Sincerely, 
Kimberly Sanchez
