Subject: [EXTERNAL] Vote YES on Students First! From a concerned resident 

Dear Ms. London,  

I urge you to put “Students First” by supporting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum led by 
scholars of color from across California.  Oakland is exactly the kind of city that should stand up 
for our underrepresented communities. 

Ethnic Studies has always been about empowering students of color who are marginalized and 
minimized by our curriculum.  We need to bring this conversation back to the focus of Students 
First, one of our Core OUSD Values.  Our white students greatly benefit from having these 
critical conversations about race, so that all Oaklanders can build skills to navigate our society 
and build stronger communities and neighborhoods. 

Ethnic Studies is important to me because these curriculums have been developed through 
histories of scholarship that center resistance to the oppressive structures we see in our world 
today. We should be equipping students with the power of histories that center of the 
marginalized as their stories have repeatedly been wiped out of consciousness. As someone on 
the Board of Education, you have a duty to make sure you are putting in all the effort you can to 
represent the underrepresented, especially in the education systems of Oakland.  

This controversy is a perfect example of why we must have these conversations to address 
racial tensions in our community, so that we can move toward healing, understanding, and 
solidarity across all of our cultures. 

Please vote YES, thank you!
