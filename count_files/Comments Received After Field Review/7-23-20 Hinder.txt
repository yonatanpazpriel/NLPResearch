Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curricula Now 

Esteemed Board Member: 

I am writing to demand the implementation of Black experiences, voices, and history in K-12 curriculum. 

Subjecting students to a Eurocentric curriculum throughout their most formative years contributes 
significantly to the perpetuation of systemic racism within schools. This then contributes significantly to 
the degradation of Black people beyond the classroom. 

Please read the full letter of demands here: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-

These demands are not new. They are an amplification of the calls to action of activists, students, and 
educators who have asked your school district to immediately implement racially inclusive, anti-racist 
Ethnic Studies. 

The time is long overdue to make change. White supremacy in public education must end now. There is 
no room for negotiation and placation. The time is now to tear down racism and demonstrate your 
commitment to ending systemic racism perpetuated by the use of Eurocentric curriculum. 

Regards, 

A concerned citizen
