PEACE POETRY 

Religions are based on scripture, which is mostly poetry. So it only makes sense that religious 
conflict must be resolved through poetry, and not through politics, negotiation, or war. I 
propose that all religious conflicts be redefined poetically, so that they can be resolved without 
bloodshed, winners, or losers. So let's sharpen our words not our swords, send missives not 
missiles, and apply our minds to metaphor, simile, rhyme, meter, and prosody, but not 
pomposity, animosity, ferocity, atrocity, or monstrosity. 

Best regards, 
Hugh Mann
