Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American studies 

Dear IQC, 

I am a community college student & retired senior citizen who has studied at UCSB & has 
professional degrees from UCD. When I first went to college, as far as I know, ethnic studies did 
not exist. I support ESMC, including Arab American studies as part of Asian American studies. 
Especially with the current Islamaphobia/xenophobia (exacerbated after 9/11 & under the current 
US administration), we need to study human rights including those of Palestinians.  I am 
Unitarian Universalist & not anti-Semitic.  
Like any academic department, decisions should be made in collaboration with relevant scholars, 
especially UC. 

In peace with justice, 

Laurie V. Jones
