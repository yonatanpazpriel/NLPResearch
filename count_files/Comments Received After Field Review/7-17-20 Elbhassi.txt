Dear, madam, sir, 

greetings. 

I’m writing to you as an East Bay Arab American resident, to express concern regarding the ESMC.  
I believe that it is of paramount importance to include the Arab Ethnic studies under Asian American Studies (Arab 
Western Asia). 

Our communities suffered for too long the effects of racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia. Including Arab studies 
into ethnic studies programs can only humanize our people, show our diversity and complex histories, and further 
support our efforts to normalize our existence and the lives of our children for generations to come in this country. 
Racism can only be fueled by ignorance. Continuing to keep our communities invisible and obscure from the public 
eye and education systems will only help to feed racism and islamophobia.  

Furthermore, as a Palestinian American, the tragedy of the loss of a homeland by my ancestors, and the struggle of 
the Palestinian people for dignity, self determination and human rights, has become over the decades, part of world 
history and the human experience. It’s only right to allow youth in our schools to learn this history as well as one of 
the most important issues in world affairs, as seen and told by Arab and Palestinian people and scholars. A narrative, 
I’m sure you are aware is gravely missing from public discourse in our country. 

Thanks for your time and attention, 
Yours sincerely, 

Waeil Elbhassi
