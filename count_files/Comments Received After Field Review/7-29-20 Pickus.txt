Subject: [EXTERNAL] I support the ESMC draft including Arab American studies 

As a Jewish Californian and retired public school teacher, I strongly support the ESMC draft 
which includes Arab American Studies within Asian American Studies.  

Fifty years ago, I was an active participant in the struggle at UC Berkeley for ethnic studies. I 
believed then as now that embracing the history and contributions of people of color to our 
society makes us stronger and more united.  Arab American Studies should continue to be 
included in the curriculum as part of Asian American Studies.  I reject the notion that discussion 
of Palestine is in any way anti-semitic. 

Sincerely,
