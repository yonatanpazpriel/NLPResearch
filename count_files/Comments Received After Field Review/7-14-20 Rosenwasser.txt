Subject: [EXTERNAL] I Support Arab American Studies! 

To Whom it May Concern: 

I’ve lived in Oakland 28 years, I’m a synagogue member – and I’ve co-taught an AntiSemitism / 
AntiArabism class at City College of San Francisco for 12 years with a Palestinian colleague. 
Plus I’ve published an award-winning book, “Hope into Practice, Jewish women choosing justice 
despite our fears.” 

I am writing in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, including Arab American 
Studies. 

 I’m thankful the Nazi Holocaust is taught in our schools, especially given the rise of white 
nationalism and the corresponding rise of violent antiSemitism. 

It’s also vital for the Palestinian narrative to be taught – so that Arab American students can 
see their histories reflected. In my diverse classroom, it’s thrilling to watch students learn from 
hearing Jewish and Palestinian narratives. They thrive from inclusion. This is what true 
education, transformative education, is about. Please don’t deny them this opportunity. 

Thank you.
