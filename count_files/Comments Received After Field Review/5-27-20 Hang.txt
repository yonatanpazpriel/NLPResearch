Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Ethnic Studies at OUSD 

Hello Aimee, 

Thank you for supporting the ESMC resolution. I am Co-Director at AYPAL, and I stand 
in solidarity with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft as created by scholars of 
color from across the state. 

Your support means you agree that our students need more resources, curricula and 
support to better reflect our incredibly diverse student population in Oakland. Our Arab 
American, Pacific Islander and Central American student populations are significant and 
growing in OUSD, and they deserve to see themselves reflected in our classroom 
content.  Our staff and other students should also learn this history.  Our history 
textbooks are insufficient and continue to be far too Eurocentric, and sometimes 
offensive or minimizing to communities of color.  

Ethnic studies is important to the youth I serve because historically, we have been 
silenced and written out of textbooks and because ethnic studies is also American 
studies. It is important to see ourselves reflected in the spaces we learn, to be in 
community with and learn from one another.  

Please stand up to 50 years of attacks on Ethnic Studies, and stand with students and 
teachers by voting YES on the ESMC resolution on May 27th! 

Thank You, 
Rhummanee Hang
