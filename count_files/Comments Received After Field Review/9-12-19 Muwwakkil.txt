My concern with regards to the ethnic studies course is the fact that the African-American culture was 
the "only" culture not defined in the table of contents.  I also would like to see more information about 
the fact that culturally we were Kings and Queens when operating freely in our homeland of Africa.  I 
would also like to see more information about the various tribes and their positive contribution with 
regards to all of the inventions that African-Americans created once forced unto American soil as 
slaves that helped society function successfully today.
