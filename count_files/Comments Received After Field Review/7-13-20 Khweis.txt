Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include Arab American Studies in the CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Dear Instructional Quality Commission,  

My name is Juman Khweis, and I'm a graduate student at the University of San Francisco (USF). I 
am writing in support of keeping the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) intact, 
including the proposed Arab American studies curriculum. In this era of Islamophobia and 
xenophobia, itâ€™s also important to include West Asian American experiences in the ESMC. 

Additionally, the history and current struggles in Palestine should be included in the curriculum. 
As a Palestinian-American, I have noticed that many of my classmates and professors know 
nothing to very little about the Palestinian people, and if they do know anything at all, it is often 
based on stereotypes in the media.  

Lastly, I ask that any revisions that affect Arab American studies should be made in 
collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. As an Arab-
American and Muslim-American grad student, it has been disheartening, hurtful, and 
frustrating to have to read textbooks and listen to talks that include misinformation and 
stereotypes about Arabs, Muslims, and Islam. I would hate for K-12 students to have to 
experience this, too. 

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Best,
