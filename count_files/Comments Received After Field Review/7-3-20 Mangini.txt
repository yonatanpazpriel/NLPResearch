Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab studies in curriculum 

Hello, 
It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, 
the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as “vectors” of disease, and the national uprising in 
response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students  need 
Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, 
strengthening our movements for justice. 
In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump’s Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in 
need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.  
Sincerely, 
Robin Mangini
