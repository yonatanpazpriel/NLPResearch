Subject: [EXTERNAL] Letter in Support of Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Greetings JUHSD School Board, 

I’m writing this letter in support of resolution to support the draft on the Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum. As a teacher of Ethnic Studies at SSFUSD in recent years, I have 
seen the potential of ethnic studies to create engaged and passionate young people 
who are invested in addressing racism and inequity in their communities. As a state that 
prides itself in diversity, it is critical that we support a curriculum that is rooted in 
highlighting voices that have been historically disenfranchised and silenced. 
Understanding the contributions and the ways in which communities of color have 
survived is essential to cultivating a healthy self-esteem among students so that they 
may reach their full potential. This curriculum is not to be mistaken as a curriculum that 
reduces the cultures and experiences of people of color to merely foods, dances, and 
costumes. Nor is this curriculum to be mistaken as encouraging racial tensions or 
divisions. It, in fact, has done the opposite, as evidenced by the growing body of 
research on Ethnic Studies. This curriculum is guided by principles of social justice and 
is rooted in, but not limited to, historical and sociological analysis. It is about critical 
thinking, building solidarity across racial groups, and is in line with many of the 
principles of the Civil Rights Movement in the 60’s around equity and civic engagement. 

I urge the board to vote unanimously in favor of this resolution. Thank you.
