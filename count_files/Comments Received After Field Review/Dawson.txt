This does not belong in public schools. This encourages our children to take part in BDS 
movement. This is outrageous and extreme. 
California should educate children instead of advancing this radical agenda. Teach kids how to 
read and write and to think for themselves.  
You want to teach our children that capitalism is racist. Just because they want more government 
control and enrich themselves. Knock it off! 

Thank you
