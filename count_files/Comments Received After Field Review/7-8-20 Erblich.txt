Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Dear CA Department of Education Ethnic Studies Public Comment, 

I am writing regarding California's Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission's 
proposed ethnic studies model curriculum......... 

Are u serious???? Why would anyone think using this curriculum is ok, it is so clearly not. The 
one-sidedness perspective in and of itself against the State and Jewish identity is enough to 
make a valid point of why this curriculum should NEVER be taught in a public school setting or 
in any civilized society.  

There is sooooo much anti-semitism and hate of other races, religion and cultures, that one 
would think anyone in charge of imparting genuine knowledge and compassion for others 
would not even think to include such content. 
How does one include curriculum in support of BDS without pointing out all sides of the story? 
How many Arabs living in and next to Israel do have stable jobs and income because of current 
Israeli laws? How many of those people will become unemployed?How does one take a 
democratic government, like Israel, and demonize it, even slightly, the way it's being presented 
in the curriculum? Perhaps if Israel supported terrorism, terrorists and suicide bombings, as 
many of its neighbors do,one could make an argument! But please! 

As a tax payer supporting the public school system, (and a teacher in Los Angeles),it is 
imperative that any curriculum presented be unbiased and accurate, not curriculum that is 
biased and supported by some very nasty groups and individuals.  

I also want to thank the California legislature, in particular, the California Legislative Jewish 
Caucus for their time and attention on this matter. 

Regards,
