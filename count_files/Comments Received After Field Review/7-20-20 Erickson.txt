Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

I urge you all to include Arab American studies as part of Asian American 
studies.  With the current rise of  white nationalism, Islamophobia and xenophobia, 
it very important  to teach students about diversity, tolerance and about the 
experience of  Americans from West Asia. This must include Palestine  history and 
the Palestinian struggle for human rights. Palestinian existence is 
not  antisemitic.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights should be 
taught.  Students needs to know why it is universal and how to apply it to all 
people without exception.  Please listen to Arab American scholars and Ethnic 
Studies practitioners and collaborate with them as you revise school curricula.
