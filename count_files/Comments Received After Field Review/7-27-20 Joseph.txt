Subject: [EXTERNAL] It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support the 
inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum. The world is what 
it is and is made up of people with diverse views and beliefs. It is important to learn about that 
diversity so that it doesn't paralyze you from understanding your options. 

Sincerely, 
Cassondra Joseph
