Re: Ethnic Studies Proposed Curriculum 
WE ARE STRONGLY OPPOSED TO PROPOSING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS BEING ENCOURAGED TO TEACH 
YOUNG, IMPRESSIONABLE STUDENTS SUCH DIVISIVE AND DAMAGING OPINIONS ABOUT OUR HISTORY. 
Where would our Nation be today without Capitalism? To label such as Oppression is to support Socialism! Where 
can you go in this World and find a-free, productive society under Socialism? 
The draft report needs much editting!
