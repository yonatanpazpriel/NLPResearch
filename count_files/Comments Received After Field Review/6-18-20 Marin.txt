Hello Trustees,  

In this time, we will be remembered for the acts of courage we took.  It is courageous to stand 
on the side of equity. I've lived in this community for [# of years] and in 2020, it is about time 
we got Ethnic Studies.  I am fully expecting this board to make real its resolution by getting 
more Ethnic Studies classes, with more Ethnic Studies teachers.   

We have a long way to go, and I am holding you accountable to you supporting the model 
curriculum for Ethnic Studies. The time is now for racial justice. Don't delay. 

Best, 
Katelin Marin
