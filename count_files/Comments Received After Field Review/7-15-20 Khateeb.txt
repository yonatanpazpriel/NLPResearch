Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM 

Hello,  

As a former student that has been through the California public school system, the need for ESMC wit the 
inclusion of Arab American studies. The youth are exposed to a presidency that is allowed to express 
inaccurate portraits of communities of people without major repercussions. Anti- racist education needs to 
become a central focus in the California, seen with the national uprisings in response to the murder of 
George Floyd and xenophobic language targeting the Asian American communities. Having Arab 
American studies, but the erasure of the Palestinian struggle will be counterproductive. Palestinians are 
actively experimenting and ethnic cleansing and any erasure or misinformation will apart of 
it. TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report 
researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to AYOâ€™s 
findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs 
and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. 
The need for this curriculum is essential to the identity forming among Arab American and Muslim youth 
in California; something my non Arab, non Muslim classmates, and I could have benefited from.
