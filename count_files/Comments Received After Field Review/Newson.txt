If you are going to forget about Jews as an ethnic group and eliminate teaching their history you 
must be fare and unbiased. That would mean Cancelling Black History Month, Easter 
celebrations, Christmas Vacation and any acknowledgement any religious holiday. 

Letâ€™s remember that the foundation of Western Culture is Judaism, and their story of slavery 
must be told, as well as the discrimination they they suffered in this world, just like Catholics.
