Hello Trustees,  

 OFFICE OF THE CITY COUNCIL 
 CITY OF DALY CITY 
 333 â€“ 90TH STREET 
 DALY CITY, CA  94015-1895 

I appreciate everything you have accomplished this year from providing affordable housing for our 
teachers in our district to supporting our students, and their families through the Covid-19 Pandemic. 
As a fellow elective official, I write this letter to urge you to support the model Ethnic Studies 
curriculum. I come from an Ethnic Studies background that allowed me to learn about my history, 
identity, and how it has informed my purpose to serve my community. Ethnic Studies gave me a lens 
to understand my identity of being a child of Filipino immigrants; the legacy of labor organizers; the 
understanding of how racism, gender and sexuality, and class affects our society. I have mentored 
thousands of students to become Ethnic Studies teachers and leaders in the Bay Area and abroad 
over the past two decades through my organization, the Pin@y Educational Partnerships (PEP) and 
as an Instructor at Skyline College. It has widened my scope to serve communities beyond sense of 
charity, but to cultivate a critical community to become agents of change. 

You are in place of leadership to take the historical step to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. 
Ethnic Studies has transformed the lives of my community, my students, and family to understand 
that they are part of the curriculum and are authors of history. On February 27, 2020, I strongly 
endorsed the passage of Ethnic Studies in Jefferson Elementary School District (JESD). JESD Board 
unanimously passed a resolution to become the first elementary and middle school district to 
implement Ethnic Studies in the nation. I hope you will join them, and the growing list of districts in 
CA, to pass the model Ethnic Studies curriculum for your community. Ethnic Studies is needed more 
than ever for students to learn about the history of race and racism in America and abroad to give 
context to understanding why Black Lives Matter and to transform our society with compassion, love, 
and hope.  

Sincerely, 

Dr. Roderick Daus-Magbual 
Council Member 
City of Daly City
