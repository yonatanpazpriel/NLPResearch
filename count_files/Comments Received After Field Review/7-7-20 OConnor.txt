Subject: [EXTERNAL] Supporting the inclusion of Arab American Studies within Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Hello, 

I'm a LA county resident writing to voice my support for including Arab American Studies in the 
Ethnic Studies Curriculum, under the rubric of Asian American Studies.  As Xenophobia and 
Islamophobic racism are a core issue faced by our country, including the experiences of West 
Asian Americans in the ESMC is essential to equipping our young citizens with the education 
they need to engage with politics, life, and social responsibility. 

In the era that's seen a continual war on terror in Middle Eastern countries, an uptick in violent 
hate crimes against Arab Americans, and our country's president discuss a "Muslim ban," it's 
clear that Arab Americans have a unique identity and experience on which our country's future 
citizens direly need education. 

Furthermore, I think it's especially important to include the history and current struggles of 
Palestine in the curriculum, given the uniquely large role Palestine plays in our country's foreign 
policy.  Palestinian-Americans have a unique experience that it is crucial for our education to 
include.  US aid to Israel is more than aid to every other country combined, and our country is 
home to many Palestinian American refugees that were displaced from their homes with the 
support of American funding and weapons. Educating young people on Palestine is in no way 
anti-Semitic, and in fact will only promote a broad ethics of racial justice that includes opposing 
anti-Semitism.  As our country continues to fund Israel in illegally annexing land, enforcing 
racially discriminatory policies, preventing millions of refugees from returning to their homes, 
and engaging in military actions that kill thousands, we need education on Palestine now more 
than ever. 

Thank you for your consideration.
