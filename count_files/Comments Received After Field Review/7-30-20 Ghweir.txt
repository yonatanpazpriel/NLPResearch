Subject: [EXTERNAL] The Inclusion of Arab American Studies 

Hello, 

I am a University student who is deeply concerned over the possible exclusion of West Asian 
Studies within the rubric of Asian American Studies. Today's political climate demands educated 
students. Excluding the rich history of West Asia, including Palestine, is very dangerous. The 
history of Palestine goes beyond the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict by thousands of years. Speaking 
and learning about all parts of Palestine is not antisemitic, but erasing Palestinian history from 
the curriculum is xenophobic and Islamophobic. Educated students have a right to learn about 
the Conflict and issues currently playing a role in Palestine's history. The revisions that affect 
Arab American students should be done in collaboration with Arab American students. Arab 
American students have a right to have their voices heard and their histories taught. That is the 
best way to help ensure the best possible education for all students and creating an inclusive 
curriculum. Thank you for your consideration.
