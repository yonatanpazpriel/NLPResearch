I would appreciate clarification regarding the development and implementation of the Ethnic Studies Program as it 
relates to the Jewish Cultural Experience. I have been asked to provide explanation regarding the published accounts 
that are accused of being bias, misleading, or inaccurate accounts of the historical record of the Jewish experience in 
the US. My client base is composed of professional, college graduate, and community motivated people. Many with 
children who will be attending the neighborhood public schools. My client base is most interested in a fair and 
accurate study of all ethnic groups.  
Thank you, 
Leslie Randall
