Congratulations to the CDE for realizing that the current Ethnic Studies Program needs rewriting. The fact that the 
program existed in its present bigoted and anti-Semitic format without any review by the CDE, is irresponsible. How 
many students were influenced by the current program? 

Make sure when you review the new curriculum there is no mention of Nobel Prize Laureates. It could prove 
embarrassing to the bigots and anti-Semites that according to Wikipedia of the over 900 Nobel prizes issued, 20% 
were issued to Jews! Now I don't know how many Arabs there are in the world, but the number of Jews in the world is 
.2% of the world population!  

I hope you also remove all references to the acronym BDS and all it stands for. 

I shall look forward to reviewing the new Ethnic Studies Program. 

Regards, Sam Josephson
