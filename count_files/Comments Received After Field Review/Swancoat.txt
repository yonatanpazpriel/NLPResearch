What are you doing to California’s future? 

This once great state deserves more from its educators. 

After reviewing excerpts from the new curriculum I am aghast that our 
educators would push their political agenda. Trying to brainwash young 
minds is disgusting. 

Capitalism, while not perfect, is the best economic system in the world. 
If capitalism is such a bad system, why are so many people trying to get 
into the United States? Why do so few leave the United States? 
Capitalism has done more to bring individuals out of poverty than any 
other factor. 

The teaching that BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) as it applies to 
Israel is “Criminal”! This is anti-semitic and does not explain Israel’s side 
of the argument. You are training our youth to be young Nazis. How 
would you feel if your neighbor was throwing explosives into your 
backyard? 

Why are we teaching young children about criminals such as Angela 
Davis, Frantz Fanon and Assata Shakur? These individuals are not 
heroes. The only thing we should be teaching young people about these 
individuals is that you do what they do and you go to jail. 

I could go on with all the junk in this curriculum, but I think that you get 
the gist of my thoughts on the proposed curriculum.  

May I suggest that we focus on teaching our young children the basics 
that will allow them to compete in the global economy.  

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition, I request that the educators take politics out of the 
curriculum or at least make it bipartisan.
