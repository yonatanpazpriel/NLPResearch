Subject: [EXTERNAL] The Save California Ethnic Studies Program 

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote 
the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the 
teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

In other words please don’t allow a program that masquerades as being inclusive to one group that spreads hatred to another 
group. 

I want my children to make friends at school and not made to feel like their race and religion is bad by a curriculum of lies. 

Thank you, 

Alan
