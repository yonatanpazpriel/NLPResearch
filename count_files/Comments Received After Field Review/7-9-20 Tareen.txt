Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American Studies! 

Hello! 

In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American, South Asian, and all POC 
students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities. 
Please protect and respect studies from all backgrounds.  

Thank you for your help.
