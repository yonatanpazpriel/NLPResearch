Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

As an Arab American who is now an educator, I remember feeling disconnected to what I was 
learning in school and felt uncomfortable with how little others knew of my culture beyond 
insults and stereotypes. Arab American studies is critical in a country rife with Islamophobia and 
racism. I honestly don't even understand how this is debatable.  

All people deserve to have their histories reflected in what they study - and in a nation of 
immigrants, how could this not include Arab and Islamic histories and contributions.  

TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report 
researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to 
AYOâ€™s findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their 
information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about 
Arabs and/or Muslims at school.  

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
Alia Ghabra
