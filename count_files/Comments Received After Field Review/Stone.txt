Unfortunately, I had to read through pages and pages before the insidious agenda became clear. 
Fortunately, I did so. How can the State of California in good conscience replace old known 
bigotries with newer, more subtle ones? We should be moving toward a time of inclusion and 
kindness, not baseless hatred.  

Yes, we need to remove the old bigotry from our schools, and develop an abiding appreciation of 
the merit and worth of each individual. Instead, a curriculum of divisiveness us proposed. Please 
reconsider the long-term harm this agenda will inflict.
