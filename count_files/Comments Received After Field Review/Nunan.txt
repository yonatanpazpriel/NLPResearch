I am appalled at reading about the new curriculum about to be introduced to public schools, as read in this link: 

https://albertmohler.com/2019/08/14/hxrstory-cisheteropatriarchy-and-the-remaking-of-america-a-new-curriculum-
emerges-in-california 

The state of California is now establishing an "ethnic studies" curriculum for public schools, particularly for high 
schools in the state 

“California’s Education Department has issued an ethnic studies model curriculum and is soliciting public comments 
on it until August 15. The legislatively mandated guide is a resource for teachers who want to instruct their students in 
the field of ethnic studies and was written by an advisory board of teachers, academics, and bureaucrats.” 

It is an educational agenda aimed at a total societal transformation of American culture.  

Another element glaringly absent from this proposed curriculum is the idea of critical inquiry and critical thinking. We 
might think that a natural curriculum for high school students is to present them with differing points of view so that 
they can learn the process of contemplative evaluation, developing a spirit of discernment.  

After reading the article, I want to register my grave concern over this radical and socialist agenda, and, as someone 
who has dedicated thousands of hours to the public schools, want to say that parents will not stand for this 
curriculum. 

I seriously hope you will reconsider this one sided method of teaching.
