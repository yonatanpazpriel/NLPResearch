Subject: Sikh inclusion in CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

My name is Noblejot, I live in California. I attend Clovis North High School in Clovis Unified 
School District. I am currently in the 11th grade.   

As a Sikh high schooler I feel like an excluded figure in the classroom. We read about German 
and Irish immigrants, Native American figureheads, Latino revolutionaries, Asian Emperors and 
African American idols. Yet with all this diversity, my community fails to addressed within the 
classroom. 

This lack in education leads to other students questioning the importance of my history. I have 
received remarks about the “Khanda” (the main symbol of Sikhism) in which students recognize 
it as Star Wars. I have been told that Sikh history within America and India is not significant in 
“the grand scheme of things” from my peers from a conversation. Even my world history class 
failed to properly mention Sikhism and its major influence in India, let alone America, as all of 
Sikhism’s influence is crammed in a few bullet points. 

I wish for Sikhs, like myself, to have the same place as other ethnicities in our classrooms. At 
least then my history will be significant in “the grand scheme of things”.
