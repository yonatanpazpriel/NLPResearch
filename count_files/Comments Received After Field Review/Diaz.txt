Subject: Keeping anti-semitism out of our public schools  

Can our schools just stick to teaching our children the basics!! This 
dangerous radical indoctrination has no place in our so called 
“educational system.” Teaching “sex education”, Revised history and 
now “ethnic studies.” Enough already!! There is no place in our schools 
(using our tax dollars) for this garbage!
