Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum -- Include Arab American Studies 

I am writing to support the inclusion of Arab American Studies in the model ethnic studies 
curriculum. 

A strong ethnic studies curriculum is a necessity if we are to move forward as an inclusive and 
just society. The ferocity of the portion of the population that is determined to impose white 
supremacy must be met by a quality public education, so that young people are empowered to 
oppose racism and all other oppressions. Particularly in this time, when people of color are 
disparately impacted by COVID-19, the economic crisis, and police violence, educating students 
about the many heritages, cultures, and conditions faced by people in our state and in the 
nation is the very least we can do. 

I am queer and I am a Jew. I believe it is incredibly important to include Arab American studies, 
with a strong component that addresses the experience of Palestinians both at home and in 
diaspora. The opponents of strong ethnic studies programs are using false charges of anti-
Semitism to undermine the work of communities of color in developing this curriculum. It is in 
fact anti-Semitic to believe that those hateful voices are representing Jews. 

I have been part of the struggle to include support for queer and trans youth in our schools. 
Queer/trans people are in every ethnicity. Therefore curriculum must be intersectional. 
Palestinians and Arab Americans aren't important part of that intersectionality, 

Thank you for your attention. 

Sincerely
