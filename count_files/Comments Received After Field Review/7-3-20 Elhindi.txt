Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American Studies 

Hello. It has come to my attention that is a move to cancel Arab American Studies from 
California public colleges. As an Arab American, I ask you to please reconsider and prevent this 
from happening. The erasure of Arab American Studies is an attack on my heritage and culture 
and is a politically motivated  

cheap trick that only harms cultural diversity and inter-ethnic understanding. Thank you for 
understanding!
