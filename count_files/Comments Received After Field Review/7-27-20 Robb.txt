Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti- Israel curriculum 

I am strongly against any curriculum being taught in our higher educational institutions that promotes Anti-Israel 
bias.  
This is shameful and is unconscionable . This is racism and is not only highly offensive, it is against the very fabric of 
the ways of justice and truth that made this the greatest country on earth: America. 

Please do not let the consciences of our young people be polluted by this propaganda. 

Sincerely, 
Susan Robb
