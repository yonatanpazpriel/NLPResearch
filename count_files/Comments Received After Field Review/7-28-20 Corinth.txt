Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies 
curriculum.  

Ethnic Studies is a critical subject area in our globalizing world, in order to broaden the 
understanding, open-mindedness, and empathy of our citizens to create a just and equitable 
society.  

Ethnic Studies has also been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social 
outcomes for students.  

Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, 
have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.  

In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American students are 
particularly in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities. 

Sincerely, 
Elizabeth Corinth
