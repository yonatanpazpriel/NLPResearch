Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in California Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Dear Commissioners: 

It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies are. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the 
xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as “vectors” of disease, and the national uprising in response to the 
murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education. All students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 
curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other. 
Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students.  
In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump’s Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of 
curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.  
According to a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO), more 
than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the 
internet or television. This is like learning about sexuality from pornography websites. Only 2.3% learned about 
Arabs and/or Muslims at school.  
Please include Arab American Studies in the California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. 

Thank you.
