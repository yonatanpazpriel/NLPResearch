Subject: Anti-Semitic/anti-Israel bias taught in public institutions 

To whom it may concern, 

It is appalling to witness numerous examples of openly anti-
semitic/anti-Israel bias that is deemed acceptable in mainstream 
society today through the inaction of others or what is allowed in public 
school curriculum. 
It is sad to see so many organizations that fight for their respective 
protected classes they represent have tremendous influence on what is 
allowable curriculum yet when it comes to anti-Semitic/anti-Israel bias 
there is still serious issues of this kind of propaganda excreting into the 
education system that ultimately leads to violence against Jewish 
people.  

The excrement cited in attached email is an example of a view deemed 
acceptable by learning institutions regarding BDS as “a social 
organization that defends the rights of another group of people.” A 
large number states have already determined BDS to be an anti-Semitic 
movement under the guise of a social movement and therefore has 
bans in place for involvement with such organizations. To think that the 
state of California which claims to be so “progressive “ accepts an 
organization that is well known to hold ideologies that incite hatred and 
violence towards Jews is indeed very upsetting. Whomever is 
responsible for taking action needs to act objectively on all issues 
similar to the example cited otherwise s/he is unfit for the position and 
should thereby be removed.
