Subject: [EXTERNAL] Protesting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft Currently being adopted by 
CA school boards 

To Whom It May Concern,  

I, Hedy Woolf,  am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently 
being adopted by California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish 
Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, 
fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out 
Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in 
our public schools.” 

I find this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft to be misleading, discriminatory, and 
anti-Semitic. Please adapt a program that encompasses ethnic studies in a fair way and 
stop trying to teach our kids that Israel and the Jewish people are to be hated.  

Please take my protest in the same concern that you take BLM. 

Sincerely, 

Hedy Woolf
