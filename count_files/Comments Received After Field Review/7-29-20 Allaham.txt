Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on Arab American Studies 

Greetings, 

I am a Muslim Arab-American student in the United States. I’ve attended and been in cohort 
with many academic institutions across this nation. In this era of rampant Islamophobia and 
xenophobia it is important for Arab and West Asian American studies to be taught in schools to 
build empathy and solidarity across causes and reduce the suffering and trauma of West Asian 
and Arab students in institutions. If you are really interested in racial equity and diversity then 
you would acknowledge and keep Arab and West Asian american studies at least. The fact that 
you are attempting to remove them is oppressive and will go down on the wrong side of 
history. Palestinians exist, their suffering is real, their pain is real, removing them from a 
curriculum won’t silence their voices or the voices of their allies. It is not anti Semitic to defend 
the human rights of Palestinians or other Arabs. I demand that revisions that affect Arab 
American studies be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies 
practitioners or else it’s erasure and oppression. 

Look at your morality, 
Shafiq Alsayed Allaham
