Dear Department of Education;  

I am writing to express my extreme distress at the proposed new ethnic studies curriculum being 
proposed for CA public schools. I do not doubt that there is a deep need for such a program; however, 
the lack of any discussion about anti-Semitism and specifically touting the BDS movement as 'a social 
movement whose aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice' when, in reality, BDS is 
truly about eliminating Israel from the map--'from the river to the sea, all Palestine shall 
be free' means exactly that. 

The recent attacks on synagogues in Poway and Pittsburgh show that anti-Semitism is 
on the rise in the US and must be discussed in any new curricula. To ignore this is to 
raise a new generation of unaware and under-educated young people. 

The state of California can ill-afford this. 

Yours, 
Marla K. Goldstein
