California needs to STOP the Ethnic Studies Curriculum Studies. It is nothing more than 
progressive left indoctrination of the young minds of our children and young adults. It is a 
travesty and disservice to them and to the future of our country. Only great harm can come to 
them as they inter the work force and live their day to day lives after this indoctrination. Their 
heads will be filled with this anti-Semitic, anti-American, and anti-free market nonsense. Stop! 
This radical progressive curriculum DOES NOT belong in public schools.
