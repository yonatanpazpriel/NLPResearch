Dear Mr. Thurmond, 
I recently read a brief article about the update to the Ethnic Studies curriculum proposal. I want to thank you and urge 
you to continue to support a strong curriculum framework that reflects a commitment and focus on the four 
foundational ethnic and racial groups. Focusing on this evidence-based academic foundation will ensure that 
students can better contextualize US History, and it will prepare them to be well informed and engaged citizens who 
can understand and respect America's social and historical precedents. 
Thank you for your courage to uphold a strong evidence-based ethnic studies curriculum. 
Nancy Flores
