Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

I am a Special Education teacher. I support: 
Arab American studies within the rubric of Asian 
American studies. 
• in this era of Islamophobia and xenophobia, it’s 
important to include West Asian American 
experiences in the ESMC. 
• that the history and current struggles in Palestine be 
included. 
• it is not antisemitic to defend human rights, and 
include Palestinian history and current movements in 
ethnic studies. 
• that revisions that affect Arab American studies 
should be made in collaboration with Arab American 
scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners.  

With the racial disparities in effects of Covid 19, the demonization of 
Asian Americans as "vectors" of disease, and the national uprising 
against anti-Black state violence, critical Ethnic Studies curriculum is 
more urgent than ever. To exclude Arab American Studies from Ethnic 
Studies is not only a form of censorship, it undermines unity and 
solidarity at the core of anti-racist teaching. 

Sincerely, 

Therese Kelleghan
