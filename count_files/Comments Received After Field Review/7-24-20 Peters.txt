Hello, 

As a California home owner and tax payer, I am very concerned by a school curriculum that 
supports anti- semitic biases.   

We must be very careful at this time to break down all stereotypes and not stigmatize any 
individual groups. We see too much false information touted on all media. As those responsible 
for educating our youth, you have a moral and legal duty to promote the basis of the 
constitution, recognizing the value, worth and right of each individual to safely pursue their 
religious beliefs.  

We have all seen what the rise of anti-semitism did in Germany. Please ensure you take steps 
now to stop it from happening in California.  

Best regards, 
Francine Peters
