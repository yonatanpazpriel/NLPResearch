Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of ESMC & Arab American Studies 

Dear Commission, 

I am writing in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and specifically the inclusion of 
Arab American Studies. 

As a Jewish American educated in public schools for K-12, an African & African American 
Studies major during my undergraduate studies at Stanford, a former public school teacher, and 
now a higher education administrator, I know firsthand how critical ethnic studies curriculum 
are for students of all ages, both for insight into one's own cultural history and that of others. 

Ethnic Studies has always been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social 
outcomes for students, but it has never been as urgent as now, with rises in xenophobic attacks 
during COVID-19, police and vigilante violence against Black people across the country, and 
more. In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American students 
especially are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current 
realities. Specifically, I never learned about Palestinian or Palestinian American history or 
current struggles as a student and never felt welcomed to teach that history during my time as 
a public school teacher, creating a massive knowledge gap and leaving space for dangerous 
generalizations and assumptions to fill that gap. 

We must do better for our young people now that we have the opportunity. The ESMC, Arab 
American Studies specifically, and opportunities to learn about Palestinian past and present 
within that are all critical for young people across California to be able to develop a strong 
sense of themselves and of U.S. and world history. I hope the commission will take full 
advantage of this opportunity by approving the ESMC with Arab American Studies and 
Palestine included! 

Warmly,
