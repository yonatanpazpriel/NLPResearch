Dear Soomin Chao: 
The Model Curriculum being adopted by California School Boards is excellent 
for encouraging Jew-hatred and hostility toward Israel.  And it will help 
promote the agenda and careers of antisemites like Tlaib and Omar and 
Sarsour.  
If this is your agenda, you should see spectacular results in increased 
aggression toward Jews in a few years after the current group of students 
have absorbed the poison. 
Yours truly, 
Dr. Samuel Hilt
