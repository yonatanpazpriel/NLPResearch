Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab-American Studies 

Instructional Quality Commission, 

My name is Jennifer Terada and I am a resident of Rancho Palos Verdes, CA. I am writing in support of 
the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum (ESMC), including Arab American Studies. I've grown up in 
California and currently attend UC Berkeley. Knowing my university's struggle behind our historic Ethnic 
Studies Department, I am aware of the reservations you may have on this subject. However, it is 
beneficial for all students to have the opportunity to learn about different cultures, especially in a state 
as diverse as ours. K-12 students need ethnic studies education to build empathy, unity, and solidarity 
with each other. 

Arab American Studies must be included within the rubric of American Studies. In this era of 
Islamophobia and xenophobia, it's important to also include West Asian American experiences in 
ESMC. In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American students are 
desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities. As a 
Japanese American student, I understand what it feels like to have my history barely touched 
upon throughout my K-12 education. 

In this curriculum, the history and current struggles of Palestine must be included. It is not anti-
semitic to defend human rights and include Palestinian history and current movements within 
ethnic studies. When revising school curriculum, I urge you to collaborate with Arab American 
scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. Help shape the lives of young Californians for the better. 

Please include Arab American Studies in ESMC! 

Sincerely, 
Jennifer Terada
