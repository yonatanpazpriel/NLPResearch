To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school 
boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American 
Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 
criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

How is it possible for good people to accept a divisive educational program that will unavoidably cause rejection of 
those whom it teaches are worthy of disdain? This is a time to double down on kindness and inclusiveness for all, 
certainly not a time to single out the Jewish people for demonization. Is the heart of those making these decisions 
not big enough for all peoples? 

Thank you for your kind attention.
