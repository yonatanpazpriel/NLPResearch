Subject: [EXTERNAL] Chair of the California Instructional Quality Commission Soomin Chao 

I fully reject and abhor the anti Semitic - anti Jewish - Anti Israel bias and the 
racism of the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
(ESMCD). 

We do not agree that promoting a radical and violent biased agenda based in 
Arab Nationalism and encouraged by the Muslim Brotherhood - a pro - Nazi 
organization, is either in the interest of community well being, peace or in teh 
interests of our children, 

This form of blind acceptance of radical ideology has no place in the school 
curriculum. 

Therefore I urge you that this NOT be adopted into the California school 
system. 

Respectfully, 

Jeffrey Solomon
