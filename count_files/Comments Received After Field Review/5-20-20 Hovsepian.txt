Dear Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee,  

The  Armenian  National  Committee  of  America  -  Western  Region  (ANCA-WR)  reaffirms  our 
support  for  the  CA  Ethnic  Studies  framework  draft,  with  revisions  and  additions  of  the  West 
Asian experience, specifically in relation to Armenian-Americans.  

ANCA-WR strongly supports the intention to create a curriculum that “presents an opportunity 
for  teachers  to  develop  culturally/community  relevant  and  responsive  pedagogies  that  are  both 
revitalizing  and  sustaining.”  We  welcome  the  drafters’  efforts  to  include,  and  urge  further 
development  on,  more  expansive  definitions  of  West  Asian  American  diasporan  experiences, 
inclusive  of  peoples  historically  marginalized  from  California  curricula,  and  United  States 
scholarship writ large, such as Armenian-Americans.  

Please know that we have a wealth of resources, materials, and talent in the field of Armenian-
American Studies that can help with preparing units in this course of study that would give voice 
to the generations of families and their children who have long waited to have their stories told. 
Please feel free to call upon us. We stand ready to assist you as needed. 

We look forward to contributing, supporting, and celebrating the outcome of the Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum in California’s public schools that truly represents the diversity of our State. 
We  look  forward  to  continued  dialogue  and  welcome  the  draft’s  expansion  to  include  the 
realities of groups from the region using experts within the field of Ethnic Studies. 

Sincerely Yours,  

Nora Hovsepian, Esq.
