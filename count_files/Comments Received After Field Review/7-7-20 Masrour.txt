Dear California Department of Education, 

I believe, after reading the draft of the ethnic studies curriculum, it is anti-semitic and does not acknowledge the 
amount of hate that is put towards the Jewish community, being that the Jewish people in this state receive the 
second most amount of hate crimes, right below the Latino community, who has a much larger population. Please 
revise this program, because the Jewish people do not get enough recognition for the contributions they make to 
this country, and to the world.  
Thank you
