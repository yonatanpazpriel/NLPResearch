Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American Studies 

Hi,  

My name is Emara and I am in full support of saving Arab American studies and ESMC. I am a 
college student, and have been in classroom settings where there is a lack of understanding 
Arab Americans and their history. Education allows for people to gain understanding of history, 
culture, and life of people around the world. By hindering this, we allow for ignorance to 
prevail. Please, save Arab studies and make it a priority.
