Subject: [EXTERNAL] Your Complicity in Efforts that Can Support Ethic Cleansing of Jews 

Dear Sir: 

I strongly object to the anti-Israel curriculum that has been approved by various school 
boards.  That Israel is very far from perfect is a given.  But it is also under attack by those, many 
powerful enemies, who openly state their intention to kill or expel all the Jews.  So-called 
progressives are always excusing the threats, but top leaders of Iran and Hezbollah are not at all 
reticent about expressing their desire to exterminate or expel the Jews.   Many examples 
abound. By teaching the subject in a way that does not understand or explain the context of the 
situation, schools using the new curriculum become complicit in attempts at ethnic cleansing of 
the Jews of Israel. 

Our children should be taught that Israel shares our values generally, while few if any of its 
enemies do.  Whether it is female circumcision or the rights of gay people to lice normal lives or 
imposition of religious law on those not wishing to be bound, the list goes on and on.  California 
children should be asked what they would do if Syria was 20-50 miles from their home?   

You are complicit in efforts that over time can result in the deaths of tens of thousands if not 
more Jews in Israel.
