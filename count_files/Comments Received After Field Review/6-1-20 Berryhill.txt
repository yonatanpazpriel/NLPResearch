Secretary Thurmond, 

I urge you to make sure that the process of developing an ethnic studies curriculum for our state doesn’t 
further divide and exclude. It is admirable to make an effort to create a curriculum that can help California 
children grow up to appreciate the values of inclusivity and opportunity for all. However, there is an 
obvious attempt by some to use this process to continue to exclude groups (including but not limited to 
Jewish people) who have been and continue to be targets of hate in this state and around the world. If the 
goal is inclusivity and not repeating history, then don’t repeat history by listening to those who aim to 
remove people from the “list” of those deemed worthy to be included.  

No ethnic or religious group should be left out of this curriculum, so it must include definitions 
and discussion of anti-Semitism. One can see why the authors left a definition of anti-Semitism 
out of the glossary because if it were there, it would be obvious that in other places in the 
document (lines 5157-61 and 5802-03), the language of the curriculum itself is anti-Semitic. 
Education must not be political. The point of this curriculum should not be to indoctrinate 
children into a political viewpoint. Teach them the truth about ALL groups, and they will grow 
up to help solve the political problems. 

Sincerely, 

Katie J. Berryhill, Ed.D.
