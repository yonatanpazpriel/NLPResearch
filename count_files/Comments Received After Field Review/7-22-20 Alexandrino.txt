Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include Arab American studies 

I am writing as an educator who taught scores of Arab American students. I am asking for 
inclusion of Arab American history and culture in the curriculum of West Asian Studies. This 
experience is not known and therefore resides outside of the awareness of the dominant 
culture. Because of that, we lose an tremendous asset in cultural richness and inclusion. It is a 
loss that impoverishes us all. 

In times when we came (finally!) to recognize the dire need of confronting racism and 
discrimination head on, let us make sure that we make a place to teach and talk about the 
oppressed -- in this case making sure that Arab Americans, and within those, the Palestinians in 
the Diaspora and in Palestine, are brought from the shadows to the light of compassion and 
understanding.  

My Jewish values mandate that I add my voice to those who defend the silenced, discriminated 
and/or dispossessed, making sure their stories and their history are an integral part of our 
common knowledge. 

I stress the need to be inclusive in an active, affirmative way. Let us recognize all of our 
stories -  and let us remember that some laws of racist discrimination still happen -- such 
as the Muslim bans. 

Africa is beautiful, paz
