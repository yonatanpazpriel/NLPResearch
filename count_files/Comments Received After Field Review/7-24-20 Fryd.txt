   To whom it may concern: 
      I am sending this e- mail, because I am concerned about the ESMCD, a curriculum which omits the Jewish 
American experience, the vast contributions of the Jewish people, to our great country’s mosaic of ethnicity. 
      This curriculum promotes stereotypes of the Jewish people, anti- Semitic tropes, antithetical to our democratic 
ideals, of tolerance, and good will, towards all peoples. 
       There should be no anti- Israel rhetoric.  
       Let’s have a curriculum that encompasses the contributions of all peoples, that have made this the greatest 
nation. 
       We need a curriculum which proposes understanding of all, respect for all, and tolerance.  
       Kindly consider my suggestion. 
                              Respectfully,  
                                 Debra Fryd
