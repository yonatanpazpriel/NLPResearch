To whom it may concern: 

Please find attached my input regarding model Ethnic Studies curriculum. 

Unfortunately I find it unacceptable. It openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits 
anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. 

In the atmosphere of increasing anti-Semitic hate crimes in California, when the Jewish community 
remains by far the largest target of religion-motivated hate crimes, one would expect that Public School 
curriculum would contribute to a fight against anti-Semitism. But sadly, proposed curriculum would only 
promote hateful feelings against Jews and Israel. 

I respectfully ask to reject this curriculum and replace it with the one that does not marginalize Jews and 
Israel. 

Thank you.
