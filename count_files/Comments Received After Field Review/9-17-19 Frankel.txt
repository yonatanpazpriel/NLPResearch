Subject: Ethnic studies to include anti- semitism 

Hello, 
I am writing to you as a Jew and a retired classroom teacher with 14 years of 
experience.  
I am saddened and alarmed to learn that the original ethnic studies curriculum left out 
the teaching of Anti- Semitism, but included anti- Israel sentiments. With anti- semitic 
hate crimes on the rise in this current culture, how could this be? With the shootimg at 
the Pittsberg Tree of Life Synogogue, how could this be? Jews are the minority of the 
minority! Why would you forget us? 
Just last week at the high school where I reside, Staples High School in Westport, CT, 
there were swastikas and Fuck Jews written on the walls! The superintendent had to 
send out an email to all parents! Imagine if not teaching about anti- semitism was NOT 
in the curriculum!? Is it only for blacks, Mexicans, and Muslims? You do not think Jews 
are targets for some odd reason? We are not all wealthy Hollywood and finance execs ( 
another TROPE you need to teach!). 
I am telling you that the Republican party is having a heydey with this one! Please do 
not let them win and be right that California is being hupocritical about teaching 
tolerance!üôèüôè 
Sincerely, 
Stephanie P Frankel
