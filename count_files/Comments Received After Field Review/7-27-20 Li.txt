Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for ESMC 

Hi, 
I am writing in support of ESMC including Arab American studies within the rubric of Asian 
American studies. Including Palestinian history and struggle within the ethnic studies 
curriculum is not anti semitic. A curriculum without this denies Arab American studentsâ€™ 
histories and realities. Zionist opposition does not speak for the entire Jewish American 
community - look to JVP to see real coalition building and unity against white supremacy. How 
can young people continue to do this work when what they learn in school is inherently 
Islamophobic and white-centered?  

Thank you.
