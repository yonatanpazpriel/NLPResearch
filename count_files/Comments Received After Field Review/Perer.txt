Dear Sirs, 

Sometimes the best intentions go astray. That's what's happened here with the ESMC.  
However well purposed this needs revised so as to inoffensive to all member of 
this a very diverse community. Obviously you people fell, likely unknowingly, into 
some serious traps. Please listen to the criticism of the members of the Jewish  
community and revise this. 

Let me add parenthetically, a sizeable number, but still pretty small minority of Jews  
agree in some measure with the BSD movement's purpose, if not it's implementation 
or the nefarious aims of some its supporters toward Israel. This too needs to be revised 
to explain in some cases it's being used to try to destroy Israel as a country.  

It all needs rethought and revised. Good will on everyone's part will make this a better, 
fairer, document for all our children to learn from. 

Howard Perer M.D.
