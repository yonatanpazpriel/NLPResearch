Subject: [EXTERNAL] Strongly Support the ESMC! 

Hello, 

I am a San Francisco parent, grandparent and educator.  I am writing to voice my strong support for 
the intact Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) proposal, including the Arab American Studies 
curriculum. 

The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: 
American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. 
Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies 
within Asian American studies. Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association 
of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies 
in the CA ESMC. 

It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-
19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as “vectors” of disease, and the national uprising in 
response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All 
students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, awareness and the ability to 
live and work together in a unified fashion. 

As a person of Jewish background I do not think that it is at all antisemitic to include Palestinian 
history and the current reality in the curriculum. It is very important for students to have an 
informed framework for understanding world events today. 

Again, I urge you to support the ESMC.  If any revisions are made that affect Arab American studies, 
they should be done in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. 

Thank you,
