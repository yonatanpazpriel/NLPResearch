To: Soomin Chao 

ESMCD’s “Arab American Studies Course Outline,”  promotes anti-Israel boycotts 
(BDS) and focuses on figures accused of anti-Semitism, such as Palestinian-American 
activist Linda Sarsour, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and 
deceased White House correspondent Helen Thomas. 

This is a despicable attempt to indoctrinate California children in an agenda of not-so-
subtle Jew-hatred.  Please revisit any support you might give to this radical, one-sided 
smear of Jewish issues.
