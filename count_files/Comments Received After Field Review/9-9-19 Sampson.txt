As a member of the Jewish community,  
I read this with concern. The people who practice our faith have been historically subjected to scorn, 
stereotyping, and hate crimes. I  think that educators adhering to this bill, if passed, will further promote 
negativity, exacerbating the obstacles we face, and perpetuating increased divisiveness. 

Thank You,
