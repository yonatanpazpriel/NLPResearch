Subject: [EXTERNAL] saving arab american studies 

hello, my name is Ziniab. I live in the Bay Area and want to show my support for saving Arab-American studies. I 
am a student and i support the ESMC. Arab American studies is a part of Asian American studies. Most Arab 
countries are in West Asia. The history of Palestine and current struggle should also be included in the studies. In 
no way is learning about Palestine anti-semitic. Speaking up on human rights, annexation, and the ethnic cleansing 
of Palestine anti-semitic. I hope the revisions that are going to take place in Arab-American studies involve Arab-
American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners.
