To Soomin Chao, California Instructional Quality Commission 

I was astounded to learn that California school boards are considering adopting this anti-Jewish curriculum which is 
full of lies, accusations and false anti-Semitic tropes into the California high school system! 

You are an ethnic person, would you want students to learn a bunch of false information about your cultural group 
which would result in people hating your group because of lies and false information about you? 

This anti-Jewish curriculum must be tossed in the garbage.  Teaching it would result 
in increased hatred, racism, dissent, and actions against Israel.  I don’t think that is what you want for California’s 
high schools.
