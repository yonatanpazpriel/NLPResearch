Subject: [EXTERNAL] Inclusion of Arab Americans in Ethnic Study Curriculum 

Hello,  

I consider Arab American Studies a critical and integral component to Ethnic 
Studies education and believe it should fall under the larger umbrella of Asian 
American studies. Ethnic studies would be sorely incomplete if we did not 
include Arab Americans.  
Best,
