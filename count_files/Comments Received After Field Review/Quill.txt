Hello, 
I would like to know why it is necessary to study this subject. 
Where is the demand?  
Where else in the world is there a similar course of study?  
What will it cost?  
What current subject(s) will be dropped to make way for this academic 
experiment?  
What are the benefits, aims, outcomes that are expected?  
What qualifications are needed to teach this subject? 
How many teachers are qualified to teach it? 
How is accuracy and impartiality assured? 
Why is the draft so obviously biased towards socialist, Marxist doctrine 
and thinking? 
Why aren't there, instead, studies of Western civilisation, the greatest 
ever known?  
Thank you. 
I await your response with great anticipation. 
Regards, 
Ron Quill
