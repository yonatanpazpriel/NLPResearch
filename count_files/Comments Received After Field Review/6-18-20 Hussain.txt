Hello School Board Members, 

I am writing to you today to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft.  Your 
support would mean the world to me. My family and I have lived in the San Mateo Foster City School 
District for 18 years. We have never seen adequate representation of the narratives of people of color and of 
my origin in our textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the community we live in. What I love about 
the model curriculum is that it was written by ethnic studies teachers, professors and educators. Ethnic 
Studies has saved my life. Getting Ethnic Studies into our school district would mean the world to me.  

Your resolution is a moving step for social justice.  From the bottom of my heart: Please make me proud and 
vote for this! 

 Layla Hussain.
