Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Good Afternoon, 

I am writing in request of keeping the Arab American portion in the Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum. I am a public school History teacher here in California and know how important it is 
to uplift the identities of all my students in the curriculum. My Arab and Muslim students 
deserve to have their history and their culture explored and celebrated, just as every other 
group should as well. Including the Arab American experience in ethnic studies is not just 
beneficial to students of that identity. It is also beneficial to the overall student body to learn 
about the experiences of other groups which are different than them. It is not only interesting 
to learn about other groups, but it also useful in eliminating fear and discrimination of other 
groups which someone might not be familiar with. At this time in our country's history, we need 
more diversity in the curriculum, not less.  

Thank you for your consideration.
