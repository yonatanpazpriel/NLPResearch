Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American Studies are critical to the growth of our youth, concept of diversity 
& future life skills 

Hello Commission, 

As someone who works in San Francisco, has worked with students, and who has educators and San 
Francisco school administrators amongst my family and friends, I urge you to include Arab American 
Studies in the California Ethnic Studies Curriculum, including the experiences and struggle of Palestine. 

While San Francisco schools are sometimes diverse, it is still very possible to have homogenous or binary 
ethnic experiences going through San Francisco schools. So exposure to history and experiences of 
diverse populations like the Arab American experience is critical for all of our young people.  

The story of and realities of Palestine, as reported by Arab historians is a core part of this. It is not anti-
Semitic to include this history based on real, factual, historical reports. It tells a key part of the history of 
the region and the Arab diaspora, including persevering through human rights violations that have been 
verified by the United Nations. 

As someone who works at a well-known, and heralded Arab restaurant in San Francisco, Reem's 
California, I know that I would have benefited from Arab American studies growing up as a cultural 
competency and humility that would enhance my ability to do my job in San Francisco now. 

Best regards, 

Tim Huey
