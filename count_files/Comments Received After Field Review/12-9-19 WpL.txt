Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

While ethnic studies may be its own field of study with its own terminology etc. It completely lacks 
academic rigour, and is based upon ideology, not scientific methodology. Do not give this a leg to stand 
on. Do your homework and look at history for examples of what can result from adherence to political 
ideology.  
Stick to subjects that are derived from fields of study that strive for objective truth as much as possible 
and those that will actually educate students and not indoctrinate them.  
Thank you,
