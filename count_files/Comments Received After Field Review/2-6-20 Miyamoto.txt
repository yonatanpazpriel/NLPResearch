Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies – don’t shut out Arab-American experience 

Dear California Department of Education Jessica Costa, 

N.B.: I cannot envision any justification for omitting or under-representation of Arab 
American or Palestinians or any other ethnic group to the history and culture of ou 
California. The history of California is proof that Jews and Arabs can not only live 
alongside each other but flourish together. Let troubles in the Near East remain in the 
Levant, this is our California! 

I’m a constituent of yours and deeply concerned with reports that Arab American 
Studies may be cut from California’s Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), under 
the false premise of it not being within the four racialized groups of Ethnic Studies.  

The field’s leaders of color, including the Association of Asian American Studies, Asian 
American Studies Department Chairs, and the Save CA Ethnic Studies Coalition – are 
insisting Arab American Studies belongs in the curriculum, and that it remain.   

As is evident in the spirit of AB2016 legislation, the California Department of Education 
must respect communities of color, and have deference to Ethnic Studies professors 
and practitioners of color for this project. 

Efforts to undermine or water-down any critical components of the draft, and of Ethnic 
Studies as a field must be rejected.  

I know you are well-aware of the targeted attacks on Arabs and Muslims by the Trump 
administration, and the demonization of the struggle of migrants and people of color 
throughout the United States. As a sanctuary state, California should continue to be a 
counterweight against that trend – not serve as a stamp of approval. 

Sincerely, 
Hannah Miyamoto 
Oceanside, CA
