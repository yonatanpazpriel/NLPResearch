Subject: CA Ethnic Studies - California Tax Payer 

Ethnic Studies? i've sat back and watched as our school system has been teaching our children a 
form of socialist BS , My parents came here in the 60s legally worked hard and gave us 
everything to make us be part of a american country, i became a US Citizen as an adult, i worked 
hard ,I'm a Union Member , Retired but still pay taxes,capitalism is not racism , I'm tired of 
teachers instructing students how to be activist , my tax dollars should be teaching them 
Math,English,History without a distorted leftist view, 
I Oppes your Ethnic Studies and will make it a point to reject this type of indoctrination 
in our California School System , Only way that's going to happen is by My Vote to change 
this anti american views in our school and get this teacher to teach and not be social workers for 
our children.
