Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies - including Arab American Studies - vital to health 

Good afternoon, 

As a nurse and faculty of the Department of Nursing at CSU East Bay, I am advocating for the 
institutionalized presence of Arab American Studies - and Ethnic Studies at large - in our 
institutions of education. Knowledge of history and living legacies supports self-determination 
and demonstrates the importance of movement building. Both of these are vital to health and 
wellness. I advocate that any revisions made that would affect Arab American studies be made 
in collaboration and full partnership and transparency with Arab American scholars and 
practitioners of Ethnic Studies.  

Thank you for your time.
