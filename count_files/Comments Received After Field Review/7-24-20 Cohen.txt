Please stop 🛑 ESMCD’s “Arab American Studies Course Outline,” which promotes anti-Israel boycotts (BDS) and 
focuses on figures accused of anti-Semitism, such as Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour, Reps. Ilhan Omar 
(D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and deceased White House correspondent Helen Thomas.
