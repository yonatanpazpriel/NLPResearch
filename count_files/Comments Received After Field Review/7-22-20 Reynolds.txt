IQC Members: 

Please include Arab American studies, with the history and struggles of Palestinians, in 
the rubric of American Asian Studies curriculum in California.  Recently, our country has 
been moving away from racism in all aspects of our society.  Exclusion leads to racism, a 
step that must not be tolerated in our schoolsâ€™ curriculum.
