Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies – don’t shut out Arab-American experience 

Dear California Department of Education Jessica Costa, 

Before Prop 13 forced us to drop high school history electives I taught Mexican 
American history at Dixon High for 5 years.  It was a real eye-opener for everyone 
involved, including me, and the results were profound.  We NEVER had Anglo-Latino 
bullying at those days that I ever heard about and kids were very interested in each 
others's family histories. We were all immigrants and understood that.  
 Arab American Studies should NEVER be cut from California’s Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum (ESMC), under the false premise of it not being within the four racialized 
groups of Ethnic Studies.  

The field’s leaders of color, including the Association of Asian American Studies, Asian 
American Studies Department Chairs, and the Save CA Ethnic Studies Coalition – are 
insisting Arab American Studies belongs in the curriculum, and that it remain.   

As is evident in the spirit of AB2016 legislation, the California Department of Education 
must respect communities of color, and have deference to Ethnic Studies professors 
and practitioners of color for this project. 

Efforts to undermine or water-down any critical components of the draft, and of Ethnic 
Studies as a field must be rejected.  

I know you are well-aware of the targeted attacks on Arabs and Muslims by the Trump 
administration, and the demonization of the struggle of migrants and people of color 
throughout the United States. As a sanctuary state, California should continue to be a 
counterweight against that trend – not serve as a stamp of approval. 

Sincerely, 
Sherrill Futrell 
Davis, CA
