Subject: [EXTERNAL] Against antisemitism curriculum in California schools. 

Hi 

State Quality of Instruction, Soomin Chao, I write against the intention to introduce anti Jews / 
Israeli curriculum in California schools. This sort of indoctrination of young people can only 
happen in Arab/Muslim societies not in a country of freedom, that spouses freedom. Leaders in 
the USA of all political divide must never give radical Islam a foothold in public schools and the 
minds of young people. The spirit of America is the courageous spirit that resists all intimidation 
to do the bidding of the debased. Unfortunately the United Nations had succumbed to this 
Arab/Muslim manipulation, the USA must never be allowed to fail into this abyss else the entire 
world will slide into darkness. This if it happens will be playing the Arab Islam narrative of the 
Israeli Arab conflict propped up by american liberal state institutions of learning. You'd be doing 
the bidding of islamists if this is allowed to happen. Be wise. 

Best regards, 

Emeka Onyejietu.
