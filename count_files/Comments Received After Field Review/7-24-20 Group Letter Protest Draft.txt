Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school 
boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I â€œcannot support a curriculum that erases the American 
Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 
criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.
