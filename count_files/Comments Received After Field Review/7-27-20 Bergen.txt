Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab-American Studies is crucial! 

The Trump era has escalated the already serious environment of Islamophobia and anti-Arab 
racism in this country. It is therefore critical, and fundamental to the goal of Ethnic Studies, to 
include Arab-American studies as part of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. 

Sincerely, 

Dana Bergen
