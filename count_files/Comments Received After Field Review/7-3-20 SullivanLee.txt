Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of Arab American Studies 

To Whom it may concern:  

I am an instructor of Pacific Island Studies at a community college in California. I am also an alumni of SFSU. During 
my time at SFSU students fought passionately for the preservation and expansion of ethnic studies. Before this 
movement, there were not Pacific Island Studies at SFSU. Arab American studies and students who were part of 
the Palestinian student org on campus fought not only for their programs and Ethnic studies as a whole, but 
supported Pacific Islander students whole heartedly in the creation of our now growing program at SFSU. Arab 
American studies is vital during this time when Islamophobia is at an all time high. Palestinian studies cannot be 
left out of Arab American studies. Supporting Palestinian students and learning about their struggles changed my 
life and the history of SFSU, the birth place of Ethnic Studies, forever. Do not be complicit in the erasure of Arab 
American Histories and Futures. Our solitaries, struggles, and liberations are deeply and eternally linked. We are 
different but we fight the same fight.  

Sincerely, 
Amanda SullivanLee
