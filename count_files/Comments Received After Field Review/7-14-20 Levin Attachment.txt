Lesson Purpose and Overview:    

This two-part lesson introduces students to antisemitism and its manifestations through 
the lens of Middle Eastern Jews whose history of the past are defined by recent 
struggles of discrimination and prejudice in the United States. Students will analyze 
narratives, primary and secondary sources of the forgotten indigenous Jews of the 
Middle East and North Africa while contextualizing them within the larger framework of 
systems of power (economic, political, social) that manifested in the forms of forced 
migration, prejudice, and oppression. Their personal histories are defined by past and 
recent struggles of discrimination, prejudice and hate crimes in the United States. 

There is a dearth of scholarship on non-Ashkenazi Jews in America, including lack of 
clarity, scholarly investigation, and consistency in the categories used to describe them. 
Middle Eastern Jews have been referred to as Mizrahi, Sephardic Jews, Arab-Jews, or 
labeled with a sub-ethnic identifier such as Iranian or Moroccan. We have no clear 
demographic data on  the number of non-Ashkenazi Jews in America, but estimate that 
they comprise 10-20% of America’s total Jewish population.  

Takeaways:  

●  Antisemitism is prejudice and/or discrimination against Jews, individually or 

collectively, that can be based on hatred against Jews because of their religion, 
their ethnicity, ancestry, or group membership. It assumes that Jews share 
particular characteristics in common and think and act in special or “different” 
ways from other people. It manifests itself in a variety of forms – words, ideas 
and actions. It can involve bigotry, bullying, defamation, dehumanization, 
stereotyping, hate crime, acts of bias and scapegoating. Over its long history, 
antisemitism has been used to blame all kinds of evil on the Jews.

●  Historian Deborah Dwork explains: The move from anti-Judaism—against the 
religion—to antisemitism with this notion of "race" was only possible when 
Europeans conceived of the idea of race. And once they had conceived of the 
idea of race in the 19th century, Wilhelm Marr had the notion that Jews 
constituted a "race." And thus, antisemitism can be seen as a form of racism.

●  American Jews are not a homogenous group of white people; American Jews are 
an ethnically Middle Eastern people, comprising many unique communities from 
across the globe. First, “Jewish” is not synonymous with “white,” even though 
many American Jews are of European descent. Indigenous Jews were 
persecuted in their ancestral lands and continue to experience antisemitism and 
its manifestations in the United States.

Key Ethnic Studies Terms and Concepts: indigeneity, ethnicity, xenophobia, 
discrimination, prejudice, model minority, four I’s of oppression 

Prerequisite Skills and Knowledge: Students should have a basic understanding of 
systems of oppression and the four I’s of oppression – ideological, institutional, 
interpersonal and internalized to unpack the ways antisemitism has played out over 
time.  

Content and Language Objectives (Students will be able to…):  

1.  Develop an understanding of Middle Eastern Jews (who are also referred to as 
Arab Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, and Persian Jew) and differentiate 
the various identities, nationalities, and ethnicities that make up the American 
Jewish community. 

2.  Develop an understanding of the history of antisemitism in the Middle East and 

North Africa and its impact on Middle Eastern Jews, and identify how the 
American Jewish community, today, is impacted by prejudice and discrimination. 
3.  Gain a better understanding of root causes of antisemitism and how it manifests 
in various ways, such as religious, political, social, cultural, racial, and economic. 
4.  Learn about organization and advocacy to counteract antisemitism on a national 
and global level as it relates to indigenous people and their rights; and how to 
counteract institutional antisemitism as it impacts  Jewish religious institutions, 
and higher education cultural spheres . 

5.  Students will construct a visual, written and oral summary of antisemitism in the 

United States using multiple written and digital texts. 

Essential Questions: 

1.  Who is an American Jew? Who is a Middle Eastern Jew?  
2.  What is antisemitism? What are the causes of antisemitism? 

 
 
 
 
 
3.  What impact has antisemitism had on the American Jewish community? How has 

antisemitism been used to oppress, harm, discriminate American Jewish 
communities in the United States?  

4.  How can we learn from past and present antisemitism?  
5.  How have American Jews, specifically Middle Eastern-American Jews, 
responded to discriminatory/repressive conditions in U.S. history?  

6.  Why is it important to recognize the contributions of American Jews in fighting for 

human rights, etc.? 

Lesson Steps/Activities: 

PART ONE:  

1.  Introduce the lesson by posting the words “antisemitism” and “American Jews” to 

engage students in a discussion of discrimination that American Jews often 
encounter in the United States, both in the past and currently. 

2.  Engage the class by asking students what does antisemitism mean? What does 
antisemitism look like and how does it manifest in society? Before delving too 
deeply into discussion, ask the students to pair up with a student sitting next to 
them. Each pair is instructed to take five minutes to respond to the questions. 
Also ask the groups to list the various ethnic groups that comprise ‘American 
Jews’. 

3.  After about five minutes, allow each group to share what they discussed with the 
class. Write their responses on the board for antisemitism. Below the words 
“American Jews” ask students to list the various ethnic groups of Jews.  

a.  Sample Ethnic Groups (this list is in no way exhaustive) 

Ashkenazi/Eastern European Jews (German, Polish, Russian, etc.) 
Iranian Jews,  
Bukharin Jews, 
Yemenite Jews, 
North African Jews (Moroccan, Tunisian, Libyan, Algerian, Egypt),  
Turkish/Greek/Sephardic Jews, 
Latinx Jews, 
Levantine Jews (Iraqi, Syrian, Lebanese) 
Ethiopian Jews 

b.  Ask class if any of them are Jewish and from where? If they know of 

Jewish people from other countries? 

4.  Explain to students that the goal of the first part of this lesson is to expand their 
understanding of Jewish ethnic groups. They will be introduced to diverse 
communities of Middle Eastern Jews, who’ve been forgotten in global history and 
whose experiences of discrimination have taken place in the past and continue 
into the present. 

5.  Provide Handout A to the students 

a.  Definition of Antisemitism: Explain to students that while antisemitism is 
prejudice and/or discrimination against Jews, individually or collectively, 
that can be based on hatred against Jews because of their religion, their 

 
 
ethnicity, ancestry, or group membership. It assumes that Jews share 
particular characteristics in common and think and act in special or 
“different” ways from other people. It manifests itself in a variety of forms – 
words, ideas and actions. It can involve bigotry, bullying, defamation, 
stereotyping, hate crime, acts of bias and scapegoating. Over its long 
history, antisemitism has been used to blame all kinds of evil on the Jews. 
https://web.archive.org/web/20150318213350/http://www.brandeiscenter.c
om/images/uploads/articleuploads/trinity-Anti-Semitism.pdf 

b.  Read the Handout A with the students 

6.  Provide Handout B that offer questions about the 10- minute video they will 
watch about The Forgotten Refugees: Jews from the Middle East and North 
Africa. Pause the video at 2 minute intervals for students to complete the 
questions in the handout or write down any questions they may have.  

a.  The link to the video. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz9LPfB2ytM&feature=emb_title  
b.  If you have additional time, the 20 minute video provides more detail about 

the refugees experience.   https://vimeo.com/85087705 

7.  After watching the video, discuss the answers they wrote down and what they’ve 
learned.  How do these stories connect to other ethnic groups they’ve learned 
about? What would they like to know more about?  

a.  Explain to students that many of these Jews ended up in Israel. But, many 

have immigrated to countries around the world, the US having a 
population of an estimated 900,000 Jews who descend from North Africa 
and the Middle East.   

8.  For homework, show the JIMENA website. https://www.jimena.org/ Explain that 
JIMENA is an organization that represents the interests and heritage of Jews 
from North Africa and the Middle East . On the home page, JIMENA features 10 
Arab countries (Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Syria, 
Tunisia, Yemen). Under each country’s link are 3 sections: personal stories, 
Jewish history, and Culture.  

a.  Assign one country to a group of students to research and answer the 

following questions.  

i.  What stood out for you when reading someone’s personal story? 
Describe positive and negative experiences for these people. 

ii.  What did you learn about in the history section? What did 

discrimination look like? Can you identify systemic oppression?  

iii.  What were the impacts of antisemitism? 
iv.  Can you identify with stories, history, culture?  
v.  What other communities that we’ve learned about would identify 

with these narratives?  

b.  (The homework should be collected for assessment purposes) 

Lesson Steps/Activities: 

PART TWO:  

 
Note to Teacher: Before class begins print handouts for each station. If 
computers/internet is accessible, allow students to research additional information about 
their topic.  

1.  Follow up on the homework and/or discussion from Part One. What did you 
learn? What stood out to you? How is this similar/different to other forms of 
oppression and discrimination?  

2.  Remind the students that in Part One of this Lesson, they learned about 
antisemitism in the Middle East and North Africa in the past.  And that 
antisemitism has a long history around the world and in the United States and 
continues today.   

3.  Today, we are going to delve deeper into the experience of discrimination, hate, 
and violence against American Middle Eastern Jews (and all Jews) at present. In 
doing so, we will be working in three stations that highlight various forms of 
discrimination that manifest in different institutions. You will identify 
causes/reasons for antisemitism, use statistics, primary and secondary sources 
to understand the growing antisemitism in the U.S., you will read personal 
narratives throughout time to develop a more nuanced understanding of 
antisemitism, and draw connections from the past and present. You will also 
learn about ways communities are combating hatred. 

4.  Preparing the Three Stations:  

a.  Create a Title/Heading Placard for Each Station.  
b.  Print out a number of copies of all materials. Each station has 6-8 sources 

for students to review.  

c.  Make copies of the Handouts, which are graphic organizers that will allow 

students to track information.  Students will need to take notes in a 
notebook, since there is minimal space on the graphic organizer.  

d.  The graphic organizers have hyperlinks for all the sources. If computers 
are available at the stations, students can use them to read material or 
watch videos. The handouts can be emailed to students to continue their 
research at home with all links available.  

e.  Students can work individually or in pairs to research 1-2 sources on the 

graphic organizer. 

5.  Divide the students into groups of 3. Use one station to explain the columns of 
the graphic organizer, and providing a small amount of context for the sources 
(e.g., highlighting primary or secondary sources, identifying narratives, and 
including a review of secondary sources like credible news articles, scholarly 
research, interviews, statistics, informational videos, etc.).  

6.  Provide students with class time to work on the assignment. They should also 

have an opportunity to work on the assignment as homework.  

a.  For individual student assessments, each student is required to hand in 

their graphic organizer notes in the form of an essay.  

7.  After they complete the worksheets in their stations, the groups are tasked with 
working collaboratively to  present their station in an informative, organized and 
creative manner.  

8.  Provide students with poster boards for the presentation. (Students may also 
present it on PowerPoint or any other presentation tool the teacher deems 
appropriate or is available.) 

a.  Explain to students that they are required to work as a team to present the 

information in their stations in a creative manner (Note: Teacher can 
create a rubric for the project that included the required elements: 
personal stories, facts/statistics, as well as compare similarities and 
differences of other ethnic groups struggles as compared to the Jewish 
community of the US, and the connection to past and present 
antisemitism.   They are also required to present how various 
organizations in the Jewish community have resisted, responded, and 
advocated for Jewish rights and rights for all people)  

9.  The stations are:  

a.  Station 1: Iranian Jews of Los Angeles - A Story of Oppression and 

Resilience 

b.  Station 2: Antisemitism on College Campuses: Discrimination That 

Changes Over Time  

c.  Station 3: Protocols of the Elders of Zion and the Power of the Internet   

10. After each group presents, teachers should facilitate a discussion about the 
commonalities across institutions, the impact on Jews (and other minorities), 
ways to combat antisemitism. The following questions can be used:  

a.   How have Jews been affected by antisemitism? What impact does 

antisemitism have on others? 

b.  What is the meaning of “scapegoat”? What do people gain from 

scapegoating? 

c.  What is the effect of hateful images and speech? Do images and words 

reflect existing attitudes or create them? 

d.  How can individuals, groups, and governments combat the spread of and 

ill effects of misinformation? 

e.  How has antisemitism changed throughout history? What are some 
differences among religious, political, and racial anti-Semitism? 
f.  Why would political or religious leaders espouse antisemitic ideas? 
g.  How is antisemitism similar to or different from other forms of group 

hatred?  

h.  What can we do to make a difference? 

Lesson Modifications/Accommodations for Students with Special Needs:  

●  Consider writing the lesson steps and directives on PowerPoint slides or use 

other presentation software (e.g., google slides, Keynote, etc.) to better support 
visual learners. 

 
 
 
●  Teachers should regularly check for understanding, and reteach points if 

necessary, before moving on.  

●  Assignments can be differentiated by amount and type of modality that works 

best for each learning (auditory, visual, kinesthetic)  

●  Students should be utilized as resources to support peers in their learning. 

Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: 

●  Students will conduct research on antisemitism (past and present) for Mizrahi 
Jews in the United States. They will analyze personal narratives, articles and 
data for the cause and effects of discrimination.  

●  Students will respond in writing to a number of assignments to assess their 

knowledge.  

●  Students will write a 3-5 paragraph essay detailing the cause and effect of 

antisemitism across different institutions and linking them to past and present 
events.  

●  Students will present their research findings to their classmates and peers.

HANDOUT A: Definition of Antisemitism  

According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the world’s leading organization 
committed to stopping the defamation of the Jewish people,  

“Anti-Semitism refers to prejudice and/or discrimination against Jews as individuals and 
as a group. Anti-Semitism is based on stereotypes and myths that target Jews as a 
people, their religious practices and beliefs, and the Jewish State of Israel. Historically, 
what began as a conflict over religious beliefs evolved into a systematic policy of 
political, economic, and social isolation; exclusion, degradation and attempted 
annihilation. It did not begin in the Nazi era, nor did it end with the close of World War II. 
Its continuance over the millennia speaks to the power of scapegoating a group that is 
defined as the “other.”  
https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/education-outreach/Brief-
History-on-Anti-Semitism-A.pdf 

History  

In the late 1800s, many European and American scientists continued to divide 
humankind into smaller and smaller “races.” One of these was the “Semitic race,” which 
they used to categorize Jews. The term antisemitism was coined by German Wilhelm 
Marr, who published a pamphlet in 1878 titled “The Victory of Judaism over 
Germandom.” Filled with lies and myths about Jews, Marr’s pamphlet argued that Jews 
were more than a distinct “race.” They were dangerous and alien, intent on maliciously 
destroying German society.  

Historian Deborah Dwork explains, “The move from anti-Judaism—against the 
religion—to antisemitism with this notion of "race" was only possible when Europeans 
conceived of the idea of race. And once they had conceived of the idea of race in the 
19th century, Wilhelm Marr had the notion that Jews constituted a "race." And thus, 
antisemitism can be seen as a form of racism.”https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-
library/teaching-holocaust-and-human-behavior/roots-and-impact-antisemitis 

According to International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the only 
intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues, 
“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred 
toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward 
Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community 
institutions and religious facilities.” https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-
definition-antisemitism 

 
 
 
 
 
 
HANDOUT B:  The Forgotten Refugees: Discussion Questions 

A)  The Forgotten Refugees- Who are they?  

B)  What were some reasons for the dispossession of Jews from North Africa and 

the Middle East?  

C)  How did the Jews end up in Arab lands and Iran?  

D)  Why are they indigenous to these regions?  

E)  What changed for the Jews in the year 622?  

F)  What is a Dhimmi?  

G)  What did discrimination look like?  

In the 20th century indigenous Jewish communities throughout the Middle East and 
North Africa were severely oppressed and faced institutionalized discrimination and 
violence as a result of their faith. Government leaders throughout the region launched a 
systemic and deliberate effort to incite violence and fear that targeted Jewish 
communities and individuals.  Consequentially, nearly one million Jews from nine Arab 
countries and Iran were ethnically cleansed or forced to flee lands their ancestors lived 
in for over 2,500 years as a result of state-sanctioned, antisemitic persecution.  

UN House Resolution 242 stated that Jews fleeing Arab countries were ‘bona fide’ 
refugees, yet the international political community, the media, and North American 
academic, human rights, and mainstream cultural institutions have continuously ignored 
their experiences of dispossession and denationalization. Revisionist narratives of the 
Middle East, fail to address the fact that Israel provided safe haven to some 650,000 
Middle Eastern and North African Jewish refugees. The normalization of antisemitism in 
the Middle Eastern countries where Jews fled remains a problem in most countries in 
the region and few Middle Eastern Jews are willing to return to the countries they fled.  

As foremost sociologist of de-colonization Albert Memmi noted, “We would have liked to 
be Arab Jews. If we abandoned the idea, it is because over the centuries the Moslem 
Arabs systematically prevented its realization by their contempt and cruelty. It is now too 
late for us to become Arab Jews. Not only were the homes of Jews in Germany and 
Poland torn down, scattered to the four winds, demolished, but our homes as well.”

Station 1: Iranian Jews of Los Angeles - A Story of Oppression and Resilience  

DIRECTIONS FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT AND GROUP PRESENTATION 
1.  INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENT- Use the graphic organizer, below, to gather 

pertinent information from the articles in the station. Each student is required to 
take notes on 2 articles and write a 5-paragraph essay.  Your essay should
