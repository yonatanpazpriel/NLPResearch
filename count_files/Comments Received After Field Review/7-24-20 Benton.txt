To Whom It May Concern,  

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote 
the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the 
teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. 

I am disgusted that this curriculum isnâ€™t shut down and keeps getting put back on the table.  

In these times of racial unrest, we need to be teaching our children and young adults tolerance, empathy and understating of the 
struggles of ALL races and religions.  

I hope that our government and school boards see this for what it is....an attempt to turn young impressionable minds against the 
Jewish community.  

Do the right thing and reject ANY curriculum that aims to spread hatred towards ANY people.  

Thank you for your time 
Sharon
