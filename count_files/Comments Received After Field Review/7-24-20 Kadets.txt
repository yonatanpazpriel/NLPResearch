Subject: [EXTERNAL] Adoption of ESMCD 

To Whom It May Concern: 

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school 
boards. 

This is a controversial, radical curriculum that omits the Jewish perspective and promotes an anti-Israel agenda, 
the only democracy in the Middle East.  

The curriculum fails to address anti-Semitism and actually foments it by reinforcing negative stereotypes about 
Jews, singling out Israel for criticism and institutionalizes the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes as part of a 
regular curriculum.  

This is not only the American way to teach hate and stereotypes but the public schools are now being hijacked by 
an agenda to convert America to anti semitism and jew hatred and an agenda to destroy Israel, the state that was 
the only beacon of hope for those surviving the horrific death camps of Europe and Americas ally.  

I kindly ask you to reverse this tragedy of passing this curriculum.  

Sincerely 

Cat Kay
