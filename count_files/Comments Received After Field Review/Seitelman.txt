To Members of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum Development Committee et. al,  

I urge you to create a curriculum that carefully explores the past and present history of ethnic groups 
without using it as a forum to advance political agendas and sow divisiveness.  

Give everyone a seat at the table to promote understanding, civility, sensitivity, and a shared purpose in 
finding ways to work together.  

Sincerely,  

Judy Seitelman
