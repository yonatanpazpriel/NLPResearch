Subject: [EXTERNAL] In Favor of Ethnic Studies 

Dear CDE: 

I write to express my support, as a teacher and parent, for including Ethnic Studies in curricula for all 
California schools. We do students a disservice when we ignore (or allow schools to ignore) these 
important histories and perspectives.
