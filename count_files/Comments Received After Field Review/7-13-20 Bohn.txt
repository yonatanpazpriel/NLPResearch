INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies. 

Include Arab American studies within the rubric of Asian American studies. 
In this era of Islamophobia and xenophobia, itâ€™s also important to include West Asian American experiences in the 
ESMC. 
The history and current struggles in Palestine should  be included. 
It is not antisemitic to defend human rights, and include Palestinian history and current movements in ethnic 
studies. 
Revisions that affect Arab American studies should be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and 
Ethnic Studies practitioners.  

Thank you. Sincerely,  
Diana Bohn
