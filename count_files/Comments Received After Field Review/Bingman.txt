To the California State Board of Education, State Superintendent of Public 
Instruction Tony Thurmond,  

The proposed California ethnic studies curriculum is sick and twisted. It has 
nothing to help our children become aware of there culture. I do not wish to 
have this course offered, used as a graduation requirement or used in the 
future as a guide to be used across the nation. 
This is not what we send our kids to school to learn. It does not promote 
learning because it is anti-Semitic, is anti-captialism and Anti-American. It 
promotes Cop killers who have fled to Cuba, PLO members, Black Panther 
members. It does not prepare our children to become critical thinkers and 
contributors to the great nation that we have the privilege to live in. 
I certainly hope that our governor who signed to the law to create this 
curriculum, Tony Thurmond and Katie Porter are taking action to protect the 
future of our Great State of California, the United States of America and 
most importantly, our children. 

Thank you, 

Celeste Bingman
