Dear President Darling-Hammond, 

We are 94 civil rights, human rights, religious and education organizations representing hundred of thousands 
of members and supporters, many of them residents of California.  

Most of our organizations were signatories on a 8/7/19 letter to IQC Chairperson Chao. Our letter noted that 
although our groups were deeply concerned about the original draft curriculum’s omission of information 
about American Jews and anti-Semitism, its use of classic anti-Semitic tropes and its blatant anti-Israel bias, 
we viewed these problems with the curriculum’s content as symptoms of a much larger and far more serious 
problem affecting not only Jewish students but all students in the state. Our key issue was the fact that its 
drafters were given free rein to use this model curriculum as a tool for political indoctrination in the first place. 
We stated that merely revising or re-writing the curriculum would be insufficient; it would treat the symptoms 
without curing the underlying illness. That is why in our original letter we urged the establishment of 
safeguards to ensure that this model curriculum, and all state-sponsored curricula and other instructional 
materials, may never be hijacked as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against 
any race, religion, group or individual.  

We were therefore pleased to see that in your recent public statement you noted that a model curriculum 
should be “free of bias” and suggested that this is one of the areas in which the current draft model curriculum 
"falls short and needs to be substantially redesigned." Now that the period for public comments has ended and 
the hard work of overhauling the model curriculum has begun, we believe it is critically important that you 
immediately amend the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines to include a warning that those involved 
with the drafting of the curriculum may not use it as a tool for political indoctrination. If this is not possible, 
we ask that you immediately issue a public statement affirming that the Board of Education will ensure that the 
model curriculum it approves in March 2020 will be free of political indoctrination and will not promote hatred 
or incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.  

Either of these steps would go a long way towards regaining the public's trust that the initial draft model 
curriculum has seriously eroded to date. 

Thank you,
