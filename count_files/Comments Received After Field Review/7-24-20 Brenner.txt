Please do not permit the ESMCD proposal to go into effect. Jewish students all across America are facing horrific 
unprecedented Anti-semitism on college campuses.  This proposal will do further damage by indoctrinating 
younger children with a dishonest and heavily biased view of the Mideast, Jewish history and Jews in general. This 
is pretty scary. 
Please prevent this happening because now is the time for understanding rather than perpetuating hate. Enough is 
enough.
