Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Our country is comprised of many cultures.  It is vital that all students from K-12 have Ethnic Studies in order for 
them to understand and appreciate our shared histories and discern truth from fiction.  It is entirely appropriate to 
have Arab American studies taught within Asian American studies for proper historical context.  It is 
unconscionable not to include Arab American scholars in the revision process, as these scholars have the necessary 
expertise to provide the most accurate history into such revisions.  Studentâ€™s need to know their own cultural 
history within the context of our American history. Such knowledge not only empowers students to have a fuller 
and more successful lives but strengthens our society as well.  The inclusion in ethnic studies of Palestinian history, 
human rights, and current events in the region is not antisemitic when told truthfully.  These are difficult subjects 
to address but can be if grounded in truth.  Our young people will face many complex issues in life.  A well-sourced, 
accurate, truthful history will allow them to engage in the critical thinking, have the discussions, and, hopefully, 
make good decisions.
