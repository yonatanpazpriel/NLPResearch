Subject: [EXTERNAL] Retain Arab American Studies 

Hello, My name is Julie Kanoff, a CSUS alumna with my MA in Communication Studies. I am writing to 
request Arab American Studies be retained under the rubric of Asian Studies in the CSUS curricula, along 
with teaching the truth about the current state of affairs in Palestine. In a time such as the one we find 
ourselves in at present, teaching the truth in collaboration with Arab scholars and Ethnic Studies 
practitioners is of even greater importance. We are a nation ugly in our ignorance. Eliminating these 
courses does a huge disservice to our students and the world at large and is reminiscent of the way the 
“Indian Problem” was addressed by educators in past centuries by fully ignoring the over 2,000 
indigenous tribes colonized and enslaved in order to found these United States, and mischaracterizing 
them as savages and less than human. Do we in these supposedly more enlightened times want to go 
down that path? Now, is the time to let the truth of all people be told. Let perpetrators be known for 
perpetration never mind their religious position. Teaching the facts about Palestine is in no way anti-
Semitic, it is pro-humanity, and pro-truth. Our education system in California would be failing our 
students and our poor struggling planet if we eliminated another set of courses that allow for a more 
rounded education and tools for critical thinking. Do not let these voices be silenced. Engage the Arab 
American scholars in the conversation and allow these courses to continue. We need people who 
understand the world and the greater context and complexity of that world through a solid higher 
education obtained in California. Let us lead the way forward.  Thank you - Julie Kanoff
