Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Hello, 

For almost a year, teachers, activists, students, and community members have been 
struggling to convince the CA Board of Education to keep the CA Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum intact, including the proposed Arab American studies curriculum. It's time to 
heed our call.  

As a third-generation Syrian American, I'm tired of feeling invisible or demonized, and I 
don't want this for young people. We want to be included with accurate portrayals that 
reflect our lived history and realities. 

Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners have given this a lot of 
thought, and believe Arab American studies fall within the rubric of Asian American 
studies. We are from Southwest Asia. During a time when Islamophobia and 
xenophobia are writing us out of visibility except through a racist lens, we all need to 
stand for this. 

I need to be explicit in stating that inclusion on its own is not enough. Curricula must 
include the history and current struggles of Palestinians, from the point of view of 
Palestinians. We can't let fear of being called anti-Semitic stop us from standing for 
human rights for all. Many Jewish people can distinguish between anti-Semitism and 
critique of Israel. Listen to them. Listen to the community of scholars reaching out to 
you. Listen to me. It's time for change. 

Thank you for your time. 

Mary Salome
