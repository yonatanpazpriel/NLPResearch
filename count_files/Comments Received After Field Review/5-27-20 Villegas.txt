Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support to Save Ethnic Studies @ OUSD! 

Dear Oakland Board Members, 

I urge you to put “Students First” by supporting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum led by 
scholars of color from across California. Oakland is exactly the kind of city that should stand up 
for our underrepresented communities. 

Ethnic Studies has always been about empowering students of color who are marginalized and 
minimized by our curriculum.  We need to bring this conversation back to the focus of Students 
First, one of our Core OUSD Values.  Our white students greatly benefit from having these 
critical conversations about race, so that all Oaklanders can build skills to navigate our society 
and build stronger communities and neighborhoods. 

Pacific Islander/Arab American/Central American Studies is important to me because they are 
my friends. They are my community. We should not be having to fight for the right to learn about 
the people we see and care about. We want to learn and understand their history and vice 
versa. Ethnic studies brings our community closer in appreciating what we’ve been through and 
celebrating the success together. We want curriculum that is relevant to our lives and 
experiences. 

This controversy is a perfect example of why we need Ethnic Studies and why we must have 
these conversations to address racial tensions in our community, so that we can move toward 
healing, understanding, and solidarity across all of our cultures. 

Please vote YES, thank you!
