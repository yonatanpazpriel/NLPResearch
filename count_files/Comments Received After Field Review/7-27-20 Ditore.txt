Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

And just what the HELL is so bad about kids 
learning things about other cultures? Are they 
afraid knowledge of other peoples might 
humanize them in the minds of young peopls, 
making it that much harder to de-humanize 
them in racist national and local policies?  
Yeah? WELL, TOO FUCKING BAD. This 
hokey "divide and conquer" crap AIN'T  
WORKING ANY MORE. They're just too 
damn late to ramp up their fascism with the 
whole nation burning now to DESTROY IT. 
Bet that worries the hell out of 'em too. 

Sincerely, 
Steve Ditore
