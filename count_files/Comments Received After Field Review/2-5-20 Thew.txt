It's very disappointing that one group is trying to force removal of another group from the 
curriculum.  That is not how inclusivity works, or freedom of speech.  Please don't allow yourselves to be 
bullied by zealots and bigots.  California is a giant melting pot, and all pot ingredients matter. 

Thank you,
