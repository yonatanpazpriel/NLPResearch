Subject: [EXTERNAL] Antisemitism in proposed California Ethnic Studies program 

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by 
California school boards. I strongly oppose a curriculum that erases the American Jewish 
experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, uses anti-
zionism as a back-door for antisemitism, and institutionalizes the teaching of anti-Semitic 
stereotypes in our public schools. The people who are trying to put this garbage in the ethnic 
studies curriculum should be required to apologize, be dismissed, or permanently banned from 
any committees that influence the curriculum. It is not only that anti-black bias matters but 
antisemetic bias is just as bad and more dangerous. 

Regards,
