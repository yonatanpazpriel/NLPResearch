Your curriculum should never include an assault on our Constitution, the lie that capitalism is racist, glorifying cop 
killers, antisemitism, boycotting Jews or Conservatives, supporting Islamic terrorists, censorship, or supporting racial 
division in our country. School curriculum should always promote allegiance to our country, assimilation into our 
culture/values, racial unity, and legal entry into our country. Americans are waking up to the dangerous indoctrination 
of our children and will strongly oppose it.
