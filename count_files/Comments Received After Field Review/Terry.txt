To Whom it May Concern: 
Pursuant to your request for feedback regarding of proposed curriculum: 
The BDS movement is at this point not being objective when educating CA children. You are 
pushing political values. Education should teach our children the basic fundamentals, for a well 
rounded education. 

CA should focus on educating children instead of promoting a social justice agenda and 
promoting an agenda for them. Shouldn't they be taught to think on their own and become 
independent thinkers? 

I would also like to address capitalism. Capitalism is the foundation of America. It is not racist. 
Is this an agenda item that CA proposed curriculum is being politicalized. This is a form of 
power and attention being projected and demonized. Doesn't capitalism paying for public school 
systems. I know my tax dollars pay for the school system. That leads my to my final statement 
around capitalism and "math" with the reference that math is racism. I am not sure how those 
two things go together. Math is not a liberal perspective view point. Math does not further white 
suprematist. Math is a logical discipline. Kids should learn to think and solve complex problems. 

I hope that CA will move its school curriculum to educate all people, including the ones that are 
fleeing from socialism and drug cartels to get the best education in America. 

Best regards
