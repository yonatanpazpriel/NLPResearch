Hello,  

  I am a long time â€˜California resident, father, and former teacher who strongly urges you to maintain the Ethnic 
Studies program, in the curriculum and expand it to include Arab Studies.The Middle East has been so devastated 
by wars and conflict for many years, which has produced millions of refugees, many of whom have assimilated into 
other countries.The social, psychological, and economic effects on these immigrants and their families have many 
consequences and it is so important for students of their families two be able to learn about their own culture, and 
history,. Having Arab studies available will also help all students to have a better understanding of each others 
cultures, and the events unfolding in the middle East today. This better understanding and appreciation can lead 
to  
Wiser policies and peace. Everyone deserves to have their culture acknowledged and respected. WE all thrive on 
this diversity and it should be reflected in the curriculum 

Thank you
