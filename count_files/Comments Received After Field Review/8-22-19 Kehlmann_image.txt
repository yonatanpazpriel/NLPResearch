Dear Sir:

I'd like to lend a strong word of support for slowing down the current process of
developing an Ethnic Studies program for California schools. It’s too important an
educational tool to end up with a mishmash of compromises in order to satisfy
everyone quickly.

Educators should encourage students to widen the lens of their global awareness.
Prejudice, with the cruelties and injustices that follow, are inherent in human
society and should be treated as such in the curriculum. There are those based on
sex, age, religion and class as well as ancestry and phenotypes.

The aim of the educational system should never be to directly promote political
activism. In the 1930’s the Germans used their schools to indoctrinate a
generation.... with a disastrous result for all of us.

Perhaps we should rename the course Multi-Cultural Studies?
