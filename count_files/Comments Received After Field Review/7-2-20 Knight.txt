Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include non-Jewish Semites such as Arabs , Palestinians , Druz, in your ethnic 
studies curricula. 

In Biblical legends, Noah fathered Shem. Ham, and Japheth, or Semites (populationsof the eastern Mediterranean 
and Arabia,) Hamites (Egyptians and other Africans), and Cretans, Greeks, And other Europeans. Those we now call 
Jews started splitting off in the stories about Abraham, although Hagar, his concubine, and Ishmael, his son, were 
Part of the family.  It wasn’t until much later, after Moses, that there was a distinction between the Semites who 
continued living in Abraham’s territory and those who had moved into and then out of Egypt.  Now, real history 
may have different stories and facts, but the ways in which one people, one ethnic group, became warring tribes is 
worth Studying.  This is also relevant to the divisions between different groups of European immigrants to this 
country, with consequences ranging from Norwegian/blonde jokes to civil war and threats of Resurgent war.  So 
please do not erase any ethnic groups from your ethnic studies program.  We all, everywhere in the world, have 
much to learn from their interactions, whether successful or failed.
