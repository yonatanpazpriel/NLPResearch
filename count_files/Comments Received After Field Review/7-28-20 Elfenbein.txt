Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Americans cannot be excluded from Ethnic Studies. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I am writing as a scholar and educator to urge you to uphold Ethnic Studies and to preserve the 
inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.  

The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum offers a way of engaging California's diverse student body 
in global history and world literature. Arab Americans are a significant group of Californians, 
just as the Arab contribution to global history and culture deserves recognition. 

According to a survey conducted by Arab Youth Organizing (AYO), more than 66% of students 
surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the 
internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. 

Sincerely, 
Madeleine Elfenbein
