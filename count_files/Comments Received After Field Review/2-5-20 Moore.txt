Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Dear Madam/Sir, 

As a mother of two LAUSD students, I oppose the ethnic studies curriculum. Children 
are overwhelmed already and crushed with work and homework and this curriculum will 
not only add volume of study but also can divide and politicize them.  

Please reconsider 
Kind regards
