Subject: [EXTERNAL] include Arab-Am studies in CA ethnic studies curriculum 

I write to you as a retired middle school teacher and a Jew to strongly encourage you to include 
Arab-American studies as part of the state ethnic studies curriculum. 
   From my personal experience teaching many ESL students, I know how important it is for their 
self-esteem to see themselves as part of the curriculum and, from my personal experience as a 
Jew, I recognize how much all of us need to learn about each other so that we are 
knowledgeable and empathetic, which will help us all live together in respect and peace. 
   Post 9/11 and given the horrific policies of the Trump administration, it is of the utmost 
importance that Arab-Americans, including Palestinians and Asians, be supported and included. 
  I hope you will support and encourage human rights for all by including Arab-American 
studies within the California ESMC. 
   Sincerely, 
    Karen Platt, Albany CA
