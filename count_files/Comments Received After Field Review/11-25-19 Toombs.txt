RE: 

Ethnic Studies Focus Groups 

Dear Superintendent Thurmond: 

On  behalf of the  California  Faculty  Association  (CFA),  we  write  to express  our concern  with  regard  to  the 
exclusion  of higher education  faculty from  ethnic study focus  groups.  CFA  represents  over 29,000 faculty, 
including tenure-track professors,  lecturers, librarians, counselors, and  coaches  from  all  23  campuses of the 
California State University (CSU)  system, which serves more than 470,000 students in the State of California. 

On  September  16,  2019,  the  California  Department  of Education  (COE)  and  the  California  State  Board  of 
Education (CSBE)  announced that they would do a series of focus groups on  ethnic studies curriculum with a 
various groups, including "experts in the field of Ethnic Studies."  Two weeks ago,  we learned that COE  hired 
a third  party to organize the focus  groups and  a nomination form  was  disseminated.  The  form  specifically 
stated that members of the Ethnic Studies Advisory Committee would be  part of the focus groups.  There are 
four higher education members that are  part of the Ethnic Studies Advisory Committee. 

We  are  concerned  that the  latest  iteration  of the  nomination  form  indicates  that  only  middle  school  and 
secondary teachers and administrators would be  in the focus groups.  This leaves out higher education ethnic 
study experts that work in  teacher preparation.  We  are  concerned about the exclusion of higher education 
faculty and the inclusion of administrators who do not teach nor engage in the process of teacher preparation 
or curriculum development. 

We urge you to work with the CSBE to ensure higher education faculty, specifically the four higher education 
members of the Ethnic Studies Advisory Committee, are  included  in the focus groups.  Should  you  have  any 
questions regarding this letter, please contact Mario Guerrero, CFA's Legislative Director at 916-441-4848, or 
mguerrero@calfac.org. 

Sincerely, 

Charles Toombs,  PhD
