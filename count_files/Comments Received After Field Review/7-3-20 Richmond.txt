Subject: [EXTERNAL] offering Arab American studies 

 Arab American Studies is a critical component of Ethnic Studies! And Palestine is a 
critical component of Arab American studies! 

Don't shortchange our students by getting political - please offer these classes so we 
can have an informed public.  This is crucial to our future. 

Sincerely, 
Lonna Richmond
