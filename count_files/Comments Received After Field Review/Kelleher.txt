To whom it concerns, 
I strongly oppose the adoption of the current ethnic studies curriculum for California school 
children. This program only drives the radical left agenda and pushes beliefs that are anti-
American. Vis-a-vis that capitalism is racism and is a type of white supremacy. I will not tolerate 
the adoption of this radical curriculum in my childâ€™s school or any school in California. DO NOT 
ADOPT THIS CURRICULUM!
