Subject: [EXTERNAL] Regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Hello School Board Members, 

I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft.  Your 
support would mean the world to me. My family and I have lived in Foster City for many 
years. We have never seen adequate representation of the narratives of people of color in 
our textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the community we live in.  

Your resolution is a moving step for social justice.  From the bottom of my heart: Please 
vote to support this!
