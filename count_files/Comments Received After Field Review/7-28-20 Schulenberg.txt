Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Americans cannot be excluded from Ethnic Studies. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I graduated from Humboldt State University. 

I strongly support the Ethnic Studies requirement. I am concerned, however, that one may be 
adopted which is not inclusive of Muslim and Arab Americans. 

An Ethnic Studies program which neglects the value of our Muslim and Arab citizens would be a 
travesty. Further, any effort to conflate legitimate support for Palestine with anti-Semitism is an 
affront to all who seek to limit bias and discrimination. 

Support the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 
Margaret Schulenberg
