Hello Trustees,  

 OFFICE OF THE CITY COUNCIL 
 CITY OF DALY CITY 
 333 â€“ 90TH STREET 
 DALY CITY, CA  94015-1895 

As a fellow elective official, I write this letter to urge you to support the model Ethnic Studies 
curriculum for the South San Francisco Unified School District (SSFUSD). I come from an Ethnic 
Studies background that allowed me to learn about my history, identity, and how it has informed my 
purpose to serve my community. Ethnic Studies gave me a lens to understand my identity of being a 
child of Filipino immigrants; the legacy of labor organizers; the understanding of how racism, gender 
and sexuality, and class affects our society. I have mentored thousands of students to become Ethnic 
Studies teachers and leaders in the Bay Area and abroad over the past two decades through my 
organization, the Pin@y Educational Partnerships (PEP) and as an Instructor at Skyline College. It 
has widened my scope to serve communities beyond a charity standpoint, but to cultivate a 
community to become agents of change. 

You are in place of leadership to take the historical step to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. 
Ethnic Studies has transformed the lives of my community, my students, and family to understand 
that they are part of the curriculum and are authors of history. On February 27, 2020, I strongly 
endorsed the passage of Ethnic Studies in my home district, Jefferson Elementary School District 
(JESD) in Daly City, CA. Our board unanimously passed a resolution to become the first elementary 
and middle school district to implement Ethnic Studies in the nation. I hope you will join us, and the 
growing list of districts in CA, to pass the model Ethnic Studies curriculum for your community. 

Sincerely, 

Dr. Roderick Daus-Magbual 
Council Member 
City of Daly City
