Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum study 

Dear Mr. Chao, 
I pray you will not put a curriculum study in place as it is at the moment.  I'm addressing the fact 
that, as I understand,  there is anti-semitism not discussed, but taught; that Israel is being 
criticized as a nation; that Jews are being spoken or taught of in a stereo-typical way.  Mr. Chao, 
the Jewish people have been forerunners in much of modern medicine, technology, caring for 
any Palestinians that are wounded.  For all that, they have been harrassed, wounded or killed, 
made fun of, etc.  Please include in your curriculum the positive side of Israel and the Jewish 
people. 
Thank you for reading.  Sincerely, 
Mary M. Dekkers
