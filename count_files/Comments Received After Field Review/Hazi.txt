I am extremely concerned by the proposed curriculum for the required “Ethnic Studies Program” in public high 
schools. The fact that Jews are omitted as an ethnic group, especially in these times when Jews and other ethnic 
minorities are being singled out, is unconscionable. The curriculum also presents a highly biased view of the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict, a classic sign of the "new anti-semitism" which is just an old hatred disguised amidst anti-Israel 
views.  
Not long ago in Charlottesville, white nationalists shouted "Jews will not replace us" as a protester was killed. The 
Poway synagogue shooting this year killed 11 Jews and was the most deadly anti-semitic attack in U.S. history. 
Moreover, the virulent and anti-semitic tropes found in the curriculum as it deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
are deplorable. The "information" presented about the conflict is inaccurate and misleading. I am an immigrant and do 
not support many of the policies of my native government, Argentina. However, singling out Argentina for specific 
censure amid hundreds of countries in the world would be racist. In the same way, singling Israel and its people for 
censure because of its government's policies is anti-semitic and racist. 
As a taxpayer and active voter I demand that an investigation be made as to the motivations behind the curriculum 
and its singularly biased viewpoint.
