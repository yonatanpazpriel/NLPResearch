Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment: Arab American Studies should be included 

Hello IQC, 

As an eighteen year veteran high school social studies teacher, I implore 
you to stand up to conservative interests that are trying to exclude Muslim 
and Palestinian interests from the ethnic studies curriculum.  Our Muslim 
students do not have powerful lobbies to fight for them, so I encourage 
you to justly support their interests.  Many Muslims face discrimination 
already.  Arab-Americans deserve a voice! 

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict, while controversial, is significant in 
understanding the history of the Middle East and the War on 
Terror.  Because the topic is dominated by biased information, it is even 
more important that objective classrooms explore the different 
perspectives.  It is not Anti-Semitic to consider the actions of Israel and the 
Palestinians. 

Please include Arab American perspectives, including on Palestine in the 
Asian American framework.  Thank you, 

Charles Haws
