Subject: [EXTERNAL] Hate in a public school curriculum 

I am a social studies teacher from another state. I am appalled that the California educational system is being used 
as an accessory to the hate mongering against Jews that is becoming an issue in the United States. If someone 
came to ask for anti-black anti-Muslim anti-Latino anti-gay or lesbian studies, you would all be up in arms. There is 
a saying that those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it. You might want to pick a history 
book on World War II and see what happened to the Nazis in general and Hitler in specific. This past week there 
was a trial in Germany of a concentration camp guard. It may be 75years later, but no one is safe from 
punishment. I feel sorry for you if you canâ€™t learn from that history  Please stop this obscenity from going forward.
