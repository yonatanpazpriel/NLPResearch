Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American Studies in CA 

Dear Ethnic Studies of California, 

I'm a community college student at Chabot College and I want to say that I'm in support to 
include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I support the ESMC, including 
Arab American studies. I think ethnic studies is important because it's crucial to remember the 
past. I don't think is right for scholars who work hard every day of their lives for their voices to 
be heard and then the system ignores them. I think Arab American scholars should be allowed 
to speak at the revision process because they all have a voice. I understand that you have many 
supporters including the National Association of Asian American Studies, Arab American Studies 
Association, the Third World Liberation Front Veterans. I hope more people step forward and 
support you. Thank you. 

From, 
Troy A. Gonzales
