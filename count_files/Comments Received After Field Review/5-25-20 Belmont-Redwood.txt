direction to foster global citizenship; and  

WHEREAS, in 2018, the Belmont-Redwood Shores School District adopted the History Alive! Instructional

the global citizenship goal for students to respect, understand, and engage others within and beyond their 
own experience; and  

WHEREAS, students from a variety and mixture of ethnic and racial backgrounds make up approximately 61%

home language other than English; and 

WHEREAS, the Belmont-Redwood Shores School District has a commitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity;

WHEREAS, CA Education Code Section 51204.5 prescribes the inclusion of the legacies of ethnic and cultural

WHEREAS, Ethnic Studies originated in this country during the Civil Rights and Third World Liberation Front

world, including those living with oppression, systemic racism and who are denied the right to live with dignity 
and freedom; and 

WHEREAS, CA AB2016 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is currently in process at the California
