Subject: [EXTERNAL] Just one sided perspective on the Israel/Palestinian Perspective 

To Whom It May Concern, 

I am deeply concerned and shocked at the curriculum you are proposing concerning Israel and BDS.  

I thought that the purpose of education was to teach our children facts and for them to learn to think, doubt, and 
debate.  

Why have you decided to take the side of the Palestinians? Why do you justify BDS, whose purpose is only to 
destroy Israel while promoting lies, hate and division? 
Why do you use the vitriol of BDS? Why do you use the word apartheid? Have any of you been to Israel? Have you 
seen how Arabs ( many in the Knesset), Muslims, Africans, live in peace? 

Why did you not include in the curriculum how Israel gave back land in 1967, how she was surrounded by enemies 
and attacked, how Almost every day there are missiles attacking Israelâ€™s civilians, how children are used as suicide 
bombers, and pay to slay is a known tactic? 

Why do you use an anti Israel 
Poem which insinuates the Jews control the media? 

I am a docent at the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust. I show the students the books that young German 
students read about Jews, in an effort to show them how hate is created. Your curriculum reminds me of these 
books. 

My grandchildren are in the LA city school system. I do not want them to be taught only one side. I do not want 
them to be part of the new Antisemitism.  

I beg you to reconsider and please contact me if you wish to discuss my perspective.  

Thank you for your time and I do trust you will reconsider the curriculum, 

Sincerely, 
Linda Nacif
