To Whom It May Concern: 

Please â€” what our world needs more than ever before is acceptance and welcoming of others, those who are 
different from us. What makes us rich as a society is our diversity of culture and history. 

I urge you strongly to include Arab American studies in the curricula for our children and young people. As a 
former high school teacher in San Francisco, I cannot emphasize strongly enough the importance of preparing the 
next generation who will live in a more diverse world than we have now. Protect their right to know the history of 
all peoples represented in the school system, including Palestinians and other minorities. After all, is it not the 
truth that will set us free and forge the way ahead to global justice and peace? There are plenty of knowledgable 
and wise people who are expert in these areas that can help you set up a curriculum that we can all be proud of. 

Thank you.
