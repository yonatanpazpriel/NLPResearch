Chair of the California Instructional Quality Commission Soomin Chao: 

Have you seen this? 

https://unitedwithisrael.org/act-now-demand-california-schools-reject-radical-anti-israel-
curriculum/ 

Can we please not have anti-Semitism, or anti-Semitism masquerading as BDS or anything else, being 
taught in schools?  Our schools should be better than this. 

Thank you for your attention.
