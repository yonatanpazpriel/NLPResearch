I agree with Page 1 as it clearly indicates that Arabs and Pacific Islanders are marginalized communities that haven't been represented 
in courses in k-12. 
Page 233// Arab and Arab American have dealth with xenophobia and discrimination - including the studies in the curriculum will allow student to feel welcome 
in public schools.
