Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not remove Arab Americans from our states curriculum 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

This message is to urge you to include Arab American studies in the Asian American studies 
curriculum.  

Ethnic Studies in K-12 curriculum is a great way for students to build empathy, understanding, 
and respect for each other. 

Sincerely, 
dorian sapiens
