Dear School Board Members, 

I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft written by teachers 
and scholars from across California. Your support would mean the world to me. I am a fourth 
generation Oaklander and attended Oakland public schools. Unfortunately, I did not learn this 
important history until college and missed out on having a more in-depth understanding of 
myself, my community and the world around me. Oakland is exactly the kind of city that should 
stand up for our underrepresented communities. 

Ethnic Studies has always been about empowering students of color who are marginalized and 
minimized by our curriculum. We need to bring this conversation back to the focus of Students 
First, one of our Core OUSD Values. White students like me greatly benefit from having these 
critical conversations about race, so that all Oaklanders can build skills to navigate our society 
and build stronger communities and neighborhoods. 

Ethnic Studies, and especially hearing the range of experiences and stories within the different 
ethnic identities, is important to me because without it we do not have the deep and rich 
historical and cultural understanding of our country. And without that, we are doomed to a cycle 
of inequity and disconnection as human beings.  

This controversy is a perfect example of why we must have these conversations to address 
racial tensions in our community, so that we can move toward healing, understanding, and 
solidarity across all of our cultures. 

Please vote YES, thank you!
