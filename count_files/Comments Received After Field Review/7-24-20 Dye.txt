Ethnic studies need to include the nation of Israel and their fight to keep the land that was given to them by God 
and for which they have been forced to fight for all these years later. It would be shameful to bring racism into 
your choice of who to include. Isn’t the point for all nations to be celebrated and not demeaned!   I hope to see a 
change in this situation as a taxpayer who wants diversity for all...not just those YOU choose.  That’s called 
racism!  Thank you. Connie Dye, Carlsbad, Ca.  

The Lord Is my strength and my shield; I will trust in Him because He my Helper. My heart is content and I will give 
thanks to him no matter what! From Psalm 28:7
