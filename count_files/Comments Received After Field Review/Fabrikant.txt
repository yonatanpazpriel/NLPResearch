I'm very upset about the new Ethics Studies Curriculum you are reviewing. As a Jew (and an educator in the San 
Diego Unified School District and now the Grossmont Union High School District for over 40 years), I've seen first- 
hand how curriculum like this effects students. Please do your research about the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, 
Sanctions) movement.  

What concerns me is that the curriculum only mentions Jews in passing. There is not one lesson about the Jewish 
community. Are you aware of this data: nationally, the Anti-Defamation League released their annual audit of anti-
semitic incidents for 2018, which shows anti-semitic incidents in California were up 27%, marking a 3rd straight year 
of an increase of such incidents. Consequently with antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people a 
major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum. In light of the shooting at the Chabad 
Synagogue in Poway recently, this 1 sided curriculum, is only giving students the opportunity to see what is 
happening in the Middle East through one lens, that of the BDS movement.  

Please reconsider adopting this one-side, clearly anti-semitic curriculum. 

Sincerely, 

Ellen Fabrikant
