Dear Aimee, 

I'm a constituent in your district. I live in the Ivy Hill neighborhood in Oakland.  

As a Jewish resident, I feel it is important to voice my strong support of the Ethnic Studies 
curriculum for OUSD. I didn't encounter ethnic studies coursework until college, and though I 
am extremely grateful for those important discussions about race, they would have been even 
more impactful earlier on. It's critical that OUSD white students engage in conversations of race 
and white supremacy. Moreover, for students of color, it's ciritcal to have reflections of yourself 
in the curriculum. What I appreciate about this curriculum is that it was written by ethnic 
studies teachers, professors and educators of color.   

This curriculum will make for a better, more compassionate, aware, and just Oakland. 

Please support it. 

Thank you, 
Sasha Solomonov
