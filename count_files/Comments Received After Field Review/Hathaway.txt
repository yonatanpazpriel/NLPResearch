CF&IR Division, 
Liz Wheeler reported on OAN newscast 
that the California Legislature is enacting 
ethnic studies in California Schools that 
encourage the same agenda of the left 
wing fanatics in the U.S. Congress, 
namely Talib, Omar and AOC.  
I find this absolutely disgusting and very 
unamerican, and as a taxpayer supporting 
our school system in this state, am 
recommending this program be halted and 
destroyed.  
The California Governor and Legislature 
need to stop hating the President of The 
United States of America and work 
toward improving Californian's lives. 
Sincerely, 
Les Hathaway
