Subject: Please Include Anti-Semitism into the ESMC Model Curriculum before approving it. 

To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education 

I live in California and care a lot about educating our youth about diversity and inclusion of all types. I am 
writing to comment on your ESMC proposed curriculum and I oppose it as written today because it fails to 
discuss anti-semitism. I’m very concerned about the proposed curriculum which reinforces negative 
stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism. As it stands today I believe this curriculum would 
institutionalize the teaching of anti-semitic stereotypes in our public schools. – This is not right. 

I urge you to make major revisions or complete a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, 
consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, Stand With Us, Jimena, 
Amcha and others who are also calling for this change. It needs to include Anti-Semitism and discuss the long 
time persecution of Jews that continues today. 

I have friends who are Jewish and in today’s climate of hate in this country, Anti-Semitism is among the top 
hate crimes and I can’t believe that you are not including it in your proposed curriculum and that you are 
actually including some Anti-Semitic Tropes that will be teaching the next generation to wrongly hate Jews 
(and Israel). This is NOT inclusive and is not right. 

Please do not approve this curriculum as it stands. I want you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite 
of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. 

Thank you,
