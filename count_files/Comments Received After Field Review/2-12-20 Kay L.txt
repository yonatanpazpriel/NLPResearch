Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies – don’t shut out Arab-American experience 

Dear Instructional Quality Commission Shanine Coats, 

How can we ever hope to counter anti-Muslim sentiment if we don't teach our kids how Islamaphobic 
the GOP and the pretend-president are?   If we don't counter lies about Arab Americans, and teach our 
kids to respect differences in culture and religion, how will they form opinions not influenced by hate? 

To this end, I support Jewish Voice for Peace's petition as follows: 

I’m a constituent of yours and deeply concerned with reports that Arab American Studies may be cut 
from California’s Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), under the false premise of it not being within 
the four racialized groups of Ethnic Studies.  

The field’s leaders of color, including the Association of Asian American Studies, Asian American Studies 
Department Chairs, and the Save CA Ethnic Studies Coalition – are insisting Arab American Studies 
belongs in the curriculum, and that it remain.   

As is evident in the spirit of AB2016 legislation, the California Department of Education must respect 
communities of color, and have deference to Ethnic Studies professors and practitioners of color for this 
project. 

Efforts to undermine or water-down any critical components of the draft, and of Ethnic Studies as a field 
must be rejected.  

I know you are well-aware of the targeted attacks on Arabs and Muslims by the Trump administration, 
and the demonization of the struggle of migrants and people of color throughout the United States. As a 
sanctuary state, California should continue to be a counterweight against that trend – not serve as a 
stamp of approval. 

Sincerely, 
Kay L. 
San Leandro, CA
