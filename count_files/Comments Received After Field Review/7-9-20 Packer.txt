Subject: [EXTERNAL] include Arab American studies in the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) 

Dear Instructional Quality Commission,  

As a scholar, a proud California resident, a Jew, and a long-time supporter of Palestine, I urge 
you to keep the Arab American studies model curriculum intact. In this historical moment of 
far-right extremism and Islamaphobia worldwide, educating students comprehensively and 
fairly regarding the history and present situtation of the Levant has never been more 
important. Arab American studies is a critical component of Ethnic Studies and must not be 
erased or "revised" to suit Zionist fascists. Take a stand on the justice side of history and teach 
our global children well.  

Sincerely, 

Melina Packer, PhD (she/hers) | Chancellor's Postdoctoral Fellow
