Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish 

Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 

discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism 

and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

Please take this request seriously.  Children deserve to know about Judaism and Israel without a 
political and untrue bias. 
You do children a disservice when they fail to be taught a true and comprehensive history of 
the American Jewish experience.  Otherwise, you may perpetuate and augment anti-semitism. 
Thanks for reading and considering this email.
