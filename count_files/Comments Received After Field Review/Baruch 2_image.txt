Helio,

lam a community member deeply concerned about the California Department of
Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. This letter is to confirm that] added my
signature to the Israel-American.Community's official complaint,and have submitted this
complaint on my behalf.

The proposed coursework, as written, will turn California classrooms into discriminatory
and hostile environments for the young people in our community. This curriculum
endorses prejudice.against Jewish, Israeli-American and Zionist students, and delegitimizeés
their heritage and identity. It will lead to harassment; bullying, and discrimination.

This deeply biased curriculum has‘no place in our public schools, which should be forums
for teaching respectful dialogue, understanding, and tolerance.

Task that you respectfully consider putting ahold on the currently proposed curriculum
and meet our community leaders to discuss how to improve this deeply biased coursework,
which would create a hostile environment for Israeli-American and Jewish-American
students.

Thank you
