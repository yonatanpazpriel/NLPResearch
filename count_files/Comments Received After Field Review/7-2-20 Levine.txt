Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for the ESMC, including Arab American studies 

I am writing in support of the ESMC including Arab American Studies. If 
we want to raise and educate our next generation to be tolerant, to reject 
racist world views and behaviors, to reject xenophobic thinking and 
behaviors, we need to introduce our youth to the wealth of world views 
and behaviors that exist. Exposure to different and acceptance of 
different is essential. 
On another note, speaking as an American Jew, I want to make it clear that teaching 
about and respect for Arab and Muslim points of view and lifestyles is not anti-
semitic. As a Jew, I am insulted that others, including  Jews, believe they can speak 
for me when they say that including Arab American studies is anti-semitic. Again, 
that is a great insult. It is hot how I see the issue and I want my Jewish voice to be 
heard. I welcome "different", I welcome learning  and teaching about Arab 
Americans, I welcome being inclusionary, and I endorse the notion that Justice and 
Peace will come only when we understand each other and can use that 
understanding to work together. 

Thank you, 
Eleanor Levine
