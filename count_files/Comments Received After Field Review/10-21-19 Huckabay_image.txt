Dear Mr. Thurmond:

With great interest | read the article on “Education: Back lash spurs change to ethnic studies plan” that
was published in the Daily News newspaper on Thursday, August 15, 2019, pages 1 and 13.

The issue with ethnic studies courses at the high school or middle school levels, and even at the college
level is the criteria one uses to determine which cultures or ethnic groups should be included.
Additionally, how does one control for the biases that get introduced by the teachers’ own ethnicity
during instruction?

Instead, | would recommend a course in “CIVICS” be taught, where important concepts that transcend
all cultures and ethnicities be taught at different levels of depth depending upon the students’
educational level. These concepts could include civility; integrity; equality; justice; responsibility;
accountability; altruism; citizenship; honesty; respect for humans irrespective of age, nationality,
ethnicity and color; respect for animals, properties and the environment. | would also recommend that
the primary learning experience, especially for middle and high school students, be homework
assignments where each of these core values are addressed in weekly essays.

This is one of the most effective ways by which students will internalize these core values of life!
Respectfully,
