Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Good Morning: 

E Pluribus Unum used to be the model adopted by the United States to create a thriving and 
forward-looking citizen body. Diversity was meant to fertilize that concept by suggesting that 
different viewpoints contributed to that goal while not forcing assimilation of new immigrants. 
Instead, we are reducing this concept to tribalism some of which is bringing old animosities to our 
shores. While the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft may have been meant well, it removes the 
Jewish American narrative and demonizes Israel which any four year old can tell you is simple 
Antisemitism. Do the right thing. Either fix the curriculum or remove it.!
