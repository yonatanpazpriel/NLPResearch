Subject: [EXTERNAL] [Action Request] Vote "Yes" on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum TOMORROW 

Dear Oakland Board Members, 

I urge you to put “Students First” by supporting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum led 
by scholars of color from across California.  Oakland is exactly the kind of city that 
should stand up for our underrepresented communities. 

Ethnic Studies has always been about empowering students of color who are 
marginalized and minimized by our curriculum.  We need to bring this conversation back 
to the focus of Students First, one of our Core OUSD Values.  Our white students 
greatly benefit from having these critical conversations about race, so that all 
Oaklanders can build skills to navigate our society and build stronger communities and 
neighborhoods. 

Arab American Studies is important to me because Arabs are too often deemed an "other"--both 
in greater US society and in my personal Jewish community. As someone who speaks Arabic 
and spent considerable time in the Arab world, I want to ensure that my neighbors and 
community members understand and appreciate the depth of the varied histories, the beauty of 
the language, the delights of the customs--to humanize a group that is otherwise demonized in 
popular media. Though Jews and Arabs are not mutually exclusive groups, we are often pitted 
against each other. And yet we are natural allies.  

This controversy is a perfect example of why we need Ethnic Studies and why we must 
have these conversations to address racial tensions in our community, so that we can 
move toward healing, understanding, and solidarity across all of our cultures. 

Please vote YES, thank you!
