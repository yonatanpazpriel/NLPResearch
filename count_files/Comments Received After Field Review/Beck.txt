Dear Commission, 

The obvious problem is that those who came up with an antisemitic 
and historically inaccurate curriculum are still there. The makeup of the  
Instructional Quality Commission has not changed, with no resignations 
being submitted after an embarrassing curriculum was submitted for 
review. Many of the committee members are active teachers who, 
presumably, look unfavorably towards Jews. 

The much-maligned History Alive! text used by many school districts is 
bad enough, yet that content is understandable when learning which 
foreign country financially influenced the curriculum. There is no 
excuse for a new ethnic studies curriculum to promote a narrative that 
is biased, historically inaccurate, and bereft of context.
