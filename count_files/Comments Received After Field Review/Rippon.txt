Jim Rippon 

I am the son of Elaine B. Rippon, a highly respected teacher of over 30 years at LAUSD. If she were alive today, she 
would be appalled, embarrassed and felt disgraced and disrespected by the State Department of Education wanting 
to remove the truth from history about capitalism and teach students that it is a racist economic system! Capitalism is 
THE ONLY economic system that has raised all people up and out of poverty! It is the only economic system in 
history that guarantees people of all colors and beliefs an equal opportunity of success. No other economic system in 
the history of the world, socialism including so called democratic socialism, which really doesn't exist and is just 
socialism, marxism, fascism and communism have ever lifted people up and out of poverty or raised their standard of 
living. All these other economic systems have killed about 180 million people in total! If capitalism is so racist, then 
why have millions of people fled all those countries with no capitalism to come to the United States? You want to 
make capitalism evil and teach exactly what everybody is fleeing from and what this country was founded against, 
into a literal third world country! And you are hypocrites as you have benefited from capitalism, just like everyone in 
America has, yet you want to keep people from being prosperous by teaching an economic system that will ruin 
everyone's lives! You should be ashamed at what you are doing! What a disgrace you are!
