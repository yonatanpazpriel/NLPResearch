Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American studies 

1. I am a student. 
2. I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies. 
3. First of all, it is incredibly important to include Arab American studies in our education 
systems within the rubric of Asian American studies. For too long, Arab history has been 
ignored and overlooked and that needs to end. I am going into my senior year of high school 
and the only time I ever learned about anything relating to Arab history or culture, was one 
time, for thirty minutes, in the 8th grade and that is so wrong. Second of all, it is also crucial to 
include West Asian American experiences in the ESMC. There is so much propaganda and false 
information in the media regarding Islam and Arabs, so if some of these misconceptions are 
debunked in school, it will prevent numerous things from spreading and continuing. Some of 
them include islamophobia, and xenophobia. Another point I would like to make is that 
Palestinian history and current struggles NEEDS to be talked about and included in this 
curriculum. The genocide and ethnic cleansing that has been occurring in Palestine is not 
brought enough attention to. So many people have no idea what is going on, or they have a 
false perception on the  occupation, therefor it is very important that it be taught correctly to 
us in school. Doing this is not anti semetic in any way. Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism, 
because not all Jews are zionists, and not all zionists are Jews. If Palestine is going to be taught 
in schools it is important that it is taught correctly and not in an anti semetic way.  
Thank you, 
Batool Mohammad
