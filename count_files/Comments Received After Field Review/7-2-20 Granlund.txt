Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM 

In this era of xenophobia and Islamophobia, it is critically important  
to include Arab American Studies (under the rubric of Asian American  
Studies) in the ESMC - particularly the historic and current struggles  
in Palestine. These struggles will continue to dominate international  
relations for decades, and it is certainly not antisemitic to include a  
balanced, accurate review of events that will aid students in  
understanding the issues involved. Our public discussions tend to  
include only partisan dog whistles and blind loyalties. 

Our universities boast many distinguished Arab American scholars and  
ethnic studies experts who should be tapped to provide the guidance  
needed to develop these programs. 

Thank you for your attention to my comments.
