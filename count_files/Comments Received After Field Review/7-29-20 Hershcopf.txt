Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab-American Studies 

Dear Department of Education, Superintendent Thurmond and President Darling-Hammond, 

I am writing in strong support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), and particularly for 
inclusion of Arab-American Studies in that curriculum.  As a parent and a life-long supporter of public 
education, I recognize the importance of the ESMC for all students.  The fact that I’m a Jewish woman 
should not make a difference, but because I’m aware that you’re hearing from Jewish people who 
oppose the inclusion of Arab-American Studies I want to make it clear that they do not speak for me and 
for many other Jewish people who recognize the critical importance of including Arab-American Studies 
in the ESMC. 

So many current issues highlight how crucial Ethnic Studies is to our country and our upcoming 
generations. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian 
Americans as “vectors” of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd 
point to the need for anti-racist education: All students  need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to 
build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice. 

As you are well aware, the ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of 
Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and 
Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab 
American studies within Asian American studies. Leading Asian American scholars, including the 
Association of Asian American Studies, have issued statements supporting and defending the inclusion 
of Arab American studies in the California ESMC. 

Thank you for your consideration.
