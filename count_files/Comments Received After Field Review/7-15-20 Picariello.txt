Dear Sirs and Madames, 
I am a retired Teacher’s Aide with the SFUSD. 
And a parent of a mentally challenged adult. 
As an educator I see first hand the many compromising 
Situations a person of color, and particularly SPED students 
Of color face each day.  Having proper medical care is often 
Times overlooked in favor of sending their student to school 
With cough due to cold…both parents work and there are 
Insufficient funds for at home child care…so, in a more multitudinous 
Society, not only should there be generous funding available 
For child care, but also, more generously funded ethnic studies 
Programs included at ALL levels of education. 
This kind of unilateral support would bolster international studies 
Programs at home and abroad. 
Thanks for your time. 
Dave Picariello 
Teacher’s Aide SFUSD retired.
