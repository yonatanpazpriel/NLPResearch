Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethic Studies Model Curriculum. 

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish 
Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism 
and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

It’s time to put the brakes on this controversial, radical curriculum that omits the Jewish 
perspective and promotes an anti-Israel agenda! 

My Prayer to God Almighty is that you die to your flesh and live in your Spirit, your Spirit that 
God Almighty made.  

How dare you mislead our children into teaching them falsehoods—lies!  

Please teach them about Jesus! You have Gods Holy Bible. Please use it for Gods Holy Words are 
the only truth in this world!  

Please equip the children you teach with the only truth in this world, Gods Holy Bible!  

Please don’t teach them a falsehood!
