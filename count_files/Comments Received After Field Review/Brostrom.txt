Subject: REVOKING THE CURRICULUM FRAMEWORK FOR ETHNIC STUDIES 

The new "Ethnic Studies" curriculum teaches children through the grades that capitalisms ( a 
Marxist term for the free enterprise system) is "racist", white supremacist, and the same as, 
"oppressive patriarchy". It encourages student to study the life of the radical like a fugitive cop 
killer Joanne Chesimard aka Assata Shakur who was convicted in the murder of a new Jersey 
State Trooper Werner Foerster. Chesimard was sentenced to life in prison but escaped in 
November 1979 and eventually traveled to Cuba. Fidel Castro granted her asylum and she has 
been living under the name Assata Shakur. She is idolized by the "Black Live Matters" 
movement and helped organized the Women's March. 

The curriculum is also anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. It portrays Jews as part of a conspiracy to 
oppress people around the world and urges children to participate in the BDS movement to 
boycott Israel, who in fact as our strongest ally in the Middle East. 

It also teaches that Iran, a proud sponsor of Hezbollah, is an ally of the United States. In fact, 
their leaders call Israel "The Little Satan" and the United States as "The Great Satan". One of the 
Curriculum Board members believes that "Israel doesn't have the right to exist". 

(Doesn't anyone know about Dachau and Auschwitz?)
