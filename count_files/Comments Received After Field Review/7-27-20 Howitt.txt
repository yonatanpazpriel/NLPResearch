Subject: [EXTERNAL] Saving Arab studies 

Hello, 

I am a student currently studying Anthropology at USC, and this is a topic that is 
extremely important to me. In this time of conflict and controversy, I would argue that it is 
more important now than ever to protect the ESMC, including Arab American studies. As a 
Jewish student in particular, it is imperative to include Palestine in all studies involving the Arab 
world. This is NOT antisemetic, but rather, about human rights.  
Please be on the right side of history and save Arab American studies. This is a huge issue, and 
many people will be watching to make sure you do the right thing. 

Thank you very much, 

Anna Howitt
