Dear Honorable Mr. Thurmond, 

First, I would like to say that I think you are doing a great job as State Superintendent. I read 
your plan: I think it is well structured and inclusive. 

In light of another round of viral outrage due to injustice against black people in America, I 
argue that people should be educated about this problem from a young age. As State 
Superintendent, you are in the unique position to actually create change. I see that part of your 
plan as Superintendent is to create inclusive schools. I think, however, that we should go 
beyond training teachers on how to dissipate racism. 

I implore you to be radical and consider adding a curriculum to elementary, middle school, 
and high school which addresses racism. It should be a required competency for our young 
people. The ultimate goal here would be to reduce implicit bias. 

We cannot break the cycle of injustice without firmly addressing this issue for our youths and 
future leaders. While overt racism is taboo, we must address the problem and discourage 
covert and overt racism. As a student who attended public elementary, middle, and high 
school in Sacramento County, I lament that I never received guidance about racism from my 
teachers. It certainly was not addressed at home. 

It is never too early to begin navigating children through difficult concepts such as racism. We 
should teach non-black people how to be an effective ally, and we should normalize 
discussions about racism. Please do not leave it up to teachersâ€™ discretion how and if they will 
work to dissipate racism. 

Please consider what I am asking and let me know what else I can do to help. I hope to be a 
part of the change. 

Sincerely, and with admiration, 

Natalia Maverakis
