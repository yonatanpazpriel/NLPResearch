Hello - Iâ€™m emailing to indicate my support for the ESMC, including Arab American studies.   I am an Arab American 
and my kids are in public schools and would appreciate a more rounded educational experience for them to 
include their heritage as well as a balanced view of the Palestinian Israeli conflict.  This will foster future 
collaboration and path for peace in the Middle East for all students as they will be future generations maintaining 
any potential peace plans that we may or may not be able to accomplish in our lifetime.   

Thank you 

Amjad Ramahi
