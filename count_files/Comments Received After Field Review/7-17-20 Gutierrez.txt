Dear Sir or Madam, 

I urge you all to include Arab American studies as part of Asian American Studies. 
Rise of nationalism in Europe and here in USA brings consequences 
like isolationism,exclusionary citizenship, socioeconomic marginalization 
, Islamophobia and xenophobia.Now more than ever it is very important to teach 
students about diversity, tolerance and strategies to reduce its exclusionary and 
virulent side.This must include the history of the Palestinian people 
and its struggle for human rights Please listen to Arab American scholars and 
Ethnic Studies practitioners and collaborate with them as you revise school 
curricula.  

Sincerely,  

•  Marina A.P.Gutierrez
