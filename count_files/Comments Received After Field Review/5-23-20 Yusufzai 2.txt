Hello Trustees, 

In this time, we will be remembered for the acts of courage we took. It is courageous to stand on 
the side of equity. I've lived in this community for 5 and in 2020, it is about time we got Ethnic 
Studies fully implemented in our Oakland schools, 50 years after programs were established at 
our universities here in the Bay Area.  

I hope this Board will stand strong to pass the Ethnic Studies resolution, and am fully expecting 
this board to make real its resolution by getting more Ethnic Studies classes with more Ethnic 
Studies teachers. 

The current attacks on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft are completely false and 
racist, and OUSD must stand against attempts to censor and whitewash our curriculum. Arab 
American, Pacific Islander and Central American Studies should all be included and not 
removed. 

When others are afraid to stand up for justice, Oakland will stand up unafraid. 

The time is now for racial justice. Don't delay. 

Peace
