Dear Whomever this May Concern, 

I am a recent 2020 graduate of San Francisco State University and I have been extremely positively 
impacted by the Ethnic Studies classes I took at SFSU. In fact, these classes were some of my 
favorite I have taken. I strongly support the ESMC including Arab American Studies.   

The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: 
American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American 
studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American 
studies within Asian American studies. Leading Asian American scholars, including the National 
Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab 
American studies in the CA ESMC. 

Additionally I think it is vital to note that Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive 
personal, academic, and social outcomes for students. I know that my education was made full 
because of Ethnic Studies and it is what I treasure most from my education.  

Thank you, 

Louisa Armstrong  
SFSU Alumna
