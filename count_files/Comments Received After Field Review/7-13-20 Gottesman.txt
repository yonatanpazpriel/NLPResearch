Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of including Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum 

To the IQC: 

As a resident of Oakland, Ca  and a Jewish American I am writing to ask you 
to PLEASE KEEP the ethnic studies model curriculum INTACT with Arab 
American Studies within the rubric of Asian American studies.  Any revisions 
of the Arab American studies curriculum should be made in collaboration 
with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. Arab American 
studies including the history and current struggles in Palestine must be 
included.   

As a member of Jewish Voice for Peace I know how very important it is that 
we educate our youth to help wipe out islamophobia and gain an 
understanding of Palestinian Americans' experience.   It is also important to 
me that Jewish organizations opposing this curriculum not be thought of as 
representing all  Jews.  They  do NOT.   They certainly do not represent me. 

Thank you,
