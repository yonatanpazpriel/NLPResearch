Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies & Arab American studies 

Hello,  

I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies 
within the rubric of Asian American studies. In this era 
of Islamophobia and xenophobia, itâ€™s important to 
include West Asian American experiences in the 
ESMC. The history and current struggles in Palestine 
be included, and it is not antisemitic to defend human 
rights, and include Palestinian history and current 
movements in ethnic studies. I demand that revisions 
that affect Arab American studies should be made in 
collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic 
Studies practitioners. 

Thank you,
