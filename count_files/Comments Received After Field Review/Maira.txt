Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education, 

For over 50 years, communities of color have struggled to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in 
California. Students and faculty have advocated for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a 
legitimate academic discipline through sit-ins, rallies and strikes. Research shows when Ethnic 
Studies is taught, it results in narrowing and closing of the opportunity gap for students from 
underserved communities.  

Yet faculty in ethnic studies and scholars of color--including colleagues at UC Davis--are being 
attacked, harassed, and threatened by right-wing groups and activists for advocating for ethnic 
studies.  

We urge you not to give in to right-wing racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, anti-
progressivism, and anti-intellectualism that does not respect the languages, histories and cultural 
backgrounds of students of color. Students should be given the opportunity to study about their 
ancestral roots to better understand the present, and be able to imagine a brighter, more just and 
equitable future for California, the US, and the world. 

Sincerely, 

Sunaina Maira 
Professor, Asian American Studies, UC Davis
