Subject: [EXTERNAL] In Support of Arab American and Ethnic Studies 

Hello,  

My name is Mousa Abedelal and I just graduated from high school in San Francisco. I will be attending Community 
College in the Fall. I am Palestinian and I support of Arab ethnic studies. In school, there was little representation 
of Arabs. We were only talked about in different wars, but our experience with wars and our stories need to be 
told from our perspectives. People only learn about us from the media, where we’re terrorists and nothing more.  

This is why we need to keep Arab studies. Even though we’re considered white on applications, most of us don’t 
get white privilege. Support ethnic studies and keep Palestinian Americans on that curiculum so that people can 
learn more about us and who our people are. 

Best,  
Mousa Abedelal
