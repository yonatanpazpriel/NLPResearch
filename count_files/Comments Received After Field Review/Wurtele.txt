Dear Committee, 

I was appalled and saddened after reading the ethnic studies curriculum on your web site.  
This curriculum would create hurt and hate, rather than bring students together and in touch with 
the beauties and subtleties of different ethnicities. It would particularly deeply hurt Jewish 
American children (and their parents). It would also increase hate -rather than understanding--in 
Arab Americans. 

For example, the Sample Course for Arab studies . 

Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter---  

Equating Black Lives Matter with the Palestinian situation?  

African Americans were forcibly taken to this country as slaves, and 

systematically persecuted in the most horrible ways. America was 100% to 

blame and it is a tremendous shame on our nation. Every African American 

descendent of slavery  

Israeli Arabs either stayed in Israel live in peace and are full citizens with 

representatives in Knesset, or they fled, mostly in response to calls by Egypt, 

saying they would reconquer the Jews and push them into the sea. .Unlike any 

other group of refugees, they were not accepted into the new countries in which 

they resided. They were kept in camps by Arabs of other countries without 

citizenship, and have kept as refugees and political pawns for 70 years by Arabs 

of other countries. Israel "occupied" the West Bank and Gaza only after being 

attacked from all sides.  

Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel- Really- is Israel to be singled 

out?? Why not boycott Palestinian Territories and other Arab nations who tacitly 

allow "honor " killing of women and gays

770265cf4962_story.html. What about boycotting the Muslim countries who 

condon female circumcision ? Or Gaza, because of the children who are forced 

into blowing themselves to bits in suicide attacks, their kindergarten curriculum of

sraeli%E2%80%93Palestinian_conflict. Or perhaps Arab countries for 

persecution of their religious minorities such as Christian-Arabs, Jewish-Arabs, 

Yazidi-Arabs . How about the nearly half a million people killed by the Syrian 

government. What about China's detention in barbed wire facilities of 1-2 million 

innocent Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyzs Muslims ? Or Gaza and the West Bank 

for perpetuating hate in the minds of their children

education/ instead of working towards a peaceful Palestinian nation.  

It will be important to include The Jewish Caucus, whose thoughtful letter to you I have read, in 
your discussions.  

Thank you, 
Eve Wurtele
