I urge the Department to reject the model curriculum for ethnic studies. This curriculum would teach students that (1) 
someone without a disability is an oppressor, (2) capitalism is racism, (3) cop killers and terrorists should be admired 
and studied, and (4) Israel is a country which practices apartheid. All four of these themes are factually incorrect. 
Furthermore, regarding capitalism, this system has lifted millions of minorities out of poverty, not only in the U.S., but 
around the world. This model curriculum would indoctrinate California's students; it would not teach them how to 
analyze the world around them in a thoughtful, fact-based manner.
