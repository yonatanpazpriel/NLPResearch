Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti Semitic and Anti Israel curriculum 

Dear Soomin Chao, 
Please reject the current Anti Semitic and Anti Israel curriculum that has been insidiously 
injected into the educational system. California students deserve a bias-free education that will 
prepare them for life, not radical brainwashing that will cripple their future. 
Regards, 
Dan Yakir
