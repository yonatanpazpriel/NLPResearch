Concern, 

 I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being 

adopted by California school boards. 

It is most unfair to adopt a curriculum that  promotes anti-semitic and radical anti-

Israel content, and to focus on those accused of anti-semitism. A balanced 

curriculum would be beneficial to all. This controversial radical curriculum, that 

omits the Jewish perspective and promotes an anti-Israel agenda is absolutely 

unacceptable. 

To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a 

curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-

Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 

criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our 

public schools.” 

Thanks and regards 

sharmila
