Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public comment on CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

I support keeping the ESMC intact; specifically, continuing to include Arab American studies. 

Arab Americans are Americans just like every other American. Not only is this curriculum good 
for Arab Americans, it is very important for other Americans to learn about it as well. In this age 
of rising Islamophobia, xenophobia, and general racism against “brown” people, Arab 
Americans are particularly at risk. 

I am Jewish, and I even have Arab Americans within my own family - related by blood! Failure to 
support Arab Americans is a failure to support my family. 

I am Jewish, and I also support Palestinian rights, a 2-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, and a condemnation of the Israeli occupation, West Bank settlements, annexation 
plans, and persecution of Palestinians. This also needs to be included in the curriculum. It is not 
antisemitic to defend human rights. 

Sincerely,  
Dr. Sharon Minsuk
