Subject: [EXTERNAL] Regarding the proposed new California school curriculum of diversity snd ethnic 
studies 

Dear elected officials, 

This new curriculum does not reflect all minorities that make up California’s diverse ethnicities. In order to combat 
all forms of racial and ethnic prejudice, education is key. This kind of education starting with our youngest children 
should include education about the Jewish people’s history and contributions to California to combat antisemitism 
which is rampant now in the US and Europe on social media and increasing hate crimes. We can do our part by 
educating a future generation of Californians to replace ignorance with knowledge and hate with tolerance. 

Sincerely, 

Debra Barach Schaffer MD
