Dear Tony and rest of the Department of Education Staff, 

Hope you are well this weekend. I have been brought to my attention about latest development of 
the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I respectfully ask that this curriculum be reviewed by a 
non biased manner and edited thereof to reflect a nonbiased and un-politicized education 
material for our future generations. 

I attached a detailed document for your reference.  

Thank you for all you do, 
Peter Tsai
