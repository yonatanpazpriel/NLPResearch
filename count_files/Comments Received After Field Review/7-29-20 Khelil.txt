Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support addition of Arab Americans 

To whom it may concern, 

Sadly, Palestinian identity has long been defamed and continues to be. The attempt to erase Arab-Americans from 
ethnic studies is the latest attempt. Please do the right thing: stand up for the humanity of all people. 

Best Regards,
