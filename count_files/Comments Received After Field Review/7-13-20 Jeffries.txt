I write you to offer my thoughts and comments on the upcoming decisions by 
the Instructional Quality Commission regarding the California Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum for the coming school year. 

I understand there is a well-heeled, concerted and coordinated campaign to not allow 
Arab American Studies as part of the ESMC. This is a true shame, and reflects the 
power of the long-time, ultra-right imperial forces in the Middle East--and in the US--
unfortunately continue to yield to insure their hegemony over the lives of millions of 
people.  

Prohibiting students' rights to access and study of a targeted peoples is a crime against 
education, efforts to instill peace and justice, and protect the innate rights of people and 
cultures already violently oppressed for far too long. It is a strategy of keeping people 
ignorant of certain, selected, targeted populations so that manipulation of 
reality/propaganda can be substituted for honest presentation with the goal of denying 
any chance of understanding, acceptance, solidarity, or finding common ground among 
different nations and peoples in order to continue robbing them of their land, culture, 
humanity, life. When only one-sided claims are allowed to be read or heard against a 
people or nation, it's a lot easier to oppress and even destroy them. 

I sincerely hope you will make your decisions based on inclusion, fairness and 
scholastic professionalism, and not buckle to those who want to manipulate students' 
understanding and attitudes to further oppress others. 

Thank you, 

Tim Jeffries
