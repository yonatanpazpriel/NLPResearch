Believing in the God of Abraham, or not believing, will not change the consequences of 
ignorance to His word. "Those who Bless Israel will be Blessed, and those who curse Israel will 
be cursed", if you Love California, if you do not want to be cursed, do not incorporate the false 
Palestinian narratives into your schools curriculum, draw nigh unto God, please do not be 
decieved Christ is about to return, ask Christ for forgiveness, your and my sins put Christ on the 
Cross, please do onto others as you would want them to do to you and stop all 
discrimination...May the God of Abraham stir your heart, as you cry out in Jesus Name..
