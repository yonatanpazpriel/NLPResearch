Subject: Bias in proposed ethnic studies program 

It seems crazy that 80 years after the mass murder of almost the entirety of  the Jewish population of Europe there 
is now a movement to make the Country of Israel 🇮🇱 a state founded by folks who barely escaped the death camps 
and who saw their families murdered,” an illegitimate enterprise”. 
  Read Mark Twain’ description of the area written in the late 19th century. The area was an empty wasteland prior 
to Jewish Immigration. 
   My wife’s family who had lived in Egypt for generations were dispossessed imprisoned and expelled from Egypt 
in the early 1950s , along with 800,000 other Jews forced on pain of death to leave their homes in Arab countries. 
    Not to mention the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, an Arab leader and hero then and now who sat by Hitler’s side, 
and visited death camps and encouraged Hitler in his murderous rampage. 
     There have been so many efforts by international and Jewish groups trying to end the fighting, all rebuffed by 
Arab/Palestinian groups. 
    The Pitts report of 1936 allowing for a tiny Jewish State, met by the Arabs by viscous riots and by the British 
refusing to allow desperate Jewish refugees from Europe to  enter the “mandate”.  
      Numerous other attempts,read President Clinton’s biography where he describes what happened at Camp 
David, all met with  
rejection. 
       All of this should be included in the proposed ethnic studies program. 
          Thank you for your attention, 
              Sincerely, 
                Gerald Tarder
