I am expressing my extreme concern about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. I add my voice to the Thursday, 
August 8, 2019 editorial in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune. It is time to add objective, factual discourse in our public 
schools instead of pandering to ANY political agendas. I urge the Board to seek a balanced model curriculum 
encouraging students to consider many viewpoints and to think for themselves. Stop politics in the schools. Stop 
America bashing.
