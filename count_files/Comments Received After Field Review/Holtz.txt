In my view this whole curriculum serves only to drive wedges in our 
society.  We should emphasize in our schools what brings us together 
as a nation.  I think ethnic diversity is a strength of our country and that 
should be celebrated.  Instead, this curriculum seems to promote only 
division and victimhood.  I think the whole course model is completely 
misguided and should be abandoned.
