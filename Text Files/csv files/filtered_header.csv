From: on behalf of Sally Nalven Sent: Thursday, November 12, 2020 12:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Critical Race Theory from the ESMC

Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,

I am an educator who is deeply concerned about the ESMC.

The ESMC continues to be based on critical race theory, a controversial and divisive ideology that is the wrong way to address the urgent issue of race in our high schools. Critical race theory divides people into oppressor and oppressed groups, creating a hostile and disempowering classroom environment for students. It is polarizing, not uniting. Simply put, we are told to teach students to first label people by the color of their skin, and then condemn white people as being racist.

Critical race theory is in opposition to California State Board of Education's obligation to not adopt instructional materials ""that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race."" (CA Education Code Section 51501). California teachers must ""impress upon the minds of the pupils ...the promotion of harmonious relations"" and not promote ""discriminatory bias on the basis of race"" in our classrooms. (CA Education Code Sections 233.5(a) and 51500).

Last month, Educators for Excellence in Education submitted a request to the IQC to remove critical race theory, explicit and implicit, from the ESMC. This group also submitted a detailed list of all explicit critical race theory references in the September ESMC, including a list of laws, standards, and guidelines related to this request. I ask that you use this as a basis for removing critical race theory from the ESMC and developing a curriculum that will accomplish the ethnic studies goals that we all want to achieve.

Sincerely, Sally Nalven Sally Nalven

From: on behalf of Albert Haddad Sent: Wednesday, November 11, 2020 5:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Protect Butler's Palestinian students

Dear The Instructional Quality Commission CA,

As a supporter of Jewish Voice for Peace, I am writing to express my disappointment at the the treatment of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.

Arab American studies belongs within Asian American studies, not relegated to the index of the ESMC ï¿½ and the fact that Palestine is not mentioned at all is completely unacceptable. Students deserve an education that isn't hampered by anti-Palestinian lobbying. A robust Arab American series within the ESMC is absolutely critical.

California often paves the way for progressive legislation nationwide. But if the ESMC is adopted as proposed, it will be lifted up and promoted by anti-Palestinian organizations as a model for other states.

Furthermore, the IHRA's controversial ""definition"" of antisemitism must not be included in the ESMC. This definition exists to silence critics of Israel. It has nothing to do with Jewish safety or dismantling real antisemitism. In fact, using accusations of antisemitism for political purposes puts Jewish people in danger. This deeply flawed definition must not become a part of California's statewide curriculum.

I am calling on you to:

1) Return the Arab American lesson plan to where it belongs, within Asian American studies 2) Stop censoring Palestinian narratives from Arab-American lesson plans, and 3) Remove all definitions of antisemitism that conflate criticism of Israel or Zionism to antisemitism

Sincerely, Albert Haddad [email redacted]

From: Mariano Svidler Sent: Wednesday, November 11, 2020 10:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not remove Arab Americans from our states curriculum

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

I'm disheartened to hear that elected officials have caved to tremendous pressure to exclude Arab Americans from California's high school ethnic studies curriculum by relegating the Arab American lesson to the appendix, insisting on the inclusion of ""various perspectives"" on racism, and not consulting experts on the revisions to the overall curriculum.

If the biggest education system in the United States decides Arab-American Studies and ethnic studies are a ""problem,"" we're going to face a dire precedent. I'm emailing you to ask that you please reject adopting these offensive revisions.

If there was ever a time that we should be protecting anti-racist education, and ensuring students learn about struggles of indigenous and racialized communities at school--including that of Arab Americans--and not on TV or random YouTube autoplay sessions, it's now.

The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies.

TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to AYO's findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school.

Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.

Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students. And in the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.



Furthermore, the racial disparities in the impact of COVID-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as ""vectors"" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.

In light of all of this information, I ask that you please reject adopting the offensive revisions (relegating the Arab American lesson to the appendix, insisting on the inclusion of ""various perspectives"" on racism, etc) to the curriculum.

Thank you, Mariano Svidler [email redacted]

Sincerely, Mariano Svidler

Re: Maintain Key Improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Dear ESMC Public Comment Inbox, Thank you for your hard work and efforts to revise and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The latest ESMC draft contains key changes and additions that I urge you to maintain, including: ï¿½ Important references to antisemitism, including information about its origins and ongoing prevalence in the United States ï¿½ Lesson plans that highlight and explore the diversity of the Jewish community, Jewish identity, and the Jewish American experience ï¿½ The removal of explicitly antisemitic and anti-Israel content ï¿½ Safeguards to help prevent hatred and bias in California schools Antisemitic incidents and hate crimes targeting members of the Jewish community, including Jewish students, have been steadily rising in recent years, as have other similar forms of bigotry. Education is a critical tool for combating hate and promoting respect and social harmony. To that end, teaching about the diverse cultural histories, important contributions, challenges and triumphs of California's numerous ethnic communities is long overdue and more essential than ever. The ESMC will impact the education of millions of students and the importance of maintaining the improvements outlined above cannot be overstated. Thank you again and please continue to embrace the core values of inclusion, equity, and balance within the curriculum.

Dear California Department of Education and State Board of Education,

While I appreciate some of the changes that have been made in the ESMC, I am still concerned about changes that still need to be made.

I am extremely concerned about the Critical Ethnic Studies' (ES) polarizing approach and narrow ideology that still corrupt a curriculum that should build bridges among all students and ethnic groups. I ask that you replace the Critical ES foundation in the Guiding Values and Principles AND the resulting lessons, with a Constructive ES foundation, which is more consistent with the desirable outcomes stated by the CDE and SBE.

This includes:

1. Removing the us-versus-them Critical ES ideology and revising lessons to confront racism and discrimination with mutual respect and empathy;

2. Removing content or figures that promote violence or demean any ethnic group;

3. Replacing the narrow ideological lens that romanticizes any one-sided political, economic, militant, or separatist movement, with a balanced evaluation including both positive and negative sides of the movement or ""ism"";

4. Replacing Critical ES language and leading questions that assume a foregone conclusion, with broader constructive language that invites inquiry from multiple perspectives.

I add my voice to the requests from the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. We all want a constructive Ethnic Studies curriculum, such as that of the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), which represents the struggles and contributions of ethnic groups and confronts racism, while building mutual understanding among all students and fostering balanced analysis.

Thank you for all the improvements to the curriculum so far, and for your thoughtful consideration of these crucial revisions for the benefit of all the students in our state.

Respectfully, Joanne Donsky

Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education:

I am a parent who is deeply concerned about the latest draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), which continues to be based on critical race theory.

Critical race theory divides students by race into oppressor and oppressed groups, creating a discriminatory, hostile, and disempowering classroom environment for students. Critical race theory states that racism is pervasive and permanent and rejects principles of objectivity, neutrality, and equal opportunity.

Critical race theory conflicts with your obligation as State Board of Education members not to adopt instructional materials ""that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race."" (CA Education Code Section 51501) It also conflicts with our obligation, as California teachers, to ""impress upon the minds of the pupils ...the promotion of harmonious relations"" and not promote ""discriminatory bias on the basis of race"" in our classrooms. (CA Education Code Sections 233.5(a) and 51500)

I ask that you vote to remove critical race theory from the ESMC by:

1. Deleting the ESMC's directive for educators to learn critical race theory as a key framework and pedagogy for teaching ethnic studies. 2. Removing the ESMC's second definition of race which calls it ""a (neo)colonial...'master category' (that) break(s) down as people of color (POC) and white people."" 3. Deleting all ESMC references to ""whiteness,"" ""racial hierarchy,"" and ""racial privilege"" as well as race-specific qualifiers preceding the words ""supremacy"" and ""privilege."" 4. Removing from the ESMC resources and UC-approved course outlines that present critical race theory as the only approach to understanding race relations.

By rejecting critical race theory at your upcoming meeting in March, you will help ensure that the ESMC accomplishes the California legislature's goal -- ""preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."" (AB 2016)

Sincerely,

Lia Rensin

1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: - Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community - Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart

2. At minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.

The ""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.

3. As a first generational Chinese, I know what it is like to grow up being part of the only Chinese family in a small town (Scranton, PA). I wish there were class lessons about the Asians (let alone Chinese) in school to give me support for being ""different"".

Dear Department of Education,

To begin, I wanted to applaud your effort to increase awareness of diversity in the United States. As we face an increasingly global economy and diverse world, it is imperative that we grow in our awareness of cultural differences.

However, as I review the prospective curriculum as presented in the final field review, I have my concerns and reservations. From the content, I believe it is unduly presenting information that inspires hatred and fear in students. At their young age, immersing them in this much hatred and fear will negatively impact their psychological development and potentially destroy the future of a whole generation. Instead, teaching them to choose love and forgiveness in place of hatred and fear is the only way for society to be united instead of dividing into fragmented divisions.

To reiterate, I believe your new curriculum misses the mark in increasing cultural awareness and diversity. It is filled with too much language that will inspire fear and hatred towards certain demographics and sow disunity in a nation that needs more open mindedness towards all people now more than ever. We instead need a curriculum based on objective facts instead of based on sensationalism, one that celebrates the achievements of people who succeeded despite the odds instead of focusing on hatred towards others. I implore you to reconsider presenting this curriculum to our impressionable and crucial younger generation, on whom rest the hopes of our nation's future, and instead teach them how to respect all people and ideas rather than increasing fear and hatred towards certain people and ideas.

Thank you for your time and consideration in hearing the opinions of the American people and the general public.

Sincerely,

Joyce Lin

To the Ethnic Studies,

It is very disappointing to have to continuously write to stop antisemitism from being implemented in our children's' Ethnic curriculum studies.

Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term ""privilege"" is used. White privilege is racist and it needs to stop. We need to celebrate our differences and educators to teach without prejudice, promote tolerance, not hostility!

https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/327667/jews-have-until-thursday-to-influence-ethnic-studiescurriculum/

The current draft of the mandatory Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in California celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting ""Jews of color"" against Jews who are tarred with ""conditional whiteness"" and its attendant ""racial privilege.""

Dear State Board of Education,

I write this letter in support of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) request for revisions to the final draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the State Board of Education (SBE) in March 2021.

The desired revisions which are focused on usability, accessibility, and equity are as follows:

1. The ""Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth"" Lesson, Sample Lesson #31 in Appendix A, should be listed as the first sample lesson in the AAPI unit and be rewritten to remove stereotypes and to incorporate reflection based on analyzing data.

2. Language should be added to Chapter 3: Instructional Guidance for K-12 Education to frame ""Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth"" as a foundational lesson to the AAPI Unit and as an indispensable component of any Ethnic Studies course.

3. In the AAPI Unit, the pan-Asian lesson plans should be listed first, followed by one lesson plan per ethnic group in alphabetical order, and concluding with an additional resources section for groups with more than one lesson plan. Groups with more than one lesson plan should provide input on which lesson plan is foundational for their group.

4. Appendix A should be reclassified as ""Chapter 4"" in the ESMC and ""Chapter 4: Bibliography"" should be reclassified as ""Chapter 5: Bibliography"" Appendices A and B (formerly Appendices B and C). The lesson plans must be highlighted as core content for educators to build Ethnic Studies courses, not as supporting content in an Appendix.

""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" is an indispensable asset to the teaching of Ethnic Studies. I join local, statewide, and national organizations in support of the final approval of the ESMC; with these edits to the AAPI Unit and to the ESMC in general, I believe California students will soon experience a curriculum that better represents the diversity of our community.

Dear The Instructional Quality Commission CA,

As a supporter of Jewish Voice for Peace, I am writing to express my disappointment at the the treatment of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.

Arab American studies belongs within Asian American studies, not relegated to the index of the ESMC ï¿½ and the fact that Palestine is not mentioned at all is completely unacceptable. Students deserve an education that isn't hampered by anti-Palestinian lobbying. A robust Arab American series within the ESMC is absolutely critical.

California often paves the way for progressive legislation nationwide. But if the ESMC is adopted as proposed, it will be lifted up and promoted by anti-Palestinian organizations as a model for other states.

Furthermore, the IHRA's controversial ""definition"" of antisemitism must not be included in the ESMC. This definition exists to silence critics of Israel. It has nothing to do with Jewish safety or dismantling real antisemitism. In fact, using accusations of antisemitism for political purposes puts Jewish people in danger. This deeply flawed definition must not become a part of California's statewide curriculum.

I am calling on you to:

1) Return the Arab American lesson plan to where it belongs, within Asian American studies 2) Stop censoring Palestinian narratives from Arab-American lesson plans, and 3) Remove all definitions of antisemitism that conflate criticism of Israel or Zionism to antisemitism

Dear Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board of Education, and Superintendent Tony Thurmond:

I appreciate all the hard work that has gone into the development of an Ethnic Studies Model curriculum over the last two years. I fully support the development of an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that centers on the narratives of the four foundational groups of Ethnic Studies--Black, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islander, and Native Americans--while also finding a way to meaningful include the many, diverse communities that make up our state, including Jews.

As you know, many in the Jewish community had significant concerns with earlier drafts of the curriculum. It is heartening to see that the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission were receptive to our feedback, and the recommendations approved at the IQC meeting in November were great improvements to the curriculum. While minor improvements can and should still be made, I would be proud to introduce the current iteration of this curriculum into classrooms across California.

However, there are some changes that I would like to see made to ensure the curriculum remains acceptable to many in our community:

1. Retain the new lessons that reflect California's ethnic diversity, which were added to the curriculum in November--those about Korean, Sikh, Armenian, Arab, and Jewish Americans. 2. Ensure that the curriculum does not contain BDS or antisemitism. This content was previously and rightfully removed. Definitions of antisemitism, which have been added, should remain in the curriculum. 3. Remove mentions of historical figures that engaged in antisemitic rhetoric or behavior.

In the end, an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that is done right will be a vital tool to help students build empathy and bridge divides. This greater understanding, coupled with increased representation, is key in the fight against hatred, bigotry, and white supremacy in our society at large.

Thank you for your hard work to get this curriculum to a place so many of us can be proud of. Let's get it across the finish line.

Dear State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the St

The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum correctly recognizes in its guiding principles that addressing bigotry ï¿½ including antisemitism -- is foundational to Ethnic Studies.

I appreciate that acknowledgement and that the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) are recommending that the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson be included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).

In addition to honoring this IQC recommendation, I urge the State Board of Education (SBE) to do the following:

1) Remove bias from the ESMC and treat Asian communities with proportionality and balance as California* and Federal laws and the State Board of Education's Content Standards and ESMC Guidelines require.

Move ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" (currently lesson 40) to the ""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" section to pair it with the IQC-recommended lessons that focus on Islamophobia and xenophobia of South Asians (currently lessons 33, 34 and 35) (Appendix A). This aligns with the ESMC's recommended ""thematic approach to ethnic studies"" which stresses ""the importance of identifying shared struggles."" (Preface and Chapter 3)

The Asian Studies section does not mention the lived experiences of Jewish and other non-Arab Middle Eastern Americans despite their accounting for more than 60% of California's Middle Eastern population. This section features 10 Asian ethnic groups that include Arabs and Muslims in America (from Asia and elsewhere) and offers multiple lessons that mention anti-Muslim discrimination.

Despite Judaism properly listed as a major South Asian religion (Lesson 33), this section also omits antisemitism -reminiscent of the omissions that embroiled the ESMC's first draft in controversy. Antisemitism continues to be the most prevalent religious-based hate crime in the United States and California according to FBI statistics -comprising 68% of all religious-based hate crimes targeting the Jewish 2% of the population. Anti-Muslim hate crimes comprise 12% of the religious-based hate crimes total for 1% of the population.

2) Add links to the primary sources in the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson's definitions of antisemitism. SBE's ESMC Guidelines require that the ESMC ""include access to ...primary source documents.""

3) Include the seven-minute United States Holocaust Memorial Museum video, ""Antisemitism Today"" in the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson. This video provides succinct and compelling information on contemporary antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of bigotry further enriching and reinforcing content in the Asian Studies section.



I offer my gratitude for your hard work bringing a robust Ethnic Studies curriculum that presents difficult content with nuance, sensitivity, and empathy to California's classrooms.

Sincerely,

cc Governor Gavin Newsom

There is literally nothing privileged about being a Jew in society. We have always been discriminated against and held in no different regard than any other minority race.

Our people have always lived in exile having to start over every time we are kicked out of different countries just for being Jewish.

We also write to urge the CDE to recommend ï¿½ and the State Board of Education to approve ï¿½ the following:

1. Retain the IQC's November 2020 recommendations including: ï¿½ An inclusive approach to ethnic studies, and the new lessons that better reflect California's rich ethnic diversity -- Sikhs, Hindus, Koreans, Armenians, and the diversity of Jewish Americans. ï¿½ New content that promotes a more balanced approach to ethnic studies, reminding teachers to expose students to multiple perspectives, teach students to think critically, and encourage students to form their own opinions. ï¿½ The inclusion of lesson materials on antisemitism in Ethnic Studies and particularly, the inclusion of Lesson 40 and the IHRA definition of antisemitism, the definition that is the most widely endorsed by governments, diverse religious groups, and educational institutions worldwide.

2. Remove all ESMC content that: ï¿½ Is unbalanced and inaccurate, ï¿½ pushes religious and sectarian doctrine, ï¿½ supports division, demonization, and discrimination, and ï¿½ promotes illegal, violent, and subversive people, organizations, and action.

3. Ensure that the curriculum is consistent with accepted standards of professional responsibility and the law.

The ESMC is a crucial platform that will educate students to embrace differences, build bridges, and fight bigotry ï¿½ promoting human rights and uniting our country through shared democratic values.



Thank you for your efforts to ensure an inclusive and balanced curriculum.

Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,

In recent years the Iranian-American community has faced continuous challenges, from the Muslim ban that prevents our families from traveling to the U.S., to the persistent fear of war, and a rising atmosphere of discrimination. But we are certainly not alone. In these times, studies of Orientalism, anti-Muslim racism, critical refugee studies, and our diasporan experience of colonization(s), help youth make sense of their realities. While civic engagement is crucial to our ability to make a difference, real change must also be implemented across our society. That is why I was excited for the inclusion of ethnic studies curriculum in K-12 school. But now I am appalled at the recent draft of the model curriculum - a draft that is completely devoid of the spirit and pedagogy of ethnic studies.

The West Asian community comprises a large portion of California's cultural tapestry. Los Angeles alone is home to the largest Iranian diaspora in the world. Yet the model curriculum only presents a narrow lens on our community, only choosing to focus on the Iranian Revolution and not the additional historical and sociocultural experiences that comprise our community. Our community is not the only West Asian community that is erased in this draft. I am also concerned that the recent draft removed Arab American and Pacific Islander studies, further erasing critical communities that make up California's rich diversity.

Education is a key location for marginalized people to be represented. As such, I call on the CDE to:

1. Include ""West Asian Studies"" to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to ensure that Arab, Iranian, Armenian, Palestinian, Kurdish, Afghan, Turkish, and Assyrian Americans, among others, are included.

2. Ensure that the curriculum about a community of people is made in consultation with stakeholders and ethnic studies practitioners from these communities. For example, curriculum written about the Iranian diaspora should be done in consultation, or even written by, ethnic studies practitioners from the Iranian diaspora community.

3. Restore the original draft of the ESMC and reconvene the original committee of writers and experts to revise a draft as Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.

For our own community, it is important that young Iranian Americans see themselves represented in their education. Not only as part of the diverse milieu of the American experience, but also for the contributions of Iranian history and culture to world history. Iranian Americans should be proud of their culture and history at home, as well as the culture and history of their heritage.

Our students are growing up in a world which normalizes these diverse realities. U.S. Ethnic Studies allows for and offers the tools for marginalized students to unpack and unlearn structures of power and have access to empowered education and pedagogy. Learning about the various histories of all Americans will provide our students with a complete picture of the United States and society we all share.

Sincerely,

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

I'm disheartened to hear that elected officials decided to exclude Arab Americans from California's high school ethnic studies curriculum by relegating the Arab American lesson to the appendix of the curriculum, insisting on the inclusion of extremely problematic ""perspectives"" on racism, and by not consulting experts on the revisions to the overall curriculum.

If the biggest education system in the United States decides Arab-American Studies and ethnic studies are a ""problem,"" we're going to face a dire precedent. I'm emailing you to ask that you please reject adopting these offensive revisions.

TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center This vital report found that only 2.3% of students surveyed learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. If there was ever a time that we should be protecting anti-racist education, and ensuring students learn about struggles of indigenous and racialized communities at school, as part of their formal and peer-group education it is now.

The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies. This hard-fought legacy, coming with great sacrifices from civil right and social justice movements must be honored. Arab American studies must find it rightful and powerful place in Asian American studies. Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC. Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students. And in the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.



Furthermore, the racial disparities in the impact of COVID-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as ""vectors"" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.

In these times of change and possibility, I ask that you please reject adopting the unfortunate and offensive revisions) made to this curriculum, to restore Arab-American Studies to its rightful place, and to work ethnic studies experts who have shaped this powerful and critical area of study for our students.

Dear Instructional Quality Commission,

Thank you for your latest revisions to the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, including the critical addition of sample lessons reflecting the diversity of the Jewish community. The latest draft keeps out denigrating content and features meaningful inclusion of Jewish Americans as well as an important acknowledgement of antisemitism, while still honoring the traditional four groups and their 50-year fight for inclusion.

Our community is grateful for these changes and believes they will help teachers appreciate the value of teaching about Jewish Americans in the ethnic studies classroom. However, we are concerned about efforts to reinsert divisive language and bias that doesn't belong in the classroom and that runs counter to the State Board of Education Guidelines and State Education Code.

Members of the Jewish community are common targets of extremist hatred and violence for their background and beliefs. We know that part of the antidote to this hatred lies in education about the unique contributions of Jewish Americans and the critical role antisemitism plays in white supremacy. It is equally important that antisemitism not be defined without input by the people threatened by it. Furthermore, because a significant percentage of the Jewish community is made up of people of color, individuals who experience antisemitism may also experience racism. We must acknowledge that these and other forms of oppression are not mutually exclusive.

California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will be used in thousands of classrooms, have influence in every high school statewide and will almost certainly be emulated by other states. We therefore ask that you retain Sample Lessons 40 and 41, ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" and ""Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race,"" and that you keep bias against Jews and other marginalized communities out.

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

I am are outraged that elected officials ignored tens of thousands of public comments and instead relegated Arab American lessons to an appendix of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), included extremely problematic ""perspectives"" on racism, and refused to consult Ethnic Studies experts on revisions to the curriculum.

Arab American studies must be returned to its rightful place in Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the original ESMC included Arab American studies within Asian American studies. Leading ethnic studies scholars, including Angela Davis, Robin D.G. Kelley, and the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the ESMC.

The CA Department of Education (CDE) is not living up to its mandate to create a Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum as outlined by AB2016. Since the CDE disbanded the original, highly qualified advisory committee, the ESMC has become a problematic ""All Lives Matter"" curriculum. It now bears no relationship to the values and pedagogy of Ethnic Studies. Essential Ethnic Studies terminology, including the definition of race, has been eliminated or moved to footnotes. There are now several definitions of race, including one giving credence to race as based on biology rather than social construction. The decolonial, anti-racist, and liberatory focus of Ethnic Studies has been buried in an avalanche of language about inclusion, and the experiences of Arab Americans have been erased from the curriculum.

According to TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) a 2020 report by teenage members of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, only 2.3% of student surveyed learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.

Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,

Thank you for considering comments from community members and engaging the community of Californians in the ESMC development process. It's a privilege to be able to submit these comments.

I, Rabbi Corey Helfand, a resident of California for the last decade, a US Citizen, and rabbi and spiritual leader for a Bay Area Jewish community representing more than 1000 people, appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). And at the same time, I remain deeply worried by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am a parent of students in the California school system and the rabbi and spiritual leader to hundreds of students in the California public schools. I take pride in the diversity that is California, and I am concerned that the new proposed curriculum excludes and misrepresents large groups of California's students and can fuel discrimination.

Additionally, I am an active member and leader of the Peninsula Multifaith Coalition and the Peninsula Solidarity Cohort, which brings together faith leaders and by extension thousands of different congregants of different faith backgrounds in an effort to promote peace, equality, equity, and a shared sense of understanding about each of our backgrounds. More importantly, as a faith leader and educator, I care deeply about critical thinking, deep understanding and engagement with all people. I care about this matter and I live this as a faith leader, a parent and a human being. I want an ethnic studies curriculum to succeed. More strongly, I want to be a partner with you in advocating for the passage of and success of this curriculum. We must bring Ethnic Studies to our students. And in order to do this, honestly, thoughtfully and equitably, I would be remiss in not sharing with you where there is still important and critical work to be done before this curriculum can be brought to our schools.

Here are my major concerns:

ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they:

ï¿½ do not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016 ï¿½ establish an ""us vs them"" agenda



ï¿½ are partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages ""solidarity"" and ""linkages"" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students. The guiding principles for this curriculum must be on providing prospective and opportunities for understanding. If BDS is presented (not promoted) as a change agent, than its presentation must be problematized to show the different dimensions of it and how it operates as a cover for antiSemitism.

The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC's first draft.

ï¿½ Please add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development

ï¿½ Numerous sections of the ESMC need revision to expose students to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"" and ensure that ""diverse viewpoints are respected.""

The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. We must:

ï¿½ Remove links to and advocacy of virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide

ï¿½ Include Mizrahi and other Jews of color ï¿½ Add a definition of antisemitism to address various contemporary manifestations of

antisemitism, including stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum. ï¿½ Add specific lesson materials on antisemitism, one of the fastest growing forms of hatred in the world, as a form of racism and bigotry

References to Middle Eastern communities should not favor one community over others. Teaching students ""to link"" to organizations that do not present multiple dimensions or perspectives of all parties only fuels hate instead of developing deep understanding. We must teach our students to be critical thinkers by presenting fair and unbiased information so that they may form their own opinions rather than be intentionally led down a path that perpetuates ""othering.""

The ESMC should be revised to accurately and equitably represent the cultural and racial diversity of California so it is balanced, as required by SBE standards and ESMC Guidelines

ï¿½ If the ESMC includes ethnic groups from the Middle East, it should include Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern communities proportionately. (See MENA coalition letter of communities which explains this in depth.)

ï¿½ The depiction of Jews from Arab lands dismisses the particular experience that such Jews faced in those countries. Their experience is not the same as all people from



Arab lands as they are depicted. Their experience is erased in this portion of the curriculum.

I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.

Please know, from the depths of my heart and soul, that I want support and advocate for the passage of an Ethnic Studies Curriculum for our students. It is long overdue and must be a cornerstone of our educational system. And at the same time, let's do the hard work now to get it right so that we can not only teach our students Ethnic Studies, but do so with integrity and in a way that we can be proud of.

With deepest appreciation and thanks for your support and commitment to ensuring that our children are taught that every person matters and that we are all created in God's image.

Warm regards,

From: Dary Rezvani Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 4:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies must include West Asian Studies

Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,

In recent years the Iranian-American community has faced continuous challenges, from the Muslim ban that prevents our families from traveling to the U.S., to the persistent fear of war, and a rising atmosphere of discrimination. But we are certainly not alone. In these times, studies of Orientalism, anti-Muslim racism, critical refugee studies, and our diasporan experience of colonization(s), help youth make sense of their realities. While civic engagement is crucial to our ability to make a difference, real change must also be implemented across our society. That is why I was excited for the inclusion of ethnic studies curriculum in K-12 school. But now I am appalled at the recent draft of the model curriculum - a draft that is completely devoid of the spirit and pedagogy of ethnic studies.

The West Asian community comprises a large portion of California's cultural tapestry. Los Angeles alone is home to the largest Iranian diaspora in the world. Yet the model curriculum only presents a narrow lens on our community, only choosing to focus on the Iranian Revolution and not the additional historical and sociocultural experiences that comprise our community. Our community is not the only West Asian community that is erased in this draft. I am also concerned that the recent draft removed Arab American and Pacific Islander studies, further erasing critical communities that make up California's rich diversity.

Education is a key location for marginalized people to be represented. As such, I call on the CDE to:

1. Include ""West Asian Studies"" to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to ensure that Arab, Iranian, Armenian, Palestinian, Kurdish, Afghan, Turkish, and Assyrian Americans, among others, are included.

2. Ensure that the curriculum about a community of people is made in consultation with stakeholders and ethnic studies practitioners from these communities. For example, curriculum written about the Iranian diaspora should be done in consultation, or even written by, ethnic studies practitioners from the Iranian diaspora community.

3. Restore the original draft of the ESMC and reconvene the original committee of writers and experts to revise a draft as Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.

For our own community, it is important that young Iranian Americans see themselves represented in their education. Not only as part of the diverse milieu of the American experience, but also for the contributions of Iranian history and culture to world history. Iranian Americans should be proud of their culture and history at home, as well as the culture and history of their heritage.

Our students are growing up in a world which normalizes these diverse realities. U.S. Ethnic Studies allows for and offers the tools for marginalized students to unpack and unlearn structures of power and have access to empowered education and pedagogy. Learning about the various histories of all Americans will provide our students with a complete picture of the United States and society we all share.



Sincerely, Dary Rezvani [address redacted] Fresno, CA

Dear IQC Members, I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work during this time. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.

Joey Jupiter-Levin



General Comment (followed by specifics below)

I applaud the California Department of Education (CDE) for making important and positive changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), and thank you for your hard work during this difficult time. These changes demonstrate a conscious effort to fix numerous problems in the first draft, which were highlighted in thousands of critical comments submitted by the public last year. While this new draft is clearly a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address a number of specific issues identified in the following pages.

I appreciate the removal of explicitly anti-Israel and antisemitic content from the ESMC, and the inclusion of some important references to the Jewish American experience. In light of the LA Times criticizing the first draft for, ""imposing predigested political views,"" I also applaud the addition of guidance encouraging teachers to expose students to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". Finally, I am thankful for the strong language urging school districts to be transparent and actively seek public input when they implement ethnic studies locally. Some of the comments in this document note specific positive changes which I strongly support.

That said, there are still significant areas of concern in the ESMC which must be addressed, including the following:

1. The ""Guiding Values and Principles"" of the ESMC directly reference and are partly based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to ""develop solidarity and create linkages"" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom.

2. In multiple places the language used to describe Jews and various immigrant populations from the Middle East is not inclusive enough. Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern communities should be represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans in the ESMC. There are an estimated 500,000 Californians from nonArab or non-Muslim Middle Eastern groups, who should not be simply lumped together as ""other Middle Easterners"". Similarly, references to American Jews should be edited to explicitly mention the experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Jews of color, Jews from the Former Soviet Union, and other Jewish communities in California whose stories are less widely acknowledged.

3. There are numerous sections of the ESMC where it is essential to expand upon or reinforce the importance of exposing students to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"" and ensuring that ""diverse viewpoints are respected"".

In closing, I urge the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) and CDE to make further changes to the ESMC, in order to fix problems which are described in detail below. I thank you once again for your hard work and hope you will accept my constructive feedback regarding this crucially important curriculum for our state.



Positive additions to the ESMC

Chapter 2, Page 10, Lines 239-245: I commend CDE for adding language about transparency and public input regarding the development of local ethnic studies curriculums. This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Chapter 3, Page 5, Lines 108-112: I commend CDE for adding crucial language calling for students to be exposed to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Chapter 3, Page 11, Lines 265-266: I commend CDE for urging educators to ensure that, ""diverse viewpoints are respected"". This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Appendix C, Page 119, Lines 119-130: I commend the CDE for including resources from the Anti-Defamation League and Facing History and Ourselves in the ESMC.

Positive additions to the ESMC that should be expanded upon in the next round of revisions

Chapter 3, Page 11, Lines 309-320: I commend CDE for including guidelines about what teachers need in order to ""effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues"". I strongly urge you to add one more point to this section:

ï¿½ ""Careful attention to their own political viewpoints and potential biases, to ensure students are empowered to form their own opinions rather than simply adopting the views of the teacher or particular educational materials.""

Chapter 3, Page 29, Line 780: I commend the CDE for including ""the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence"" as a topic for study in the ESMC. However, I believe this line should be edited to say ""the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence, hatred, and rhetoric"".

Jewish students in California and Jews in general have also experienced a rise in antisemitic harassment, vandalism, discrimination, and rhetoric which may not fit within the category of ""violence,"" but should still be discussed.

Chapter 3, Page 31, Line 838-839: I commend the CDE for including ""the effect that World War II and the Holocaust had upon the American Jewish population"" in the ESMC. However, I believe this should be broadened to be more representative of California's diverse Jewish immigrant communities. The following language is an example of how to do this:



ï¿½ ""Another example is the American Jewish population, including those who immigrated to California from Europe after World War II and the Holocaust, from Arab states after facing escalating oppression and violence, from Iran after the Islamic Revolution, and from the former Soviet Union after a decades-long struggle to be granted the right to leave.""

Shortcomings which should be addressed and important guidance which should be added in the next round of revisions

Key Points (followed by details below):

ï¿½ The ""Guiding Values and Principles"" of the ESMC directly reference and are partly based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to ""develop solidarity and create linkages"" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom.

o The relevant section of Education at War also states, ""Schools are battlefields where war is waged...""

ï¿½ The experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Iranians, Kurds, Assyrian-Christians and other immigrant communities must be represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans in the ESMC. They should not be simply lumped together as, ""Arab Americans and other Middle Easterners"". The current language unwittingly reflects a long history and ongoing reality of imperialist oppression and erasure of non-Arab and non-Muslim ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East.

ï¿½ References to American Jews should be edited to explicitly mention the experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Jews of color, Jews from the Former Soviet Union, and other Jewish communities in California whose stories are less widely acknowledged.

ï¿½ Guidelines should be added or reinforced to ensure that ethnic studies courses focus on giving students a depth of understanding about ethnic groups, social issues, and civic engagement, rather than promoting specific political viewpoints, ideologies, or movements.

Chapter 1, Page 9, Lines 179-194: The ""Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies"" should be edited to very explicitly define the terms used and clarify the guiding values and principles of the curriculum. For example, value and principle #6 is to ""connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels"". What is the definition of ""resistance movements"" in this section and which specific movements should teachers and students connect themselves to? The lack of clarity



leaves the door open to interpretations that will be harmful when the ESMC is used in classrooms. This concern is not simply theoretical. While the ESMC does not define the terms used in the ""Guiding Values and Principles"", it does have footnotes showing where the language comes from. Footnote #20 references a chapter called Pedagogies of Resistance, from the book Education at War. Pedagogies of Resistance includes a section titled ""Connecting Ourselves to Historical and Contemporary Resistance Movements That Struggle for Social Justice on the Global and Local Levels,"" which matches value and principle #6 in the ESMC.

Which ""resistance movements"" does it suggest teachers and students should connect themselves to? Pedagogies of Resistance explains that educators should ""develop solidarity and create linkages,"" with other movements, referring directly to works (Maira and Shihade 2006 & Spade 2011) which promote anti-Zionism, BDS and one-sided anti-Israel narratives (see below for details).

While this may have been unintentional, it is deeply problematic that the very Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC reference a book which promotes ""solidarity and linkages"" with anti-Zionism and BDS. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom.

Excerpt from Pedagogies of Resistance

- Maira and Shihade 2006 calls Israel a ""settler-colonial' state - terminology which erases over 3,000 years of Jewish history, identity, and rights in the historic home of the Jewish people. It also falsely accuses Israel of ""annexation of the West Bank and Gaza"" in 1967. In fact, Israel did not annex these territories after the 1967 War.

Most critically in regards to Principle #6, Maira and Shihade call for ""Grappling with ways to connect anti-Zionism in the context of Middle East politics to anti-racist and antiimperialist movements in the U.S."" That is, they advocate for connecting an ideology opposed to Israel's existence with subjects covered in the ESMC.



Maira and Shihade also attack the ADL, an organization that the CDE has committed to partnering with on an antisemitism curriculum. Lastly, Maira and Shihade tokenize a small minority of Jews in order to advance the notion that opposing Israel's existence is not a form of antisemitism. This erases the voices of the vast majority of Jews, who believe that opposing Israel's existence is, in fact, a form of antisemitism.

Maira and Shihade attempt to use the framework of ""anti-racism"" and ""anti-colonialism"" to shield themselves and others from being criticized for rhetoric which denies the right of Jews to self-determination, while supporting that exact same right for Palestinians.

This approach fundamentally conflicts with Guiding Value and Principle #1: ""cultivate empathy... self-determination, and the holistic well-being of all participants"".

- Spade 2011 promotes the ""Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israeli apartheid"" - the type of one-sided anti-Israel advocacy that was widely criticized in the first draft of the ESMC.

Other parts of Education at War include additional one-sided references to Israel and public discourse about it.

The book refers to Israel as a ""settler project"" (p. 244) - terminology which erases over 3,000 years of Jewish history, identity, and rights in the historic home of the Jewish people.

Steven Salaita is described as innocently, ""using Twitter to criticize Israel's 2014 siege on Gaza,"" in reference to numerous hateful statements he made, such as:

 ""I think of all the pain Israelis have caused, their smugness, their greed, their violence, and yet I smile, because it's all only temporary.""

 ""Understand that whenever a Zionist frets about Palestinian violence, it is a projection of his own brute psyche.""

 ""I wish all the fucking West Bank settlers would go missing."" (posted after three Israeli teens were kidnapped and murdered).

Such biased content should not be part of the reference point for the ESMC's Guiding Values and Principles.

Chapter 1, Page 9, Line 194: Related to the previous comment, the pages in Pedagogies of Resistance referenced in Footnote #20 include the following line:



 ""The United States is war. Schools are battlefields where war is waged, and the fight is between the imperial and the colonized, white supremacy and antiracism, and dominance and resistance.""

Is this part of the vision that will now guide the ESMC and even the State of California's education system?

If so, this should be clearly stated within the ESMC so that Californians can decide if we agree with this vision or not. If describing schools as ""battlefields where war is waged"" does not align with the ESMC's values and goals, that should be clarified. This example illustrates the crucial importance of revising the ""Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies"".

Chapter 3, Page 7, Lines 177-196: It is very important for this section to include clearer guidance about the role of educators in student community engagement projects. LAUSD's ethnic studies instructional materials include valuable guidelines that should be incorporated:

 ""An ethnic studies course should provide students with depth of understanding in relation to ethnic and social issues, rather than promoting specific political activism, demonstration, protest or the like. Ethnic studies is a scientific inquiry of ethnic groups and their interrelations (Yang, 2010, pg. 14).""

 ""An Ethnic Studies course:  Should include examples of civic engagement (e.g., voting and other peaceful social justice activities) and the impact they have had on United States history. Students who are considering volunteering, social justice activities, community engagement, etc., should consult with their school teacher/advisor and parents/guardians to evaluate that the activities are lawful, peaceful, and nonviolent.

 ""Whenever possible, should [create] opportunities for participation and for reflection on the responsibilities of citizens in a free society"" (History Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016, p. 19).""

Chapter 3, Page 20, Lines 527-528:



""the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners"" should be edited to specifically name other Middle Eastern immigrant populations that have explicitly asked for inclusion in the ESMC. This could be done as follows:

ï¿½ ""the unique experiences of Middle Eastern populations such as Arabs, Mizrahi Jews, Iranians, Kurds, Coptic-Christians, Yezidis, and others""

The Middle Eastern immigrant communities that have asked to be represented in the curriculum include:

 Mizrahi Jews  Iranians  Kurds  Assyrian-Christians  Coptic-Christians  Yezidis  Baha'is  Zoroastrians

These diverse communities represent ""an estimated combined total population of over 500,000, or at least 60%, of the Middle Eastern diasporic population in California"". They should not be simply lumped together using the term ""other Middle Easterners"".

Overall, it is essential that these groups be represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans in the ESMC. Otherwise, the ESMC will unwittingly reproduce a long history and ongoing reality of imperialist oppression and erasure of non-Arab and nonMuslim ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East.

While it is good that ""Assyrians and Jews"" are mentioned in line 607 of this chapter, this is not sufficient because they are not identified as Middle Eastern immigrant communities or presented on an equal basis with Arab Americans.

Appendix A, Page 6, Line 8166-67: While it is important to acknowledge the times when Jewish and Irish immigrants and their descendants faced significant discrimination, the following assignment is problematic for reasons given below:

""Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege.""

1) The assumption in this sentence flattens out the Jewish experience in the U.S. by casting all Jews as white. This disregards the diversity within the American Jewish community, which includes Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from Arab countries, Iran and other Muslim majority states where Jews fled persecution. It also ignores Sephardic Jews, Black Jews, Latino Jews and the emerging Jewish-



identified descendants of Spanish Jews whose ancestors were forced to convert to Christianity and flee the Inquisition. 2) It ignores the experience of ""white"" Jews (mostly from Eastern Europe) who are specifically targeted today by ""white nationalists"" for violence, such as the synagogue attacks in Pittsburgh, PA and Poway, California. The victims were murdered because of the perpetrators' perceptions that they are non-white and are enemies of the ""white race."" 3) This is significant given that the Holocaust is still in living memory of many Ashkenazi Jews, and its traumas passed on to 2nd and 3rd generation descendants. To be experiencing neo-Nazi violence of this type in 21st century America is particularly traumatizing.

Irish Americans today do not face this kind of violence by white supremacists.

Appendix A, Page 6, Line 8159-69: Given the problems listed in the previous comment, this should not be the only example of a unit covering the experiences of Jewish Americans that teachers have access to in the ESMC. At minimum, the following educational materials should be included or referenced in the curriculum:

 Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews, 9ï¿½12 ï¿½ Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era ï¿½ Working Definition of Antisemitism

Appendix B, Page 6, Lines 287-302: This section should include references to Chapter 3, Page 5 where it says students should be exposed to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". It should also reference Chapter 3, Page 11 regarding respect for diverse viewpoints and guidelines to ""effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues"".

These guidelines should be referenced specifically to address the possibility that a movement chosen by a teacher or student has faced criticism that students should consider, including from individuals, organizations, intellectuals, and leaders who are part of various ethnic minority groups.

Appendix B, Page 41 Defining ""interpersonal racism"" as something only white people do would prevent a full understanding of interpersonal oppression and potentially decrease accountability for individuals from other communities who engage in various forms of interpersonal hate. For example, individuals from many different backgrounds engage in antisemitism targeting Jews from many different backgrounds. Language about racism by white people against people of color should certainly remain in this section, with edits to ensure that other forms of interpersonal hate are acknowledged as well.

Talking Points for Emails to IQC on Ethnic Studies Curriculum

Directions:

1. Introduce yourself (""Hi, my name is Robin Rosenblatt, and I live in Sebastopol"") 2. Select any/as many of the talking points below and either copy/paste them into the body of the email or use them to write your own commentary. 3. Send the email to: ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov

Talking Points:

1. I commend the CDE for including ""the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence"" as a topic for study in the ESMC. I believe this should be edited to say ""the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence and hatred"", to ensure discussions include antisemitic harassment, vandalism, discrimination, and rhetoric which may not fit within the category of ""violence"". (Page 20, Lines 527-528)

2. Instead of providing clear definitions for the terms mentioned in the ""Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies"", the ESMC includes footnotes for educators to delve deeper into the sources of such terms on their own. Sources mentioned include Maira and Shihade (2006) and Spade (2011), which lead educators to connect social movement principles with the BDS movement. This citation



refers to Israel as a ""Settler-colonial"" state, connects anti-Zionism in the Middle East to anti-racism and anti-imperialist movements in the U.S., and attacks the CDE's partner organization, the ADL.

By not accurately defining these terms within the ESMC, educators will follow the terminology of these problematic references mentioned in the citations, ultimately promoting the hateful content originally removed from the first draft of the ESMC. (Page 9, Lines 179-194).

3. I commend CDE for adding language about transparency and public input regarding the development of local ethnic studies curriculums as well as encouraging the exploration of ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". I urge you to strongly emphasize this point in communications to local schoolboards as well as communicate that educators refrain from conveying their own political views and potential biases. (Pages 5, 10, 11)

4. ""Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege."" (Page 6, Line 8166-67)

1.Targeted Jewish communities all across America are currently dealing with antisemitism through the spread of the belief that Jews are responsible for racial and financial inequalities in America. Such a chapter falsely representing the Jewish American narrative would only promote such antisemitic rhetoric and instill such ideology. 2. This prompt leads students to the assumption that all Jews are white, rather than taking into consideration the vast Mizrahi Jewish immigrant population that hailed from Arab countries as a result of persecution as well as Black Jews, Spanish Jews, Latino Jews, and Jews form North Africa. 3. Also, the reference to ""white"" Jews (those from Eastern Europe) does not mention that these very ""white"" Jews are still targeted today in the U.S. by white nationalists and other groups who carry out antisemitic violence. The victims of recent synagogue attacks were murdered because of the perpetrators' perceptions that they are non-white and are enemies of the ""white race."" Irish Americans today do not face this kind of violence by white supremacists.

5. ""the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners"" should include Mizrahi Jews. By not doing so the ESMC will be erasing the narrative of non-Arab and non-Muslim ethnic and religious groups from the Middle East who form the Middle Eastern immigrant communities in



America. (Page 20, Lines 527-528)

6. Given the problems listed above, this should not be the only example of a unit covering the experiences of Jewish Americans that teachers have access to in the ESMC. At minimum, the following materials should be included as well: (Page 6, Lines 8159-69)

Tereza Kazanjian [address redacted] Woodland Hills, CA

August 25, 2020

Dear California Department of Education,

I call on the CDE to hear the voices of Armenian Californians and reflect our histories and experiences in California public education. Scholars estimate Armenian-Americans represent up to 500,000 people in California, with the greatest population of Armenians outside of Armenia residing in California.

I write to you today firmly in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, the calls of Asian American scholars to include West Asian American Studies, and the inclusion of Armenian-Americans within that curriculum.

The students in California do not currently see themselves and their experiences reflected in curricula. ArmenianAmericans have long histories of racialization, immigration, refugeehood, as well as legal, educational and linguistic marginalization. Ethnic Studies helps young students make sense of their realities. Our students deserve ""culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining"" (ESMC 2).

Don&#039;t cut us out. I urge you to hear community voices calling for the inclusion of West Asian American experiences within Ethnic Studies, and the necessity of Armenian-American histories within that experience.

Sincerely, Tereza Kazanjian

I would like to thank you and your team for your recent statement condemning the California Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum.

However, as a community member I am still deeply concerned that similar biases will arise in future curriculum. I am urging you to ensure that any future materials brought forward be inclusive of Jewish and Israeli-American students, their heritage and identity, and bar any anti-Israel and antisemitic sentiments which may marginalize them.

In addition, I ask that you respectfully consider removing the currently proposed curriculum from the California Department of Education website. Each day that the file is available does more damage to the educational environment. As it has already been announced that the curriculum will change, this unacceptable material should no longer be available to influence the public.

I am very concerned by the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.

I used to live in California, and although I don't anymore, I have seen California set a precedent that can have repercussions elsewhere. I am very concerned about the curriculum as it stands now.

I think it would be a serious error to exclude Jews from those listed as oppressed groups that are featured in this curriculum. Jews endured the largest genocide of the 20th century and have been the largest religious group to experience bias and hate crimes based on religion in the last 3 years (according to FBI statistics). I am also under the impression that this curriculum includes anti-Semitic tropes, one-sided BDS bias, and demonization of Israel. The Jewish people have a right to self-determination, just as Palestinians and all other people do. To deny the Jews a right to a state of their own is anti-Semitic and just plain wrong.

Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,

For over 50 years, communities of color have struggled to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. Students and faculty have advocated for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a legitimate academic discipline through sit-ins, rallies and strikes. Research shows when Ethnic Studies is taught, it results in narrowing and closing of the opportunity gap for students from underserved communities. We urge you not to give in to right-wing racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, anti-progressivism, and antiintellectualism that does not respect the languages, histories and cultural backgrounds of students of color. Students should be given the opportunity to study about their ancestral roots to better understand the present, and be able to imagine a brighter, more just and equitable future for California, the US, and the world.

In response to your call for public comment on the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, I am submitting the following input:

Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel. The following are specific examples of problems with the curriculum:

 A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, ""establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions"". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

 The sample lesson plans for the curriculum: o Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). o Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). o Use unclear language that implies ""Israel-Palestine"" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). o Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). o Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public - a common antisemitic slur (p. 256, 264-269).

 The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, ""The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."" Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

I strongly urge you to remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

I'm writing to you as a CA resident and a very worried mom for teenage kids in high school.

The Department of Education California is creating a new ethnic studies curriculum. The curriculum does not recognize Jews as a minority in the US. Furthermore, it calls for boycotting Israel (in 3 different classes), attempt to explain the conflict in the middle east using a singlesided story, encourage aggression against Israelis, and spread hate against Israelis and Jews.

We had over +200 mass shootings this year. Almost all of them directed towards minorities and many of them - directed towards Israelis and Jews. I would not be able to sleep at night if I ever hear that the next shooter learned that ""Jews are bad"" in these classes - I hope you wouldn't either.

I will be terrified to send my kids to school knowing that their fellow students are taught that Israelis, Jews (or African American or Latinos or Muslims) - are bad and we should boycott them.

I hear of school bullying because of ethnicity is on the rise. I tear when I see a mass shooting in a synagogue. I also tear when I see mass shooting in a mosque.

I don't know why the people that wrote the curriculum want to spread hate. In a program for ethnic studies more than anything. The last thing we need in California and the US in general - is more hate. We need more love. More respect. To all people and all minorities. So both you and I can send our kids to school and feel safe.

There are 1.2 million Jews living in California, 300,000 are Israeli-Americans and all of them can be directly affected if we spread hate against Jews and Israelis. My children will have a much higher chance to get bullied just because they are Jewish. Is that the education system we want to build in CA?

If you really do care about the safety of our children - please act now. You are my public representative and I trust you would do so. Can you please help?

8-15-19 Group Concern ESMC parrots BSD_embedded.txt,First Field Review (June - August 2019)_embeddedText,"The California Department of Education received an additional 169 submissions of the comment below. Other identical comments may have been posted separately.

Dear CA Department of Education Ethnic Studies Public Comment,

I am writing regarding California's Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission's proposed ethnic studies model curriculum.

As requested by your public comment form, I have concerns with the following content:

The glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, ""establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions"".

It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

This definition is not only entirely one-sided but its inclusion elevates a fringe perspective against Israel into the mainstream and entirely politicizes the national origin of a major California community of Israeli-American immigrants. No other nation or national origin is subject to the same treatment in the model curriculum. Most disturbingly, the model curriculum's definition of BDS in its current form is akin to defining the Ku Klux Klan as a social movement that promotes free speech and free expression while ignoring the organization's racist underpinnings.

The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:

Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).

Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

Use unclear language that implies ""Israel-Palestine"" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).

Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).

Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).



The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, ""The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."" Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

We respectfully request that the proposed ethnic studies curriculum take California's diverse communities and perspectives into account through a revision of the current model. Drawing from your own glossary, the ""master narrative"" advanced in the current model curriculum only serves to marginalize and disenfranchise California's immigrant population from Israel and this is not acceptable.

I also want to thank the California legislature, in particular, the California Legislative Jewish Caucus for their time and attention on this matter.

Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education:

I am concerned about the latest draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), which continues to be based on critical race theory.

Critical race theory divides students by race into oppressor and oppressed groups, creating a discriminatory, hostile, and disempowering classroom environment for students. Critical race theory states that racism is permanent and rejects principles of objectivity, neutrality, and equal opportunity.

Critical race theory conflicts with your obligation as State Board of Education members not to adopt instructional materials ""that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race."" (CA Education Code Section 51501).

I ask that you vote to remove critical race theory from the ESMC by:

1. Deleting the ESMC's directive for educators to learn critical race theory as a key framework and pedagogy for teaching ethnic studies. 2. Removing the ESMC's second definition of race which calls it ""a (neo)colonial...'master category' (that) break(s) down as people of color (POC) and white people."" 3. Deleting all ESMC references to ""whiteness,"" ""racial hierarchy,"" and ""racial privilege"" as well as race-specific qualifiers preceding the words ""supremacy"" and ""privilege."" 4. Removing from the ESMC resources and UC-approved course outlines that present critical race theory as the only approach to understanding race relations.

By rejecting critical race theory at your upcoming meeting in March, you will help ensure that the ESMC accomplishes the California legislature's goal -- ""preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."" (AB 2016)

Sincerely,

Reid Fujinaga Reid Fujinaga

Dear California Department of Education and State Board of Education,

I am writing to express concern about the Critical Ethnic Studies' (ES) polarizing foundation which still corrupts the ESMC - a curriculum that, rather than dividing, should build bridges among students and ethnic groups. I ask that you remove the Critical ES foundation from the Guiding Values and Principles AND the resulting lessons.

This includes:

1. Removing the indoctrinating Critical Ethnic Studies ideology from the Guiding Values and Principles.

2. Replacing the narrow Critical ES language and leading questions that assume a foregone conclusion, with broader constructive language that invites inquiry and analysis from multiple perspectives.

3. Removing content that promotes violence or victimhood, or demeans any ethnic group.

4. Replacing the narrow ideological lens that romanticizes any one-sided political, economic, militant, or separatist movement, with a balanced evaluation including both positive and negative sides of the movement or ""ism.""

5. Replacing the unvetted list of UC-approved courses in Appendix C with courses such as those of the Los Angeles Unified School District's (LAUSD), which are not based on a Critical ES approach.

I add my voice to the requests from the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. We all want a constructive Ethnic Studies curriculum, such as that of the LAUSD, which represents both contributions and struggles of ethnic groups and confronts racism, while building mutual understanding among all students and fostering balanced analysis.

Thank you for your work to date on improving the ESMC and for your thoughtful consideration of the above crucial revisions.

From: Tiffany Ho Sent: Friday, January 22, 2021 1:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

I am outraged that elected officials ignored tens of thousands of public comments and instead relegated Arab American lessons to an appendix of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), included extremely problematic ""perspectives"" on racism, and refused to consult Ethnic Studies experts on revisions to the curriculum.

Arab American Studies must be returned to its rightful place in Asian American Studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the original ESMC included Arab American Studies within Asian American Studies. Leading Ethnic Studies scholars, including Angela Davis, Robin D.G. Kelley, and the National Association of Asian American Studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American Studies in the ESMC.

The CA Department of Education (CDE) is not living up to its mandate to create a Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum as outlined by AB2016. Since the CDE disbanded the original, highly qualified advisory committee, the ESMC has become a problematic ""All Lives Matter"" curriculum. It now bears no relationship to the values and pedagogy of Ethnic Studies. Essential Ethnic Studies terminology, including the definition of race, has been eliminated or moved to footnotes. There are now several definitions of race, including one giving credence to race as based on biology rather than social construction. The decolonial, anti-racist, and liberatory focus of Ethnic Studies has been buried in an avalanche of language about inclusion, and the experiences of Arab Americans have been erased from the curriculum.

According to TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) a 2020 report by teenage members of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center, only 2.3% of students surveyed learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.

If the biggest education system in the United States decides Arab-American Studies and authentic Ethnic Studies are ""problems,"" we face a dire precedent.



In these times of change and possibility, please reject the inaccurate and offensive revisions made to this curriculum, restore Arab-American Studies to its rightful place, and re-empower the Ethnic Studies experts who have shaped this powerful and critical area of study for our students.

Thank you, Tiffany Ho [contact information redacted] San Francisco, CA United States

We also write to urge the CDE to recommend ï¿½ and the State Board of Education to approve ï¿½ the following:

1. Retain the IQC's November 2020 recommendations including: ï¿½ An inclusive approach to ethnic studies, and the new lessons that better reflect California's rich ethnic diversity -- Sikhs, Hindus, Koreans, Armenians, and the diversity of Jewish Americans. ï¿½ New content that promotes a more balanced approach to ethnic studies, reminding teachers to expose students to multiple perspectives, teach students to think critically, and encourage students to form their own opinions. ï¿½ The inclusion of lesson materials on antisemitism in Ethnic Studies and particularly, the inclusion of Lesson 40 and the IHRA definition of antisemitism, the definition that is the most widely endorsed by governments, diverse religious groups, and educational institutions worldwide.

2. Remove all ESMC content that: ï¿½ Is unbalanced and inaccurate, ï¿½ pushes religious and sectarian doctrine, ï¿½ supports division, demonization, and discrimination, and ï¿½ promotes illegal, violent, and subversive people, organizations, and action.

3. Ensure that the curriculum is consistent with accepted standards of professional responsibility and the law.

The ESMC is a crucial platform that will educate students to embrace differences, build bridges, and fight bigotry ï¿½ promoting human rights and uniting our country through shared democratic values.

Thank you for your efforts to ensure an inclusive and balanced curriculum.

State Board of Education c/o California Department of Education Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division 1430 N Street, Suite 3207 Sacramento, CA 95814 February 22, 2021 Dear State Board of Education, My name is Rukhsana Arastu. I am grateful to the California Department of Education (CDE) for its strong Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft, and its ongoing commitment to offer coursework in Ethnic Studies for California's students. In doing so, the CDE recognizes the enduring significance of race in American life, the ethical grounds of critical race theory, the necessity of offering curricula relevant to communities of color, and the critical importance of studying the ways ordinary people work towards equity, dignity, and justice. In expanding access to the critical frameworks that Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) offers, the CDE creates space for students to engage in pedagogies oriented towards building a more just world and a better future. However, I am troubled by the fact that the sample curriculum dated January 21, 2021, that focuses on the rich history of South Asian-Americans, excludes the history of PakistaniAmericans and Bangladeshi-Americans. Immigrants from this part of the world import decades of unique history, language and traditions for its ethnic Sindhi, Balochi, Punjabi, Pathan, and Bengali populations that began migrating to the United States half a century ago. The earliest recorded migrations occurred in 1899 when Punjabi workers came from what was then known as North-Western India (present-day Pakistan) for work in California, Oregon, and Washington. Migrants included those skilled in irrigation and others who worked on the railroads. As of 2015 there were 453,000 Pakistani immigrants, and their families residing in the US; with the largest numbers living in the states of New York, Texas and California. Pakistani and Bangladeshi-American children pursuing K-12 education in California must be given the opportunity to connect to ethnic heroes and important public figures who helped fight in social justice movements that aimed to establish an equitable and democratic society. The model lesson plans have been drafted by credentialed teachers in the state of California and reviewed by doctoral scholars for accuracy and completeness. I strongly urge you to accept the submission of the sample lesson plans and to incorporate them in the approved lesson plans for South Asian ethnic history. ""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" is an indispensable asset to the teaching of Ethnic Studies. I join local, statewide, and national organizations in support of the final approval of the ESMC; with the addition of the Pakistani-American and Bangladeshi-American lesson plans to



the AAPI Unit and to the ESMC in general. With these additions, I believe California students will soon experience a curriculum that better represents the diversity of our community. Thank you. Sincerely,

Dear State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the St

The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum correctly recognizes in its guiding principles that addressing bigotry ï¿½ including antisemitism -- is foundational to Ethnic Studies.

I appreciate that acknowledgement and that the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) are recommending that the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson be included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).

In addition to honoring this IQC recommendation, I urge the State Board of Education (SBE) to do the following:

1) Remove bias from the ESMC and treat Asian communities with proportionality and balance as California* and Federal laws and the State Board of Education's Content Standards and ESMC Guidelines require.

Move ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" (currently lesson 40) to the ""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" section to pair it with the IQC-recommended lessons that focus on Islamophobia and xenophobia of South Asians (currently lessons 33, 34 and 35) (Appendix A). This aligns with the ESMC's recommended ""thematic approach to ethnic studies"" which stresses ""the importance of identifying shared struggles."" (Preface and Chapter 3)

The Asian Studies section does not mention the lived experiences of Jewish and other non-Arab Middle Eastern Americans despite their accounting for more than 60% of California's Middle Eastern population. This section features 10 Asian ethnic groups that include Arabs and Muslims in America (from Asia and elsewhere) and offers multiple lessons that mention anti-Muslim discrimination.

Despite Judaism properly listed as a major South Asian religion (Lesson 33), this section also omits antisemitism -reminiscent of the omissions that embroiled the ESMC's first draft in controversy. Antisemitism continues to be the most prevalent religious-based hate crime in the United States and California according to FBI statistics -comprising 68% of all religious-based hate crimes targeting the Jewish 2% of the population. Anti-Muslim hate crimes comprise 12% of the religious-based hate crimes total for 1% of the population.

2) Add links to the primary sources in the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson's definitions of antisemitism. SBE's ESMC Guidelines require that the ESMC ""include access to ...primary source documents.""

3) Include the seven-minute United States Holocaust Memorial Museum video, ""Antisemitism Today"" in the ""Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans"" lesson. This video provides succinct and compelling information on contemporary antisemitism, Islamophobia, and other forms of bigotry further enriching and reinforcing content in the Asian Studies section.

I offer my gratitude for your hard work bringing a robust Ethnic Studies curriculum that presents difficult content



with nuance, sensitivity, and empathy to California's classrooms.

Sincerely,

Jeff Abramowitz

Hi my name is Omri and I live in West Hills, CA.

Talking Points:

ï¿½ Issue of Transparency o fully transparency is expected where it is supposed to be given in curriculum

development and implementation o Unfortunately, we have felt a breech in this supposed-to-be communicative

relationship when we were sprung with last-minute decisions. o The announcement of an additional chapter was announced just hours prior to the

IQC meeting on August 13th. o The public commenting period which commences on September 1, is meant to give

the community the opportunity to provide feedback on any issues it has with the curriculum prior to its final round of revisions. o However, how can we do so if we are not given this supplemental content in time? Why is it being hidden? These factors only further my community's uneasiness to the intentions behind it. I am worried this chapter will be the source of more BDS.

ï¿½ Problematic Citations o Many of the citations in this curriculum are from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel

authors. o Raises concerns on what teachers will find when they use the sources for

supplemental content

ï¿½ American Jews Chapter o compares American Jews to Irish Americans o teaches how Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnicity. o terrifying as a Jew due to the rise in antisemitism during the last year because Jewish

Americans are compared to white supremacists and blames Jews for racial injustice in America. o Jews have never stopped being discriminated against, hated, and of course, the target of several violent and deathly attacks. o For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the targeted hatred we experience.



CALL TO ACTION I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by 1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS!!

Dear California Department of Education,

It is exciting to see that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is moving forward. I do believe that a required course in Ethnic Studies has the potential to improve cross cultural understanding and to address the racism that we are witnessing throughout the United States. While there are many diverse Asian groups in America, I believe the coverage of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum needs to be extended to include more Asian communities that live throughout California. I am particularly concerned that Korean American study has been excluded.

The Korean American community has long helped shape the American landscape through its community activities, its contributions, and more. For example, we can't discuss the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest without including Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose during that period and how this contributed to the violence and marginalization of minority groups. It implies a significant lesson for unity and solidarity among minority groups. It was also a turning point for many Korean Americans to realize the importance of civic engagement. Korean American Experiences and Interethnic Relations would be a very powerful topic for California students to learn how to cooperate with each other in the diverse community of California.

Korean American community's presence, impact, and history are significant and an important part of ethnic studies education. To not include the Korean American community in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum would be to ignore a major part of California's and America's heart and soul. Thus, I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian



American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans is yet again another marginalization and discriminatory action. Thank you for your time.

Dear Tony Thurmond,

Dear Superintendent Thurmond,

It has come to my attention that the proposed Sample Lessons and Topics as found in Appendix B of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum does not include a detailed history of the Japanese American community as one of the supplied sample lesson plans. The current draft of the curriculum outline has reduced the Japanese American experience down to a few bullet points under the list of additional sample topics. The lack of a full sample lesson on Japanese American experiences, will mean that those subjects will not be taught by teachers.

The Japanese American community has been an integral part of California history; from the farmers who made the ""unfarmable"" land flourish with produce, to the activists who challenged the supreme court against the incarceration of 120,000 people based of their race. This story is one that is of tremendous national significance, but is also a very uniquely California story as the majority of Japanese Americans incarcerated during the war had been living in California. Two incarceration sites, Tule Lake and Manzanar are located in California, and especially noteworthy. Even within the listing of additional sample topics, for someone unfamiliar, terms such as Hapa and Gidra may be unidentifiable, and never be covered unless included as a part of a broader lessonon the Japanese American experience.

The current outline also leaves out the Vietnamese American, Korean American, and South Asian American groups as well as many others. I understand that the first draft of sample curriculums also included one on Pan-Asian studies and that has been removed from the most recent draft. I urge you to return that as a sample lesson plan. These are all critical to our Asian American history, and to leave this section out would be a disservice to the children who don't understand what it means to be Asian American. As Asian Americans continue to be the target of racism and often times bullying in schools, maintaining Asian American history in the curriculum, and recognizing the diversity of Asian American experience, is absolutely necessary.

I hope that you will ensure that the sample curriculums provided will be more comprehenzive and detailed in its coverage of Asian American diversity.

Sincerely,

I am concerned that after being pressured by organizations trying to restore BDS and antisemitism to the curriculum, the CDE has added a chapter that is not open to review. I welcome an Arab-American lesson, but not one guided by the hand of BDS radicals and hidden from the public. The protocol of allowing the public to review the curriculum and comment on it allows constituents to hold the CDE to its commitment against discrimination, as promised when revising the first draft. I ask that the CDE stand by its previous pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum, and to open the additional sample chapter up to fair and transparent review prior to the closing of the comment period on September 30th.

To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:

To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:

In August 2019 and again in July 2020, eleven Middle Eastern Jewish organizations based primarily in San Francisco and Los Angeles, urged the State of California to include Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and I am writing to you today to amplify this request.

By including only the experience of the dominant ethnic ï¿½ religious group from the Middle East, an Arab American lesson plan will fail to promote rigorous analysis of history, systems of oppression, and the status quo in an effort to generate discussions on futurity, and imagine new possibilities. The inclusion of diverse Middle EasternAmerican experiences, like antisemitism, is essential for a full and rich understanding of Middle Eastern American identity, and is required by CDE's principles, guidelines, standards, and laws.

As a concerned Jewish American, I am writing to share four core principles that I ask you to consider in the development of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I believe these principles are vitally important in producing an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that is representative, balanced, free of bias and adhering to the guidelines and standards of California's Department of Education.

1) I believe it is critical that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) focuses on the lived experiences of Middle Eastern and North African Jews IN North America, many of whom have been racialized and have experienced various forms of bigotry. The ESMC should make clear that under the ""broadly defined umbrella of Asian Studies"" are Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) groups which represent ~60% of California's MENA population but whose stories have been excluded from the ESMC.

2) At a time when there is great need to provide our students with high-quality educational content related to bigotry, it is essential to incorporate adequate instructional material on antisemitism ï¿½ not just simplistic references to it. I would like to see the next draft of the curriculum include the lesson plan, ""Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews"", as it will provide students with high-quality instruction on contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience.

3) The State of California must draw clear redlines against antisemitism and discrimination. The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum must not include the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement, and other highly politicized conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts that create unsafe classrooms for Jewish and Middle Eastern minority students throughout California.

4) The State of California must uphold its promise of transparency and public input in reviewing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. We are deeply troubled by the CDE's recommendation that the public will not be allowed their rightful opportunity to review and comment on any new Arab American Studies lesson plan or content to be added



to the curriculum, per standard procedure as defined in AB2016.

Thank you,

Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic Studies,

Ethnic Studies must be inclusive, and not an excuse to further erase the voices of Arab Americans. Arab American studies as a core part of the Asian American studies curriculum is not only essential but a moral imperative. An outcome that excludes or casts aside this vulnerable community will further diminish a voice that is already underrepresented. If Arab Americans are not registered we become unsafe and unable to contribute to our society like other Americans.

Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:

As a California state resident and mother, I would like my voice heard regarding the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum:

1. Any lesson plan on ethnic groups in California should include Jewish Americans, and recognize the diversity of Jews in national origin and background as we might discuss for say Asian Americans.

2. Ensure any Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum lesson plan includes anti-semitism as a historical and current example of bigotry; and include an accurate definition of anti-semitism, which reflects the depth and breadth of hate against Jews in more subtle forms including the de-legitimization of Israel and denial of the Holocaust. The ADL includes resources for lesson plans on anti-semitism here: https://antisemitism.adl.org/

3. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. How can you create a curriculum on our ethnic groups without providing them a voice in its development?

From: HJ W Sent: Thursday, September 10, 2020 2:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] please add Korean American history.

Dear California Department of Education,

While it's exciting to see that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is moving forward and students will have the opportunity to learn about our diverse community, I'm deeply concerned that Korean American studies has been excluded.

The Korean American community has long helped shape the American landscape through its community activities, its contributions, and more. For example, we can't discuss the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest without including Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose during that period and how this contributed to the violence and marginalization of Asian Americans. Korean Americans including Dr. Sammy Lee and Col. Young Oak Kim also helped form this country through their actions, valor, and character. Dr. Lee won Olympic gold for America in 1948 and 1952 and was the first Asian American man to do so. Col. Kim was a U.S. Army officer who became the first Asian American to lead a combat battalion on the field during the Korean War. He was also a World War II hero. His humanitarian efforts also molded the landscape of Los Angeles through the founding of several nonprofits and organizations that help the youth, battered women, and minorities.

Korean American history and identity should be taught as part of the curriculum because this community played a major role in California and the country. An important ethnic studies lesson includes the Korean American fight for independence and recognition in the United States as not Japanese subjects. In 1913, the Hemet Valley Incident sparked a debate about the place and identity of Korean Americans in the United States. At the time, Korean Americans were viewed as Japanese subjects, but the Hemet Valley Incident changed that designation.

The incident involved about 11-15 Korean American workers who were thrown out of Hemet by white crop workers; anti-Asian and racist sentiments were high. The Japanese consulate tried to intervene on the Koreans' behalf. However, David Lee of the Korean National Association wrote a letter to then Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan and indicated that Korean Americans were not Japanese subjects. The result was Secretary Bryan declaring, in a press release, that Korean Americans were not Japanese subjects and should be treated as such in the United States. This story demonstrates just how impactful and powerful the Korean American community's history and identity is. From an ethnic studies point of view, this story alone is an important case to study as it demonstrates the impact of imperialism/colonialism on diasporic communities and their host countries.

Korean Americans continued their struggle for independence and identity by establishing the Willows Korean Aviation School/Corps in Willows, CA in 1920. The Korean Air Force views the school as its origin. The school trained Korean Americans to be combat pilots and two of the



school's graduates became Korea's first aviation officers. To understand the Korean American community, its history and ethnic identity is to also understand the framework of our country and how this great nation is made up of minority histories.

Susan Ahn Cuddy is another major Korean American figure that demonstrates why Korean American studies should be included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. She broke gender and ethnic boundaries and became the first female United States Navy gunnery officer during World War II. She was a lieutenant and helped train pilots to shoot enemies during the war. Her brothers Philip Ahn and Ralph Ahn also joined the U.S. military during World War II. Philip Ahn was a well-known actor who starred in major films and television shows including as the monk in Kung-Fu. He later earned a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Ralph Ahn, the youngest of the five Ahn children, also became an actor and is a Korean American community activist. He is the only surviving child of the Ahn children.

Susan was the eldest daughter of Korean independence activist Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and Helen Ahn. In 1902, her parents were the first married Korean couple to emigrate to the United States. Ahn and her family are well known in the Korean and Korean American community for their independence activities. Dosan Ahn Chang Ho lived in California and founded the first organized-Korean American settlement in Riverside sometime in early 1905. The Ahn family house is also still standing and is located on the University of Southern California campus. Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and his family occupy a salient place in Korean American and American history and should not be left out of ethnic studies.

Community leaders and heroines like Violet Catherine Kim who lived and worked in Riverside, CA as well, should be included in the curriculum. She was a teacher and should be recognized, studied, and taught in classes. Kim also surmounted gender stereotypes and racial boundaries during the early 1900s when she worked at March Field Air Base as a general mechanic helper and junior mechanic in 1942/1943. She also became a teacher and befriended the Japanese American Inaba family. The friendship between the Kim and Inaba families demonstrated that the spirit of humanity and friendship surpasses color lines and historic ethnic divides. Kim's story is part of what makes up the fabric of California's/America's ethnic history.

Ellen Thun is also a major Korean American figure who should be taught about in ethnic studies. She worked for the Times-Mirror Press in Los Angeles and wrote a column about her memories of the early Korean American community in the Korea Times newspaper. Thun's writings helped shed light on the Korean American community's activities and lives during the early 1900s.

Korean Americans including Kyong Won ""K.W."" Lee - he is the first Asian American to be hired by mainstream American media - should also be taught about. He is considered the godfather of Asian American journalism. Lee spearheaded the investigation into the Chol Soo Lee case while he worked for the Sacramento Union. K.W. Lee wrote hundreds of articles on the wrongful conviction of Korean American Chol Soo Lee. The stories sparked the Free Chol Soo Lee Movement. The demonstrations and protests became the first Pan-Asian movement and resulted in Chol Soo Lee's acquittal. Such a historic case should not be ignored.

Angela Oh is another remarkable Korean American who should be taught about. She is an attorney who was appointed to President Bill Clinton's ""One America Initiative in the 21st Century: The President's Initiative on Race"" advisory board in 1998. The board was tasked with engaging the American people in dialogue on race relations. She also served as a spokesperson for the Korean American community during and after the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest.



Also, California recognizes Korean Americans through two resolutions. Hangul Day was passed on October 19, 2019 and recognizes Korean Americans as ""an integral part of mainstream American society and have made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas."" California also recognized Korean American Day on January 13, 2020 by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 142 citing that ""with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans.""

From the few examples listed above, it's clear that the Korean American community's presence, impact, and history are significant and an important part of ethnic studies education. To not include the Korean American community in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum would be to ignore a major part of California's and America's heart and soul. Thus, I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans is yet again another marginalization and discriminatory action. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, Andy Won

Dear California Instructional Quality Commission,

The State Board of Education Guidelines for Ethnic Studies specify: ""Include information on the Ethnic Studies movement, specifically the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), and its significance in the establishment of Ethnic Studies as a discipline and work in promoting diversity and inclusion within higher education"". As UC Berkeley TWLF founders of Ethnic Studies over 50 years ago, and the generations which continue our legacy, we write to ask you to:

1. Update the ESMC's Third World Liberation Front section to better and more accurately reflect UC Berkeley TWLF's role in the movement and founding of Ethnic Studies, our specific UCB TWLF recommendations, beginning on Chapter 1, line 262, are included at the end of this text.

2. In your official summary of public comments, it is imperative to recognize the 25,000+ individuals signed on in support of the original ESMC draft, along with over 150 community based organizations and associations in support, with combined memberships of over 600,000 people. University Ethnic Studies departments, Education departments, and K-12 school districts across the state are also in support. Significant parts of the original draft need to be reinstated in the November 2020 iteration. https://www.change.org/p/defend-ethnic-studies-for-our-studentssave-our-curriculum-at-the-ca-dept-of-ed-now

3. Ensure all included lessons align with the Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies Teaching, which are present in the original and September 2020 draft.

Specific Recommendations for Chapter 1 TWLF section, edits integrated in text:

Beginning Line 262:

By 1968, this call was crystallized as Black Student Union members at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) began organizing around the issue. Soon after, they were joined by other students, culminating with a student strike. Inspired by youth activism and organizing in the Civil Rights, Black Liberation, American Indian, Chicano, Asian American, labor, and anti-Vietnam war movements, students at San Francisco State College embarked on a strike (November 6, 1968ï¿½March 20, 1969) demanding: (1) equal access to public education, (2) an increase in faculty of color, and (3) ""a new curriculum that would embrace the history of all people, including ethnic



minorities."" Led by the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF)--a coalition of students from the campus' Black Student Union, Latin American Student Organization (LASO), the Intercollegiate Chinese for Social Action (ICSA), the Mexican American Student Confederation, the Philippine American Collegiate Endeavor (PACE), La Raza, the Native American Students Organization, and Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA)--students refused to attend classes for five months until administrators met their demands.

At University of California (UC) Berkeley in the spring of 1968, the Afro-American Students Union (AASU) proposed a Black Studies program. The administration consistently stalled negotiations and kept deleting elements of AASU's proposal-particularly the crucial community component. AASU was joined by the MexicanAmerican Student Confederation (MASC), the Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA) and the Native American Student Union (NASU) to form the Third World Liberation Front at Berkeley. They expanded the Black Studies program to an autonomous Third World College to be comprised of Departments of Asian Studies, Black Studies, Chicano Studies, Native American Studies, and ""any other Third World studies programs as they are developed and presented."" Demands also included widespread recruitment of Third World students and hiring of Third World people in positions of power in every department and discipline, from Admissions to Finances. Third World control--self-determination involving students and communities--was to oversee all aspects of the Third World College and programs.

When UC rejected the TWLF demands, the Third World Strike began the longest and bloodiest strike in UC history--from January-March 1969. The Administration and State of California violently opposed the TWLF to the point where Governor Ronald Reagan declared ""a state of extreme emergency"" at Berkeley, with unprecedented constant sweeps and teargassing by combined forces of not only the campus police but 6 East Bay police forces, the Alameda County Sheriff's deputies, the Highway Patrol, and even the National Guard. Despite being forbidden from having any sound system or holding mass rallies and the threat of ""immediate suspension"" for protesting, TWLF strikers showed up in force everyday and organized growing multinational support both within the campus and around the country.

The first Ethnic Studies entity in the US was won at Berkeley on March 7, 1969, when UC approved an Ethnic Studies Department that would evolve into a College. Thus it was also the first African American Studies (originally Black Studies), Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies (originally called Chicano Studies), Native American Studies, and Asian American Studies (originally called Asian Studies) in the country. After AAPA had formed in May 1968--originating the term and concept of Asian American--SFSU's TWLF later broadened their original demand for separate Filipino Studies and Chinese American Studies to Asian American Studies.

On March 20, 1969 the first college of Ethnic Studies was established at San Francisco State University. Students were now able to take courses devoted to foregrounding the perspectives, histories, and cultures of African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Chicana/o/x/, Latina/o/x, and Native Americans. In early 1969, students at the University of California, Berkeley successfully launched a strike that resulted in the



creation of the first Ethnic Studies department in the country. Meanwhile, at the other end of the state, as early as 1968 students at California State University, Los Angeles and California State University, Northridge were establishing Chicano studies and Black studies departments. Soon, college students across the nation began calling for the establishment of Ethnic Studies courses, departments, and degree programs. Over 50 years after the strikes at San Francisco State College and UC Berkeley, Ethnic Studies is now a vibrant discipline with multiple academic journals, associations, national and international conferences, undergraduate and graduate degree programs, and thousands of scholars and educators contributing to the field's complexity and vitality.

Since the student movements of the 1960s, Ethnic Studies proponents have fought for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies across public schools at the Kï¿½12 level and higher education. Over the last 10 years this movement has gained substantial traction at the local level as numerous California public school districts have either passed their own Ethnic Studies graduation requirements or are implementing Ethnic Studies courses.18

At the state level, the California State Legislature has drafted and voted on several bills to help bolster support for Ethnic Studies implementation at the Kï¿½12 level, including Assembly Bill 2016, which authorized the development of this document.

Thank you for your consideration of the above.

All the best,

From: Paul Candau Sent: Thursday, September 10, 2020 9:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ACTION ALERT: Take Action for Inclusive Ethnic Studies Education

Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission ,

I write to express my serious concerns about the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum revision and urge improvements to include the following:

ï¿½ REMOVE THE CURRENT GUIDING VALUES AND ADD SAFEGUARDS AGAINST PROMOTING ONESIDED NARROW POLITICAL VIEWPOINTS IN THE CLASSROOM. Ensure that instructional materials present fair and balanced academic presentations of various points of view, rather than partisan political ideology.

Include the Balanced Curriculum Guidelines from the Los Angeles School District's Ethnic Studies programs. Remove the current ""Guiding Values"" which promote radical ideological aims such as ""transformative post-imperial resistance,"" and can be used to bring hate and bias into our classrooms. Instead, align lessons to the ""Eight Outcomes"" for Ethnic Studies which promote values such as mutual respect, understanding of others and self-empowerment for civic engagement.

ï¿½ INCLUDE THE HISTORY AND EXPERIENCE OF ETHNIC GROUPS - SUCH AS JEWS, HINDUS, KOREANS AND ARMENIANS - WHO HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE CURRICULUM, CONSISTENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE ETHNIC STUDIES APPROACH.

The California Department of Education has proposed the more narrow ""critical ethnic studies"" focus on four core groups of people of color: African-American; Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x; Native Americans; and Asian-Americans. Yet the Asian-American section is broadly construed to include lesson plans about a diverse range of groups, including Arab Americans. Given this paradigm, the curriculum should also include the experiences of the Middle Eastern Jewish communities, as well as other Middle Eastern minorities, by adding the JIMENA lesson plan to the Asian American section in Appendix B.

ï¿½ TEACH STUDENTS TO COMBAT ANTISEMITISM AND OTHER FORMS OF BIGOTRY. Ensure that students learn to combat bias, bigotry and racism by including a meaningful lesson plan about antisemitism, utilizing the most commonly accepted definition, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition, which has been internationally adopted and endorsed



by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Department of Education.

Antisemitism is rising across the country, and in California, Jews are the #1 target of religious based hate crimes and the #3 target of all ethnic based hate crimes. Jews are an ethnic group that has historically faced intense discrimination and genocide. This ethnic studies curriculum ï¿½ designed to combat discrimination and racism ï¿½ must also include lesson materials about antisemitism.

ï¿½ RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW AND ADHERE TO PRINCIPLES OF TRANSPARENCY. Instead of 11th hour tricks, implement a fair procedural review and release all aspects of the curriculum now.

We urge you to correct these deficiencies. The current version lacks cultural competency, advances a narrow political ideology, and does a great disservice to California's diverse population.

Don't be fooled. Insisting on a balanced and inclusive approach to ethnic studies does not dilute or delay this important curriculum. It strengthens and improves the ESMC to better address the issues of racial injustice and strengthen our democracy. A flawed version will do the opposite.

K-12 students across California deserve an opportunity to honestly confront racism in all its forms, build bridges of interethnic understanding, and see themselves in the curriculum. Please help get the final version right.

Sincerely, Paul Candau

9-1-20 Cohen David_embedded.txt,Second Field Review (Sept 2020)_embeddedText,"The California Department of Education received an additional 7 submissions that included the attachment on pages 2ï¿½11 below prior to the second field review.

From: David L Cohen Sent: Tuesday, September 1, 2020 12:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum

Dear IQC Members, I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.

To deliberately focus on only one group of people is hurtful to that group as well as to society as a whole. It leads to 'Saturday people followed by Sunday people'. This is counter-productive, discriminatory, and spiteful, enabling a leftist agenda rather a liberal one.



General Analysis (followed by specifics below) While the new draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is a step in the right direction, further changes must be made to address a number of significant problems that remain.

Key problems from the previous draft:

ï¿½ Promoting hate and one-sided narratives against Jews and Israel. ï¿½ Excluding numerous ethnic groups, including Jews. For additional info see

here, here, here, here, and here. ï¿½ Pushing narrow, divisive political viewpoints rather than encouraging students to

think critically and make up their own minds. For additional info see here and here.

Examples of Positive Changes in the new draft (though there are intense efforts to reverse much of this progress)

ï¿½ Explicitly anti-Israel and antisemitic content has been removed, although significant concerns remain about language and references in the new draft being used to justify teaching such bias regardless.

ï¿½ New references to the American Jewish experience and antisemitism have been included, although they do not adequately represent the diversity of the Jewish community or educate about hatred against Jews in all its forms.

ï¿½ Some guidance has been added that encourages teachers to expose students to ""multiple and often competing sources of information,"" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints. This should be expanded upon in the guiding values and principles and other parts of the curriculum.

ï¿½ Strong language has been added urging school districts to be transparent and actively seek public input when they implement ethnic studies locally.

Examples of significant problems that still need to be addressed

ï¿½ The guiding values and principles should be clarified and revised to encourage critical thinking, instead of enabling harmful political agendas. The ""Guiding Values and Principles"" of the ESMC directly reference and are based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book encourages teachers to ""develop solidarity and create linkages"" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and antiIsrael narratives. One of the ESMC's guiding values is connecting to ""resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels"" - language which can easily be twisted to justify promoting anti-Israel and antisemitic hate in the classroom.

ï¿½ The last-minute addition of a lesson plan solely focused on Arab Americans is discriminatory and lacking in transparency. The curriculum should be inclusive of all Middle Eastern communities in California, such as Jews, Iranians, Arabs, Kurds, Assyrian Christians, Coptic Christians, and others. There is no educational or moral justification for favoring one of these communities over all others. The ESMC should



be revised to add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern Americans, which goes through the same vetting process as the rest of the curriculum.

ï¿½ Existing references to American Jews should be edited to explicitly mention the experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Jews of color, Jews from the Former Soviet Union, and other Jewish communities in California whose stories are less widely acknowledged. Furthermore, a section should be added to the ESMC covering various forms of hate, including antisemitism across the political spectrum.

ï¿½ There are numerous sections of the ESMC where it is essential to expand upon or reinforce the importance of exposing students to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"" and ensuring that ""diverse viewpoints are respected"".

Positive additions to the ESMC

Chapter 2, Page 10, Lines 239-245: Strong language added about transparency and public input regarding the development of local ethnic studies curriculums. This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Chapter 3, Page 5, Lines 108-112: Crucial language added calling for students to be exposed to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Chapter 3, Page 11, Lines 265-266: Crucial language added urging educators to ensure that, ""diverse viewpoints are respected"". This point should be strongly emphasized in communications about the ESMC.

Appendix C, Page 119, Lines 119-130: Great resources from the Anti-Defamation League and Facing History and Ourselves have been added to the ESMC.

Positive additions to the ESMC that should be expanded upon in the next round of revisions

Chapter 3, Page 11, Lines 309-320: Strong guidelines added about what teachers need in order to ""effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues"". This section should be strengthened further by adding one more important point:

ï¿½ ""Careful attention to their own political viewpoints and potential biases, to ensure students are empowered to form their own opinions rather than simply adopting the views of the teacher or particular educational materials.""



Chapter 3, Page 29, Line 780: The, ""recent rise in anti-Semitic violence"" has been added as a topic for study in the ESMC. This positive addition should be edited to say:

ï¿½ ""the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence, hatred, and rhetoric"".

Jewish students in California and Jews in general have also experienced a rise in antisemitic harassment, vandalism, discrimination, and rhetoric which may not fit within the category of ""violence,"" but should still be discussed.

Chapter 3, Page 31, Line 838-839: The ESMC now includes ""the effect that World War II and the Holocaust had upon the American Jewish population"". This positive addition should be broadened to be more representative of California's diverse Jewish immigrant communities. The following language is an example of how to do this:

ï¿½ ""Another example is the American Jewish population, including those who immigrated to California from Europe after World War II and the Holocaust, from Arab states after facing escalating oppression and violence, from Iran after the Islamic Revolution, and from the former Soviet Union after a decades-long struggle to be granted the right to leave.""

Shortcomings which should be addressed and important guidance which should be added in the next round of revisions

Preface, Page 5, Lines 95-98: The Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) rightly fought for the just cause of including communities of color in higher education, and at the same time espoused deeply harmful ideas and ideologies in other areas. For example, one of the most prominent leaders of TWLF gave a speech in 1968 in which he, ""attacked Jewish people as exploiters of the Negroes in America and South Africa and called for `victory to the Arab people' over Israel,"" according to a news report from that period. TWLF also drew significant inspiration from Mao Zedong, the communist dictator of China who was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people. The State Board of Education's General Principles should be revised to ensure the ESMC educates about the TWLF accurately and comprehensively, so students come away understanding that TWLF and other movements can promote good ideas about some issues and bad ideas about others.

Chapter 1, Page 9, Lines 179-194: The ""Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies"" should be clarified and revised. For example, value and principle #6 is to ""connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels"".

What is the definition of ""resistance movements"" in this section and which specific movements should teachers and students connect themselves to? The lack of clarity



leaves the door open to interpretations that will be harmful when the ESMC is used in classrooms. This concern is not simply theoretical. While the ESMC does not define the terms used in the ""Guiding Values and Principles"", it does have footnotes showing where the language comes from. Footnote #20 references a chapter called Pedagogies of Resistance, from the book Education at War. Pedagogies of Resistance includes a section titled ""Connecting Ourselves to Historical and Contemporary Resistance Movements That Struggle for Social Justice on the Global and Local Levels,"" which matches value and principle #6 in the ESMC. Which ""resistance movements"" does it suggest teachers and students should connect themselves to? Pedagogies of Resistance explains that educators should ""develop solidarity and create linkages,"" with other movements, referring directly to works (Maira and Shihade 2006 & Spade 2011) which promote anti-Zionism, BDS and one-sided anti-Israel narratives (see below for details). While this may have been unintentional, it is deeply problematic that the very Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC reference a book which promotes ""solidarity and linkages"" with anti-Zionism and BDS. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom.

Excerpt from Pedagogies of Resistance - Maira and Shihade 2006 calls Israel a ""settler-colonial' state - terminology which erases over 3,000 years of Jewish history, identity, and rights in the historic home of the Jewish people. It also falsely accuses Israel of ""annexation of the West Bank and Gaza"" in 1967. In fact, Israel did not annex these territories after the 1967 War. Most critically in regards to Principle #6, Maira and Shihade call for ""Grappling with ways to connect anti-Zionism in the context of Middle East politics to anti-racist and anti-



imperialist movements in the U.S."" That is, they advocate for connecting an ideology opposed to Israel's existence with subjects covered in the ESMC.

Maira and Shihade also attack the ADL, an organization that the CDE has committed to partnering with on an antisemitism curriculum.

Lastly, Maira and Shihade tokenize a small minority of Jews in order to advance the notion that opposing Israel's existence is not a form of antisemitism. This erases the voices of the vast majority of Jews, who believe that opposing Israel's existence is, in fact, a form of antisemitism. Maira and Shihade attempt to use the framework of ""antiracism"" and ""anti-colonialism"" to shield themselves and others from being criticized for rhetoric which denies the right of Jews to self-determination, while supporting that exact same right for Palestinians.

This approach fundamentally conflicts with Guiding Value and Principle #1: ""cultivate empathy... self-determination, and the holistic well-being of all participants"".

- Spade 2011 promotes the ""Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israeli apartheid"" - the type of one-sided anti-Israel advocacy that was widely criticized in the first draft of the ESMC.

Other parts of Education at War include additional one-sided references to Israel and public discourse about it.

The book refers to Israel as a ""settler project"" (p. 244) - terminology which erases over 3,000 years of Jewish history, identity, and rights in the historic home of the Jewish people.

Steven Salaita is described as innocently, ""using Twitter to criticize Israel's 2014 siege on Gaza,"" in reference to numerous hateful statements he made, such as:

 ""I think of all the pain Israelis have caused, their smugness, their greed, their violence, and yet I smile, because it's all only temporary.""

 ""Understand that whenever a Zionist frets about Palestinian violence, it is a projection of his own brute psyche.""

 ""I wish all the fucking West Bank settlers would go missing."" (posted after three Israeli teens were kidnapped and murdered).

Such biased content should not be part of the reference point for the ESMC's Guiding Values and Principles.

Chapter 1, Page 9, Line 194: Related to the previous comment, the pages in Pedagogies of Resistance referenced in Footnote #20 include the following line:



 ""The United States is war. Schools are battlefields where war is waged, and the fight is between the imperial and the colonized, white supremacy and antiracism, and dominance and resistance.""

Is this part of the vision that will now guide the ESMC and even the State of California's education system?

If so, this should be clearly stated within the ESMC so that Californians can decide if we agree with this vision or not. If describing schools as ""battlefields where war is waged"" does not align with the ESMC's values and goals, that should be clarified. This example illustrates the crucial importance of revising the ""Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies"".

Chapter 1, Page 9, Lines 179-194: The Guiding Values and Principles should be revised to include the following language:

ï¿½ At the college and university level, ethnic studies courses are sometimes taught from a specific political point of view. In K-12 education it is imperative that students are exposed to multiple perspectives, taught to think critically, and form their own opinions.

Chapter 3, Page 7, Lines 177-196: It is very important for this section to include clearer guidance about the role of educators in student community engagement projects. LAUSD's ethnic studies instructional materials include valuable guidelines that should be incorporated:

 ""An ethnic studies course should provide students with depth of understanding in relation to ethnic and social issues, rather than promoting specific political activism, demonstration, protest or the like. Ethnic studies is a scientific inquiry of ethnic groups and their interrelations (Yang, 2010, pg. 14).""

 ""An Ethnic Studies course:  Should include examples of civic engagement (e.g., voting and other peaceful social justice activities) and the impact they have had on United States history. Students who are considering volunteering, social justice activities, community engagement, etc., should consult with their school



teacher/advisor and parents/guardians to evaluate that the activities are lawful, peaceful, and nonviolent.

 ""Whenever possible, should [create] opportunities for participation and for reflection on the responsibilities of citizens in a free society"" (History Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016, p. 19).""

Chapter 3, Page 20, Lines 527-528: ""the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners"" should be edited to specifically name other Middle Eastern immigrant populations that have explicitly asked for inclusion in the ESMC. This could be done as follows:

ï¿½ ""the unique experiences of Middle Eastern populations such as Arabs, Mizrahi Jews, Iranians, Kurds, Coptic-Christians, Yezidis, and others""

The Middle Eastern immigrant communities that have asked to be represented in the curriculum include:

 Mizrahi Jews  Iranians  Kurds  Assyrian-Christians  Coptic-Christians  Yezidis  Baha'is  Zoroastrians

These diverse communities represent ""an estimated combined total population of over 500,000, or at least 60%, of the Middle Eastern diasporic population in California"". They should not be simply lumped together using the term ""other Middle Easterners"".

Overall, it is essential that these groups be represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans in the ESMC. Otherwise, the ESMC will unwittingly reproduce a long history and ongoing reality of imperialist oppression and erasure of non-Arab and nonMuslim ethnic and religious groups in the Middle East.

While it is good that ""Assyrians and Jews"" are mentioned in line 607 of this chapter, this is not sufficient because they are not identified as Middle Eastern immigrant communities or represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans.

Chapter 3, Page 26, Line 699: The Introduction to Ethnic Studies Course Outline should be revised to include a section on different forms of hatred, including antisemitism in all its forms across the political spectrum. Content about antisemitism should draw from the following resources:

 Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews, 9ï¿½12



ï¿½ Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era ï¿½ Working Definition of Antisemitism

Appendix A, Page 6, Line 8166-67: While it is important to acknowledge the times when Jewish and Irish immigrants and their descendants faced significant discrimination, the following assignment is problematic for reasons given below:

""Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege.""

1) The assumption in this sentence flattens out the Jewish experience in the U.S. by casting all Jews as white. This disregards the diversity within the American Jewish community, which includes Mizrahi Jewish immigrants from Arab countries, Iran and other Muslim majority states where Jews fled persecution. It also ignores Sephardic Jews, Black Jews, Latino Jews and the emerging Jewishidentified descendants of Spanish Jews whose ancestors were forced to convert to Christianity and flee the Inquisition.

2) It ignores the experience of ""white"" Jews who are specifically targeted today by ""white nationalists"" for violence, such as the synagogue attacks in Pittsburgh, PA and Poway, California. The victims were murdered because of the perpetrators' perceptions that they are non-white and are enemies of the ""white race.""

3) This is significant given that the Holocaust is still in living memory of many Ashkenazi Jews, and its traumas passed on to 2nd and 3rd generation descendants. To be experiencing neo-Nazi violence of this type in 21st century America is particularly traumatizing, and Irish Americans do not face this kind of violence by white supremacists.

Appendix A, Page 6, Line 8159-69: Given the problems listed in the previous comment, this should not be the only example of a unit covering the experiences of Jewish Americans that teachers have access to in the ESMC. At minimum, the following educational materials should be included or referenced in the curriculum:

 Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews, 9ï¿½12 ï¿½ Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era ï¿½ Working Definition of Antisemitism

Appendix B, Page 6, Lines 113 A sample lesson should be added to reflect Sample Theme #1: Identity from the Introduction to Ethnic Studies Course Outline from Chapter 3. This would better equip teachers to empower students whose communities are not substantially represented in the ESMC.

Appendix B, Pages 10-16, Lines 216-346



The Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) rightly fought for the just cause of including communities of color in higher education, and at the same time espoused deeply harmful ideas and ideologies in other areas. For example, one of the most prominent leaders of TWLF gave a speech in 1968 in which he, ""attacked Jewish people as exploiters of the Negroes in America and South Africa and called for `victory to the Arab people' over Israel,"" according to a news report from that period. TWLF also drew significant inspiration from Mao Zedong, the communist dictator who was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people. Sample Lesson 2 should be revised to educate about the TWLF accurately and comprehensively, so students come away with an understanding that TWLF and other movements can promote good ideas about some issues and bad ideas about others.

Appendix B, Page 13, Lines 287-302: This section should include references to Chapter 3, Page 5 where it says students should be exposed to ""multiple and often competing sources of information"". It should also reference Chapter 3, Page 11 regarding respect for diverse viewpoints and guidelines to ""effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues"".

These guidelines should be referenced specifically to address the possibility that a movement chosen by a teacher or student has faced criticism that students should consider, including from individuals, organizations, intellectuals, and leaders who are part of various ethnic minority groups.

Appendix B, Page 20, Lines 439-440: The following question should be added, to fulfill the desired outcome of ""making connections to the varying experiences of all students"":

ï¿½ Which groups have been harmed by housing discrimination and redlining in California?

Appendix B, Page 28, Lines 632-633: Numerous policy recommendations have been released by various groups within the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement, which students could study to better understand BLM. Referencing the 2016 Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) policy platform alone would exclude other ideas and solutions that have been proposed. One example of the differences is that the M4BL platform was used by some activists to inject a one-sided anti-Israel agenda into BLM, while other BLM policy recommendations have not included this harmful bias. Including a wider variety of policy platforms and recommendations would help ensure that students are exposed to ""multiple and often competing sources of information,"" as stated in Chapter 3.

Appendix B, Page 41 Defining ""interpersonal racism"" as something only white people do would prevent a full understanding of interpersonal oppression and potentially decrease accountability for individuals from other communities who engage in various forms of interpersonal hate.



For example, individuals from many different backgrounds engage in antisemitism targeting Jews from many different backgrounds. Language about racism by white people against people of color should certainly remain in this section, with edits to ensure that other forms of interpersonal hate are acknowledged as well.

Attachment 11: Additional CDE Recommendations Adding a sample lesson solely focused on Arab American Studies would exclude diverse communities which represent at least 60% of Middle Eastern Americans in California. CDE should change its recommendation to add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern Americans, including Arabs, Iranians, Jews, Kurds, Assyrian Christians, and others. This unit should include the course outline ""Antisemitism and Middle EasternAmerican Jews, 9ï¿½12."" There is no educational or moral justification for favoring one Middle Eastern community over all others.

From: Rama Bharadwaj Sent: Tuesday, September 1, 2020 1:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Americans cannot be excluded from Ethnic Studies.

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,

It's never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.

The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as ""vectors"" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.

The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies.

Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.

Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students.

In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.

TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to AYO's findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school.

Sincerely, Rama Bharadwaj

Dear CDE, I would like to thank you for listening to my community's concerns voiced last August and for considering the concerns we still have after the revisions. While a lot of progress has been made, I am genuinely worried about the lack of transparency that has surrounded the addition of an Arab-American sample lesson, as this chapter was heavily flawed in the first draft. The BDS movement harms minority groups in American and advocates for a foreign conflict that falls outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses in the U.S. If any reference at all, whether within the curriculum or citations, were to be made, the ESMC would ultimately be promoting hate and discrimination through the mention of this hateful movement. Further, I ask that you please reconsider the chapter on Jewish Americans as it is erases the discrimination experienced by Jews and replaces it with this notion of racial privilege, further fueling antisemitism. With the power vested in the CDE I ask that you act on your responsibility to give an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps.

Dear Tony Thurmond,

It has come to my attention that the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, in regards to the Asian American section, has failed to include a detailed history of the Japanese American community. The current draft of the curriculum outline has reduced the Japanese American experience down to one bullet point on page 91. This is unacceptable. The Japanese American community has been an integral part of California history; from the farmers who made the ""unfarmable"" land flourish with producer, to the activists who challenged the supreme court against the incarceration of 120,000 people based on their race.

It has also come to my attention that this current outline also leaves out the Vietnamese American, Korean American, and South Asian American groups as well as many others. We are also aware that the first draft of the curriculum had a Pan-Asian studies which covered issues such as the Model Minority Myth. This is critical to our Asian American history, and to leave this section out would be a disservice to the children who don't understand what it means to be Asian American, despite being bullied and attacked by others for being Asian American.

Please reconsider the Asian American curriculum in your Ethnic Studies proposal to be more inclusive of many other groups.

From: Rajanpreet Pannu Sent: Tuesday, September 8, 2020 7:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Stop Ignoring Sikhs in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum

Dear California Department of Education,

On March 31, 2020, the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement submitted a series of specific recommendations for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to ensure accurate and meaningful representation of the Sikh community in the curriculum. This was accompanied by a letter from 52 California gurdwaras (Sikh houses of worship) supporting these requested changes. None of these changes were taken on board or effected in the second draft of the Model Curriculum. In fact, none of the recommendations ever received a formal response or any indication that they were even seriously considered as part of the 2020 review process.

The latest draft strips away multiple mentions of the Sikh community and its rich, century-old contributions to California to a single story in the context of discrimination in the aftermath of 9/11. Sikhs should be mentioned here because it is absolutely true that there has been a rising number of bias, bullying, and hate crimes against Sikhs in California (according to the Sikh Coalition, since 2015 no other state has had more anti-Sikh hate crimes in the nation). However, Sikhs must also be equally recognized for the work that has been done to counter the rise of xenophobia in California. Singly encountering the Sikh community only through the lens of victimization results in the continued flattening and dehumanization of our communities.

Sikhs have a large population in the state, numbering approximately 250,000 and a significantly high density in the K-12 student population in more than 20 of California's public school districts (Yuba City Unified and Central Unified have more than 12 percent, and Punjabi is the third most commonly spoken language in the Central Valley). Given this magnitude and concentration of the Sikh population in California, our powerful immigration stories, our immensely positive contributions to the state for more 125 years, and our involvement in antiracist and anti-colonialist movements, it is imperative that we are also included in a positive way which highlights our unique stories and contributions in a distinct context--not in comparison to other communities. Such minimal representation would result in further marginalization and misunderstanding of the Sikh community.

Our recommendations:

1. Insert a lesson plan about the Sikh community (which falls under the discipline of Asian



American studies), in order to ensure that meaningful teaching about Sikhism will actually reach classrooms. The lesson plan can be found in the original letter of recommendations and edits.

2. Reconvene the original committee of writers and experts of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and include the Sikh community as a stakeholder in this process.

3. Maintain the integrity of the Ethnic Studies framework with disciplinary knowledge, language, and pedagogy.

The decision to ask individual schools and school districts to choose which communities to include--as opposed to laying out a strong, detailed curriculum with many specific examples-will mean that teaching about Sikhism will continue to be ignored in most classrooms across the state. This will have devastating long-term repercussions for the California Sikh community in our shared efforts to educate all Californians about the history and contributions of communities that make our state great.

The CDE and IQC must stop ignoring the requests of the Sikh community and address our concerns. We are committed to working with the CDE and IQC as a stakeholder in the process for more meaningful and accurate representation of the Sikh community in the curriculum.

Esteemed Board Member:

I am writing to demand the implementation of Black experiences, voices, and history in K-12 curriculum.

Subjecting students to a Eurocentric curriculum throughout their most formative years contributes significantly to the perpetuation of systemic racism within schools. This then contributes significantly to the degradation of Black people beyond the classroom.

Please read the full letter of demands here: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__racialequityed.org_demands&d=DwIFAg&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=3n2Ph0yfjfhTxLmSW7q-OHSNB0Po7tG6km81y9KCAcY&m=8FNBI3MNXIB_ZB9wL6uvpitjGVc-33p18FjPVA1fdg&s=sv6b2q3UibiErMZ1K9lHb0lwGbdkyhOUGYTY0b6p-zQ&e=

These demands are not new. They are an amplification of the calls to action of activists, students, and educators who have asked your school district to immediately implement racially inclusive, anti-racist Ethnic Studies.

The time is long overdue to make change. White supremacy in public education must end now. There is no room for negotiation and placation. The time is now to tear down racism and demonstrate your commitment to ending systemic racism perpetuated by the use of Eurocentric curriculum.

My name is eunju and I am a teacher at thanksgiving korean School I oppose the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in its current form, unless the CDE

California recognizes Korean Americans through two resolutions. Hangul Day was passed on October 19, 2019 and recognizes the Korean American community as ""an integral part of mainstream American society"" that has ""made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas."" California also recognized Korean American Day on January 13, 2020 by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 142, which declares that ""with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans.""

I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. Thank you for your consideration

Sincerely yours, Eunju park.

Dear California Department of Education,

While I was happy to hear about the many revisions made to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum that removed antisemitism and BDS, I'm concerned to hear about the lack of transparency about an additional chapter added to the lesson plan. The protocol of allowing the public to review the curriculum and comment on it allows constituents to hold the CDE to its commitment against discrimination, as promised when revising the first draft. I ask that the CDE stand by its previous pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum, and to open the additional sample chapter up to fair and transparent review prior to the closing of the comment period on September 30th. I'm also concerned about some of the materials of the curriculum, such as the use of the book, Education at War, as well as the misleading and harmful discussion of Jewish Americans attaining racial privilege. Please make these changes and make it a curriculum that everyone can learn from without fear of discrimination.

From: Gershon Bialer Sent: Wednesday, September 2, 2020 12:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum: Jewish Americans must not be excluded!

Dear Instructional Quality Commission,

I am joining the call for meaningful inclusion of Jewish Americans in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.

The removal of denigrating content from the initial draft and the addition of an acknowledgement that antisemitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians it must be truly inclusive, and that includes representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community. Limited references to the Holocaust in history classes simply do not suffice.

Jews are an ethnic group that has historically faced intense discrimination and genocide, and Jews remain targets of hatred from the far left and right today. There are groups in the United States and California that seek to erase the Jewish experience from the history books, deny Jewish ethnic identity, and eliminate Jews. Antisemitic incidents and violent attacks have only increased in recent years. To exclude these facts from consideration in a curriculum for all Californians is unacceptable.

Additionally, Jewish Americans are diverse. Approximately 15 percent of Jews are people of color and people from the Middle East and North Africa. If the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is to be expansive in its inclusion of ethnic groups, then the Jewish American experience must be included.

That is why we are calling for:

1) The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism.

2) No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future.

3) The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans.

From: Noah Bareket Sent: Sunday, September 13, 2020 9:45 AM To: [emails redacted]; Tony Thurmond; Ethnic Studies Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove One-Sided Political Agenda from ESMC

Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and Governor Gavin Newsom,

I write to you with deep concern about the current draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and to express my support for the detailed revision requests recently sent to you by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.

I join in urging you to remove the political agenda from the ""Guiding Values and Principles"" and resulting lessons by:

1. Removing the inflammatory ""Guiding Values,"" which promote radical ideological aims such as ""transformative post-imperial resistance,"" and can be used to justify bringing hate and political dogma into the classroom.

2. Aligning all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes, and identify those Outcomes as ""Guiding Principles and Outcomes.""

3. Adding the Los Angeles Unified School District's Elements of a Balanced Curriculum as guidelines against politicizing Ethnic Studies classes.

4. Excluding the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement and other one-sided political conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts, which do not belong in California Ethnic Studies and create unsafe classrooms for students.

5. Incorporating approaches to social change from a wide range of political orientations, including methods that work within the US system to improve it.

Thank you for your attention to these crucial problems in the ESMC.

Sincerely,

Noah Bareket Saratoga resident

Dear IQC Representatives, I am joining the numerous calls for continued improvement of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Your removal of negative content from the initial draft and the acknowledgement that anti-Semitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians there must be a renewed commitment to transparency in every step of this curriculum's creation, added safeguards to what can be taught in this curriculum, and have more inclusive representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community. That is why I am requesting for the following FOUR requests of the ESMC: 1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel, including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Re-commit to transparency and the pre-determined process of writing the ESMC Thank you for the consideration. Sincerely California Residents,

Heidi and Jon Monkarsh

From: Soo Yoo Sent: Sunday, September 27, 2020 8:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] [APISBMA] Inclusive AAPI Unit

Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,

I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:

1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: - Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community - Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart

2. At minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.

The ""Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies"" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.

Sincerely, Soo Yoo School Board Clerk ABC Unified School District

From: Yisrael Gelb Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:03 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment On Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum

To the Honorable Tony Thurmond,

I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed CDE ethnic studies model curriculum. The State Board of Education guidelines state that the curriculum shall "" be inclusive"" and ""encourage cultural understanding.""

Many of the model curriculums published in Appendix A are deeply offensive to me, as well as the Jewish community at large. Any insinuation (e.g. see page 8) that Jews have gained racial privilege and have ""joined the club"" of those enjoying white privilege and superiority, is nothing less than hate speech.

Furthermore, over the protest of many, the decision was made to focus the curriculum on only four groups, including Asian-Americans. Yet, somehow included in this group are the Arab/Muslim Americans (e.g. see pages 15 and 20). As reported in the Jewish Journal (https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/opinion/320528/its-time-we-talk-about-iranian-jews-andcalifornias-ethnic-studies-curriculum/), the proposed curriculum ignores Iranian religious communities -- Jews, Christians, Zoroastrians and Bahais -- integral to the Los Angeles population.

For the state to consider Arab-Muslims as Asian Americans (see Chapter 3, page 20) is a distortion of an Arab history full of hatred and persecution of the Jewish nation. It also blatantly ignores the fact that Israel is a state in the Asian continent. Many of the proposed model curriculum are deeply flawed as it relates to issues of anti-Semitism and the persecution of Jews throughout history. It cannot be said that they are inclusive and encourage cultural understanding.

Finally, California is the most diverse state in this great nation. The curriculum should be reflective of that and include cultural sensitivity to all ethnicities and races. Many nationalities have been and continue to be subject to stereotypes and hatred in this country. We have strength in our diversity, regardless of the color of our skin. The curriculum needs to do a better job reflecting that.

The SBE guidelines require the inclusive input from local nonprofits and advocacy groups, and recommends creating a steering committee of invested parties. I highly encourage you to include local organizations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Agudath Israel of California in further drafts of the proposed curriculum.

Sincerely,



Rabbi Yisrael Gelb Chief Executive Officer Agudath Israel of California
