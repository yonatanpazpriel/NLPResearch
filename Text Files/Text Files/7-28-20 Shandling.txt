Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 
 
Please give due weight to the opinions of ethnic studies scholars re revision of California ethnic 
studies curriculum. Since our students can expect to encounter people of many diverse ethnic 
and religious communities living in our state they need acquire sympathetic information about 
all groups living together here. 
 
Sincerely, 
M Shandling
