TO: Board of Directors, Oakland United School District 
 
SUBJECT: Vote YES on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 
 
 
Block by Block Organizing Network (BBBON) is a city-wide, district-based group of volunteers 
working together for “One Oakland.”  Many of our members and supporters have children who 
attend schools throughout the City, and all of us are passionate in our concern that Oakland’s 
schools serve all our children well.  
 
We urge you to lift up one of OUSD’s core values – Students First – by supporting the Ethnic 
Studies Model Curriculum led by scholars of color from across California.  Oakland is exactly 
the kind of city that should stand up for our underrepresented communities and assure that all our 
students see themselves reflected in their studies. 
 
Ethnic Studies is about empowering students of color who are marginalized and minimized by 
old curricula.  All students -- including white students -- greatly benefit from having critical 
conversations about race and ethnicity, so that all Oaklanders can build skills to participate in our 
society and build stronger communities and neighborhoods. 
 
Now, more than ever, Pacific Islander, Arab American, and Central American Studies must be 
included.  That should be self-evident and non-controversial.  But unfortunately, some see fit to 
disparage the need for this curriculum.  This controversy is a perfect example of exactly why all 
students should be exposed to conversations addressing racial and ethnic tensions in our 
community, so that they – and all of us -- can move toward healing, understanding, and solidarity 
across all of our cultures. 
 
The current attacks on Ethnic Studies, and Arab American Studies in particular, are unjust and 
racist.  The Oakland School Board must reject them.  We urge you to vote YES to adopt the 
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
