Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti Jewish curriculum 
  
Good morning, I was wondering why a school curriculum would discriminate against a whole 
group of people because of their religion? Why would you target just one country for 
annihilation - this is in BDS’s charter as well as Hamas’s.  I never thought I would have to plead 
for fair and equal treatment for Jews, considering almost my entire family was murdered by 
Nazis. This feels very much like Germany of the 1930s when schools used incitement to 
brainwash children. Please don’t isolate and discriminate against Jews. Don’t use propaganda to 
isolate and discriminate against one country.  
 
If this falls under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act., you’re providing cause for a massive lawsuit. 
I’m a Californian and my tax dollars help fund schools. I can’t allow this to go forward. 
 
 
Please do the right thing and erase bigotry and hate from our children’s curriculum.
