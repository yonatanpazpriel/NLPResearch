I am deeply troubled to learn that a radical anti-Israel curriculum is being introduced into the California school 
curriculum. Is a radical critique being introduced into the curriculum against China for rounding up Muslims for 
forced conversions or for violently subduing Hong Kong? And what of Russia and Iran are they being attacked for 
tearing apart Syria? Singling out Israel as the source of world evil is a Medieval Jew- hating practice. 
 
What is the difference between Jews escaping persecution by the Europeans to Israel and the recent migration of 
millions of Muslims to Europe. Most experts agree by the end of this century Europe will be a Muslim world. The 
only differences between the migrations are that Jews escaped to a land where there has been a continuous 
Jewish community since ancient times only to be faced with a people that sided with the Nazis during World War II 
and like the Nazis are intent upon eliminating them. 
 
Population transfers are a reality of this world. Are white Americans going to return to Europe? Palestinians were 
offered 95% of their demands several times in the past and refused to make peace. Are they going to be criticized 
for warmongering? 
 
I think not. I do not believe the Israel side will be presented at all in the curriculum. This is indoctrination not 
education. If you insist on indoctrinating students to be advocates of a Palestinian war against the Jews, I will be 
forced to join with other concerned individuals and organizations and take legal action against the California school 
system.
