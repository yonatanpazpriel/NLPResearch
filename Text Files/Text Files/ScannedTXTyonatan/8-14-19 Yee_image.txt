Instructional Quality Commission
California Department of Education

Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
Dear Chairwoman Chao:
I appreciate the time and effort the Instructional Quality Commission has put into developing the recently released draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
As a daughter of immigrants who has been personally and professionally dedicated to promoting diversity and inclusion for all Californians, I must express my grave concerns that the current draft of the ESMC is unacceptable. I know you have received many comments on this topic, including a detailed letter from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus. I would like to associate my concerns with those articulated in their letter.
I am certain you and the Commission would agree that anti-Semitism and discrimination have no place in our schools or society. I believe the ESMC can and should make every effort to ensure curriculum in our schools promotes policies of inclusion and more accurately discusses Jewish and Israeli-American communities.
Thank you for taking the time to consider my concerns. If you have any questions about my opposition to this measure, please feel free to call me at (916) 445-2636, or your staff can reach my Chief of Staff, Karen Greene Ross, at kgreeneross@sco.ca.gov or (916) 327-1361.
Sincerely,
BETTY T. YEE
