General Comments
Always thought education was to teach people how to think.
This proposed curriculum presents one side only of the content.
Chapter 1
Personally empower people - is this the purpose of the school or something people develop as they mature and experience life?
Many of the words used are not “common” language and how many people understand what they mean? Examples are “hegemony, nepantlas” to name a few.
On what basis is Capitalism described as “a form of power and oppression?” What data supports this? Where, in the history of the world, has another economic structure produced greater opportunity for people? What data supports this assumption?
Benefits cited as a result of this type of curriculum? What data supports this? Where has this curriculum be tried and the outcomes documented in studies?
Is it really the job of schools to produce students who are “agents of change?”
In conclusion, this curriculum appears to me to be divisive and bashing of white cultures.
Why aren’t both sides of these issues presented and students allowed to make their own conclusions? It is a prime example of brain washing.
One can only hope, that some group of people who can think clearly, will stop the implementation of this curriculum and replace it with a more balanced, historically accurate curriculum.
