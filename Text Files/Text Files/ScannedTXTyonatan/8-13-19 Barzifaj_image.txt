Re: Proposed Anti-Israel, Anti-Jewish Ethnic Studies
Dear Sir,
My Name is Maya Barzilai and I am a concerned parent of children in schools in the state of California.
I was really upset to see the proposed curriculum that does not include Jews as an ethnic group, calls to boycott divest and sanction Israel and more anti-Israel, Anti-Jew propaganda.
As a mother, I teach my children to respect and love others no matter of their, beliefs, ethnicity or background. I refuse to believe that the state of California approves such curriculum full of hate and misleading information.
I am asking you to please take action and remove these proposed Studies from the curriculum. I would love to see more focus on teaching kids about accepting and respecting all people no matter of their backgrounds.
Looking forward hearing back from you.
Kind Regards,
Maya Barzilai
