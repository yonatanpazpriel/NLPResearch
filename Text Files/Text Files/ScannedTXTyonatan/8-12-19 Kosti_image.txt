Dear members of the committee,
I’m writing to you as a CA resident and a worried mother of two wonderful young kids.
The Department of Education California is creating a new ethnic studies curriculum. This program to my understanding calls to boycott Israel in three different classes, attempts to explain the conflict in the middle east using a single-sided story, encourage discrimination and aggression and spread hate against Israelis and Jews. A new objective curriculum is the right choice for California, based on the values of tolerance and acceptance towards minorities.
We had over 224 mass shootings this year, one of them was very close to where we live, in Gilroy, CA, and took the lives of three innocent people, including two kids. Almost all the mass shootings were directed towards minorities, including Israelis and Jews.
I'm worried that the suggested change might cause to even more hate that will result in more violence towards minorities, I will be worried for my children's safety once this program will pass. Will my children become a target because their parents were born in Israel or because we are Jews? I'm asking you to act now, so it will never happen.
Thank you for your consideration,
