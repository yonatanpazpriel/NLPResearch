To Whom It May Concern,  
 
I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote 
the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the 
teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public school”. 
 
I don’t understood how the currently proposed curriculum could have gotten this far in the approval process given its appallingly 
biased and anti-Semitic content. 
 
I hope that with an honest assessment of the contents, you will recognize the reasons for the concerns of many in the Jewish 
community and revise the curriculum accordingly, so as not to propagate anti-Jewish and anti-Israel sentiments that are already 
creating situations on US college campuses wherein Jewish students are made to feel unsafe and unwanted due to virulent anti-
Israel bias.  
 
Thank you for your consideration,
