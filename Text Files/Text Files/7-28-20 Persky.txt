Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Ethnic Studies! Tell Arab American Stories. 
  
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 
 
I agree that itâ€™s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support 
the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.  
 
If we are to be a "United" States, we must feel united, and we do that by knowing more about 
our neighbors 
 
Sincerely, 
Ruth Persky
