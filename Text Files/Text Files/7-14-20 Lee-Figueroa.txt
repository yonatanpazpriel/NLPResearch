Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM 
  
I understand that a well-funded right-wing campaign is aiming at eliminating the Arab American 
content and branding any mention of Palestine as anti-semitic.  Supporting the rights of 
Palestinians is not anti-semitic; it is supporting the rights of people whose land was stolen out 
from under them in 1947, when the US and Germany agreed to "grant" a "homeland" to Jewish 
people who had been persecuted.  So, in true American fashion, just steal land from indigenous 
people and put them on reservations, right? 
I further understand that on August 13, 2020, the IQC is meeting to consider a revised 
curriculum, all while leaving Arab American scholars shut out of the revision process.  Many 
organizations and individuals have stepped forward to support the ESMC and the inclusion of 
Arab American studies, including the National Association of Asian American Studies; Arab 
American Studies Association; Oakland, Albany, San Francisco, Hayward, Castro Valley and West 
Contra Costa School Boards; California Chapters of Black Lives Matter; Bay Area Jewish Voice 
for Peace; and the Third World Liberation Front Veterans. 
A person should be able to support a just, fair and equitable peace movement in the Middle 
East without being harassed a being anti-semitic.  And Palestinians have a right to have their 
voices heard and their story told in a curriculum like this, without being harassed as terrorists, 
and to be free from anti-Muslim slurs.
