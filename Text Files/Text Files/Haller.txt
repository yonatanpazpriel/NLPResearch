I am a retired teacher and I just read about the proposed ethnic studies 
curriculum for California elementary schools. I felt like I was in Germany 
in the 1930s when Hitler was indoctrinating the youth. I feel sick at 
what is being proposed. Anti-Semitic? Anti-capitalism? Pro-Iran? Anti-
Israel?  Capitalism is racist and is compared to white supremacy?  Will 
we once again have concentration camps? Gas chambers to kill the 
undesirables? What I read was frightening. I hope the Department of 
Education will drop this plan or if it is adopted, I hope that courageous 
teachers will refuse to teach it. I know I would not teach it.
