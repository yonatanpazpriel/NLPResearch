Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
  
Good Day Chairperson Soon Chao, 
 
I plead with you to please make sure that the good idea of ethnic studies is apolitical and fair to all 
minorities.  Please do not allow the current draft, with its overt biases (and international political agenda), be ever 
approved as is.  Making a better society out of our future citizens must not instill in them hate for the other.  What 
makes the US unique is the rich tapestry of ethnic minorities that enrich the main culture, however the old 
baggage of hate that some group carry with them does not fit our society.  Blood feuds need to be left behind in 
the country of origin and a new slate started once they join (not coerced to join) our society.  We are one culture 
that is rich in multi-ethnic cultures, if we fracture that cohesiveness we are guaranteed to split into clans with 
never ending conflicts as one can see in the Middle East. 
 
Please do your best to serve our society and avoid the negative brainwashing that hate filled stereotyping 
curriculum may cause to our next generation. 
 
Respectfully yours, 
 
George Bendor 
Columbia, MD
