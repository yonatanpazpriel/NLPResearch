I am very upset to hear about the new curriculum being proposed by the State's Board of Education. The draft 
completely excludes Jewish people as an ethnicity, does not mention anti-Semitism as a form of hate or bigotry, and 
describes BDS as a peaceful social movement that only seeks liberation of “Palestine” while ignoring the movements 
anti-Semetic and racist roots. This model curriculum marginalizes all Jewish people in California and is particularly 
damaging to Israeli-Americans, and will result in greater anti-Semitism statewide. 
 
I demand that the California Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission modify the current 
model curriculum to be inclusive of Jewish Californians and Californians of Israeli descent. 
 
Sincerely, 
Seth
