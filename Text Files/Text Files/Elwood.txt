I am a retired 4th grade teacher, and American History Major. I was very disappointed to miss 
the opportunity to comment on the ethnic studies curriculum, and I strongly urge that you allow 
additional comments in September after the IQC meeting. This is an enormously important issue. 
 
Thank you for your work on behalf f California students. 
 
Sincerely, 
Sara Elwood
