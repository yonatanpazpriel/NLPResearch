Subject: Sikh inclusion in CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 
  
Dear Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee, I am writing today to request the 
meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for entry into 
the public record. 
 
My name is Jasnoor Sandhu and I live in Sacramento California. I attend NP3 High School in 
Natomas school district in grade 12.  I want this inclusion to take place as my entire life I 
have had to constantly explain who I am why I can't do certain things and have had to deal with 
racism due to the lack of education on my religion. This inclusion will give people who are not 
aware of Sikhism to finally understand who we are and where we come from. 
Thank you.
