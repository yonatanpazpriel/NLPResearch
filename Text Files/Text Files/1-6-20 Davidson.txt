Subject: [EXTERNAL] The Jewish question  
  
Hello,  
 
The woeful handling of Jewish issues in the recent bill - while yes, being revised, but only after a 
last minute controversy- is tied in to the recent outbreak of anti semitism, in this city, NYC, and 
world wide - which comes not just from the right, but very sadly from the left and from your 
committe. 
 
How can kids be educated away from anti semitism when the alleged adults are either so 
ignorant or themselves anti semitic - and your committe is clearly one or the other, and just 
trying to backpedal having been caught, last minute.
