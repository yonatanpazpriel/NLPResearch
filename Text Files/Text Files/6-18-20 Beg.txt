Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 
  
Hello School Board Members, 
  
I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft. Your support would 
mean the world to me. My family and I have lived in Foster City for 20years. We have never 
seen adequate representation of the narratives of people of color in our textbooks, despite the 
enormous diversity of the community we live in.  
  
Your resolution is a moving step for social justice. From the bottom of my heart: Please vote to 
support this!
