Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-Semitic School Curriculum 
  
Dear Commissioner Chao, 
 
I strongly urge you to immediately STOP the spread of the poisonous 
anti-Semitic ESMCD curriculum in California schools. 
 
Many school districts have mistakenly adopted this subversive and 
racist curriculum, not fully aware that it vilifies the Jewish State and 
praises terrorism and terrorists. 
 
This must end right now!  Children must not be taught to hate and 
become racist and anti-Semitic bigots! 
 
Thank you. 
Rabbi Larry Gevirtz
