Hello, my name is Alexander and I will be starting my master's degree in Teaching Foreign 
Language (MA TFL Arabic) at the Middlebury Institute in Monterey starting this fall. 
 
I'm writing to advocate for an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) that includes Arab 
Americans, women and men like Rashida Tlaib, Linda Sarsour, Ralph Nader, and Steve Jobs. As 
an Asian American, I know personally how displacing it is to not have one's history officially 
sanctioned by public education systems. To take on the challenges facing the United States, we 
need to teach students how diverse our country is and how interwoven our history is. 
 
Additionally, I would like to add how including Palestinian history and defending human rights is 
not at all anti-Semitic. In fact, ignorance of the situation in the Middle East provides fuel for 
racist anti-Semites acting in bad faith and spreading fake news. An assessment of what is 
happening there in the context of an ESMC would be an important step in countering this and 
would help to build peacebuilding movements. 
 
Thank you for your consideration. I hope you and everyone you know are doing well during 
these times.  
 
Sincerely, 
Alexander
