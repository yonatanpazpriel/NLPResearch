Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 
 
I am writing to urge you to keep both Ethnic Studies, and Arab American studies as part of the 
Asian American component. In a country where anti-Arab sentiment is widespread and 
stereotypes outpace information, it is vital that we include representation of our most 
vulnerable community members in the curriculum that is presented to California students. 
 
Sincerely, 
Margaret Stafford
