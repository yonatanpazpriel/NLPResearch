Dear Ethnic Studies Committee, 
 
     It has come to my attention that in the process of trying to teach about Ethnic groups, one group has been 
misrepresented in a negative light.  This includes condemning the only democracy that includes people from 
different religions and backgrounds in daily life, and government.  Israel and the Jewish People need to be judged 
by the same rules as other countries and people.  The BDS movement is similar to the Nazis in the 1930s telling 
people to refuse to buy from Jewish shops.  Please invite or allow respected people from the Jewish community to 
have input in the details of Ethnic Studies that will shape the minds of children and country. 
 
 
Thank you, 
 
Sharon Kuritzky
