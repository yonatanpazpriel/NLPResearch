Hi there, 
 
I'm writing to you today urging you to include an Arab American curriculum in our state's 
schools. I am proud to be half Syrian; my father emigrated to the United States and has built an 
amazing life and family here, and it would have been amazing to learn about my ethnicity in the 
classroom. I think it will help so many students feel seen, feel a connection to the material, and 
connect with the people in those lessons that look like them and their own families. 
 
I fully support the ESMC, including Arab American studies. The ESMC is structured around the 
core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, 
Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. Following a 
decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies within 
Asian American studies. Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of 
Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American 
studies in the CA ESMC. 
 
I was not surprised to learn that Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, 
academic, and social outcomes for students. Why wouldn't you want all of that for the millions 
of students in our state? 
 
Thank you for your time and I urge you to support ESMC, including Arab American studies. 
 
Jana
