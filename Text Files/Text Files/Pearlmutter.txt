Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,  
 
I am extremely upset by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in its current 
form. I support the idea of providing an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make a 
significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the 
recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, 
Jimena, Amcha and others. 
 
When in college I experienced an inordinate amount of antisemitism and donâ€™t want my 
children to have a similar experience during their formative years in middle and high 
school.  
 
We live in San Francisco, go to the public schools and relish the ethnic diversity, 
however the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum misses the mark in terms of inclusivity.  
 
The Ethnic Studies Model Cirriculum fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative 
stereotypes and institutionalized the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public 
schools. 
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewriteof the Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum to address these concerns. 
 
Thank you, 
Lisa Douglass Pearlmutter
