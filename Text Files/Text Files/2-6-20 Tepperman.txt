Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save ethnic studies – don’t shut out Arab-American experience 
 
Dear Instructional Quality Commission Shanine Coats, 
 
As a person with a Jewish heritage I am appalled at the latest attempt by Zionists to 
supress legitimate discussion of Middle Eastern history, politics, and culture. Especially 
at this time when Islamophobia is being used to justify reckless militarism and inflated 
war budgets, II am deeply concerned with reports that Arab American Studies may be 
cut from Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), under the false premise of it not 
being within the four racialized groups of Ethnic Studies.  
 
The field’s leaders of color, including the Association of Asian American Studies, Asian 
American Studies Department Chairs, and the Save CA Ethnic Studies Coalition – are 
insisting Arab American Studies belongs in the curriculum, and that it remain.   
  
As is evident in the spirit of AB2016 legislation, the California Department of Education 
must respect communities of color, and have deference to Ethnic Studies professors 
and practitioners of color for this project. 
  
Efforts to undermine or water-down any critical components of the draft, and of Ethnic 
Studies as a field must be rejected.  
 
I know you are well-aware of the targeted attacks on Arabs and Muslims by the Trump 
administration, and the demonization of the struggle of migrants and people of color 
throughout the United States. As a sanctuary state, California should continue to be a 
counterweight against that trend – not serve as a stamp of approval. 
 
Sincerely, 
Jean Tepperman 
Berkeley, CA
