Dear School Board Members, 
 
I am writing to you with hope that you will pass the resolution to incorporate the Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum into our school district. As a parent of 3 who have gone through the San Mateo Foster 
City School District, I am proud to be a resident of this district since 2002 and moved to Foster City due to 
the ethnic diversity, location, amenities and family friendly lifestyle. However, although my kids got a great 
education, there was part of the curriculum that was missing. To supplement this I would volunteer my 
time to to attend school during Islamic holidays to explain why we celebrate our Holidays. The 
teachers would welcome me as they were aware this module was missing from the curriculum. Its too late 
for my kids, but not too late for the next generation who can go to school and feel part of the fabric of the 
education system where their culture is displayed in school which can resonate with them and make them 
feel proud to be American 
 
As a city, and a state that prides itself with being ethnically diverse, it should live up to those expectations 
by representing the voice of every member of the community in schools. I believe education is the way 
forward to breaking down barriers between races by making each member of the community feel 
inclusive. If we had Ethnic studies in our schools, it will help make other ethnicities look less foreign so a 
child grows up with familiarity and less prejudice towards other races. Acceptance and inclusion 
will eliminate seclusion and ignorance. We have a long way to go, and I am holding you 
accountable to your support of Ethnic Studies. The time is now for racial justice. Don't 
delay and pass the resolution with integrity and courage! 
 
 
Thank you in advance. 
Sincerely, 
Lubna
