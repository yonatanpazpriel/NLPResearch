I am appalled and sickened at the proposition you have just made regarding an Ethnic's Studies curriculum. Barely 
any mention is made, I am given to understand, to the Jewish Community, it's considerale contributions to the State 
and therefore to our country. I have further read that there is a great deal Israeli criticism. This exacerbates the 
current rising climate of anti-Semitism, a dangerous and frightening prospect. Why is Israel being picked for criticism? 
Surely there are many countries, guilty of terrible abuses and certainly there is much to criticize about the Palestinian 
leadership and predominat Terrorist activites against Israel. But what have other countries to do with concentration on 
Ehics and ethical behavior in the United States. Our country is expeiencing unprecedented 'unethical' violent, hate-
filled examples. By targeting Jews and Israael do you really believe that will result in a greater understanding of 
"others" and help to lessen the terrible climate of prejudice we are experiencing at this tine. Shame on you all who 
have put forth this terrible, outrageou, gut -wrenching plan. 
Yours truly,
