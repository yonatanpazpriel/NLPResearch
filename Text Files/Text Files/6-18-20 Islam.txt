Subject: [EXTERNAL] Letter of Support for Ethnic Studies 
  
Hello School Board Members,  
   
I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft.  Your support would 
mean the world to me. We have never seen the adequate representation of the narratives of 
people of color in our textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the community we live 
in. Part of upholding our commitment to diversity is to make sure that our curriculum properly 
appreciates the amount of diversity in our community, which is why I urge against the removal of 
the Arab American Studies from the Model Curriculum. It is important for us to uphold the 
promise of AB 2016, and to take away Arab American Studies would be taking away from our 
mission to uphold that promise. The goal is to have this curriculum uplift equity, inclusiveness, 
and universally high expectations for education to the highest extent possible, and thus it 
is crucial that we include Arab American Studies.   
   
Your resolution is a moving step for social justice.  From the bottom of my heart: Please vote to 
support the draft and Arab American Studies!  
   
Sincerely, 
Tasnim
