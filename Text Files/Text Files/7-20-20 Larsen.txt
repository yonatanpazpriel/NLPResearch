Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies must include infornation on Palestine . This is human rights 
  
Please see that Arab American studies continue to be included in the CA Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum (ESMC). This model curriculum will boost the teaching of ethnic 
studies in high schools throughout California and will include Arab-American studies 
and sample lessons on Palestine. 
For almost a year, teachers, activists, students, and community members have been 
urging the California Department of Education and its Instructional Quality Commission 
(IQC) to keep the model curriculum intact. I am  opposed to the  well-funded right-wing 
campaign aimed specifically at eliminating the Arab American content. They have tried 
to brand any mention of Palestine as anti-Semitic.  It is not antisemtic to defend human 
rights, and to include Palestinian history and current movements in ethnic studies... 
I support Palestinian human rights and freedom. I am opposed to anyone 
including  those in the Jewish community who are using false charges of antisemitism to 
block the inclusion of Arab-American studies and sample lesson plans which mention 
Palestine.   The history and current struggles in Palestine must be included.
