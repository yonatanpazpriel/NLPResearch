Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 
 
Itâ€™s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support the 
inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.  
 
The best hope we have of coming up with rational public policy is to have an informed 
electorate, and that comes from having a robust education system that includes all issues. I 
strongly support informing our children of issues involving all sorts of peoples. 
 
Sincerely, 
Jennie Elliott
