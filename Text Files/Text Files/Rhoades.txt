To whom it may concern: 
 
I am writing to express my strong disapproval of the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. As 
reported by the New York Times and the Washington Post, this curriculum should 
 
"critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, 
cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and 
oppression at the intersections of our society." 
 
Capitalism -- the economic system practiced in most major countries today and a cornerstone 
of the amazing growth in human health, education, and prosperity over the last several 
centuries -- and anthropocentrism -- the idea that human lives, needs, and aspirations should 
play a central role in decision-making and morality -- are not forms of oppression. To 
characterize them as such -- and to insinuate that they share moral valence with racism and 
white supremacy -- is extreme political agitprop. Such indoctrination has no place in California 
high schools. 
 
I urge you to reject this curriculum. 
 
Sincerely,
