To the Instruction Quality Commission (IQC),  
As a student, I was lucky enough to receive a high school education that included Arab 
American experiences. This was central to understanding the inﬂuence of Arab 
Americans in the United States and unpacking the oppression and prejudice faced not 
only by Arab American community but also by countless other marginalized groups. I 
want to call on the IQC to include Arab American Studies in the revised CA Model 
Ethnic Studies Curriculum and demand that revisions that aﬀect Arab American studies 
be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. 
As a Jew, it has been disheartening to see Zionist groups discredit Arab American 
Studies with false claims of anti-semitism. Our historic marginalization makes it even 
more clear to understand the importance of education and visibility. Arab American 
Studies strengthens the Ethnic Studies Curriculum for all students, including Jewish 
students, not only by contextualizing their history in the US but also by exploring 
marginalized experiences and linking anti-colonial struggles. Exclusion does not bring 
us closer to understanding. 
Lastly, it make sense geographically and categorically to include Arab American 
Studies within the pillar of Asian American Studies. It is not enough to say that good 
teachers and educators will allow space for students excluded from the four pillars to 
connect their own experiences to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum content. We have a 
chance to give real representation and space to the Arab American community, to 
allow Arab American students to see themselves reﬂected in their education, and we 
must take advantage of this opportunity.  
Thank you, 
Emma
