Dear Kenneth McDonald and the Curriculum advisory committee ,  
 
I am a community member deeply concerned about the California 
Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. This 
curriculum endorses prejudice against Jewish, Israeli-American, and 
Zionist students, and delegitimizes their heritage and identity. I ask that 
you respectfully consider removing the currently proposed curriculum 
from the California Department of Education website. Every day that 
the file is available, it does damage to the educational environment. As 
it has already been announced that the curriculum will change, the 
unacceptable material should no longer be available to the public. 
 
Thank you 
 
Erline Rabin
