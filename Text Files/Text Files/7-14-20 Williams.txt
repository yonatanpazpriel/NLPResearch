Dear Educators, 
I strongly support including Arab American studies in the ESMC. Palestinian voices in 
particular have been suppressed by Israeli backers.  Remember, there is nothing anti-
Semetic about supporting Palestinian rights either here or in Palestine.  Please stand up 
for what is right and enhances the status of the powerless, in this case, the 
Palestinians.   As a retired teacher, I believe in the rights of all. 
thank you, 
Lew Williams
