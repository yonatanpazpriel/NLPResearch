Dear Soomin Chao,  
 
As a woman who lost many members of her family to the Holocaust, I respectfully implore you to support our 
community in protesting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school 
board. This curriculum contains false and harshly anti-Semitic material and will only prove to reinforce ugly, untrue 
stereotypes about Jews and unfairly single out Israel for criticism.    
The Jewish community asks for your help in keeping the American public school system free of prejudice and 
hate.   Thank you, sincerely.  
Hila Koren
