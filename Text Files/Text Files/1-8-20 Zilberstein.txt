Pushing an Arab agenda into the education curriculum is a dangerous stance to take. 
Maybe the Jews should push for an anti-Arab stance in the curriculum. After all it is 
Israel that is always being bombed from Gaza, and the wall and check points were put 
up only to protect Israel from terror attacks. How can you in good conscience but BDS 
and other anti Israel things into a school curriculum?
