Subject: [EXTERNAL] Why Jews Should Support the State's Ethnic Studies Model - article by Rabbi Deb 
Noily and Hazzan Shulamit Wise Fairman in J Weekly 
  
Dear Board Members, 
 
Tonight’s board meeting has already begun, so I’m not sure when you’ll get a chance to read this. 
 
https://www.jweekly.com/2020/05/27/why-jews-should-support-the-states-ethnic-studies-model/ 
 
But in regard to tonight’s discussion of the endorsement of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), 
please take a look at this outstanding piece by Rabbi Deb Noily and Hazzan Shulamit Wise Fairman, both 
from the Kehilla Community Synagogue in Piedmont. It supports the ESMC in a beautiful and articulate 
fashion. 
 
Please vote to SUPPORT the measure tonight. 
 
Thank you. 
 
Larry Hendel
