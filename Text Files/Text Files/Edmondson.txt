Dear Chairwoman Chao and California Department of Education committee members- 
 
Please accept this form as my attempt to voice my concern over the current proposed 
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). At a time of rising incidences of anti-semitism 
across the country, and around the world, it is more important than ever that young 
adults of all backgrounds understand the Jewish experience. Part of this understanding 
is the appreciation for the Jewish cultural, religious, historical and spiritual connection to 
the land and State of Israel.  
 
Sincerely, 
 
Pamela Edmondson
