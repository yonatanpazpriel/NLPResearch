Subject: Anti-semetic curriculum 
As a Parent, Grandparent and a Teacher, I protest the use of anti-semetic curriculum and the 
support of hate organizations like BDS, in our primary and secondary schools. I am appalled and 
ashamed of our school systems here in California even proposing such a plan! To bring in and 
use a convicted, escaped to Cuba, cop-killer"s anti-semetic messages to brain-wash our children 
is abhorrent! 
What are you people thinking!
