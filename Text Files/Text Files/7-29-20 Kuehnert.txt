Hi CA Office of Equal Opportunity, 
  
I’m the Co-Director of Video Project, a 501(c)(3). 
We are working to make the new documentary film PUSHOUT: THE CRIMINALIZATION OF BLACK GIRLS 
IN SCHOOLS widely available to schools for educational purposes.  
  
This film could be a great fit for your state’s Equity, Diversity and Inclusion training needs.  
Please don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions.  
  
Synopsis: 
PUSHOUT: THE CRIMINALIZATION OF BLACK GIRLS IN SCHOOLS is a feature length documentary 
which takes a close look at the educational, judicial and societal disparities facing Black Girls. 
Inspired by the groundbreaking book of the same name by renowned scholar, Monique W. 
Morris, Ed.D. The documentary confronts the ways in which the misunderstanding of Black 
girlhood has led to excessive punitive discipline which in turn disrupts one of the most important 
factors in their lives, their education.
