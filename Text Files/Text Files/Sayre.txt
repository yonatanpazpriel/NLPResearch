To whom it may concern, 
 
Iâ€™m a parent of two school aged students in the state of California.  I 
saw on the news last night that the state is trying to pass a class called 
Ethnic Studies and will soon be a requirement to graduate.  If this class 
passes I will immediately seek legal action against the state!!  This is so 
outrageous and you have no right to impose this type of learning on my 
children.  I pay several thousands in taxes! 
 
I would like a response back immediately!
