Lam offering my opinion about the purposed ethnic studies curriculum in California. 1
write as someone who pioneered ethnic.arid women’s studies at the community college where I
worked in the 70’s and 80’s. Our committee, a group of women’s studies and éthnic scholars,
’ organized against a recalcitrant administration. Many times we were offered the chance to have
either ethnic:studies or: women’s studies as a requirement, but we refused to pit one.against the
other.

The reason that we wanted women’s studies. was as urgent as it is today. Girls and
women suffer from an epidemic of issues related to low self-esteem. Girls and women are targets
of sexual assault and partner violence. Girls and women lose their confidence in adolescence-and
enter into self-harming. behaviors or relationships. Girls and women have no idea of their own
history as a gender, which they are not.taught-ini elementary or high school.

I received hundreds of essays testifying to. the therapeutic effects of women’s studies on
the lives of girls, women, and'men. | have seen. students. change their lives as a result-of what
they’ve learned in classes, We will never'solve the problem of gender equality until we teach its
history.

Our group was ultimately successful in getting-a requirement that included both ethnicity
and gender. Based on my 35 years of teaching. women’s studies to first generation students, I
implore you to include this.as part of your new requirement.

Sincerely,

Lauren Coodley
