Subject: Solution to Ethnic Studies 
 
Dear California Education Policy-Maker,   
        As I sent a message previously, I’d like to remind the policy-makers at CDE that labeling a course as 
“Ethnic Studies” is to invite divisiveness and in some cases, antagonistic responses, as you are 
experiencing.  Looking at ethnicities, or even the perception that the course will be focused on specific 
ethnic groups, is a narrow-focused and discriminatory approach to understanding the world today.  I had 
earlier suggested that such a course be named with a more global focus such as World Cultures, Global 
Studies, Human Geography, etc.  In such a course, the key themes would be:  
1.  Fundamental Geography (as students do NOT receive in other classes based on our K-12 HSS 
standards) 
2. Migration Patterns – past and present 
3. Human-Environment Interactions and Natural Resources 
4. Cultural Studies including art, music, language, and traditions 
5. The Global Marketplace and Interdependence in Today’s World 
6. Global Issues – Ecosystems, Global Warming, Social Justice, Democracy At-Risk, etc. 
I believe this type of curriculum will alleviate many of the criticisms you are experiencing in your 
attempts to bring this type of instruction to the public.
