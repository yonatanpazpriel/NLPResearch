Hello School Board Members,  
   
I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft. As a Muslim 
American, I feel that many members of my community have not seen adequate representation 
of the narratives of people of color in our textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the 
community we live in. Part of upholding our commitment to diversity is to make sure 
that our curriculum properly appreciates the amount of diversity in our community, which is why 
I urge against the removal of the Arab American Studies from the Model Curriculum. It is 
important for us to uphold the promise of AB 2016, and to take away Arab American Studies 
would be taking away from our mission to uphold that promise. The goal is to have 
this curriculum uplift equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations for education to the 
highest extent possible, and thus it is crucial that we include Arab American Studies.   
   
Your resolution is a moving step for social justice. Only through education are our personal 
outlooks on the world are created, and we need to do our part to make sure that we play an 
active role in ensuring that the outlooks of our students are well-informed and inclusive. I urge 
you to please vote to support draft and Arab American Studies!  
   
Thank you for your time, 
Maahum Shahab
