Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support Arab-American Studies 
  
Hello, 
I’m emailing you in support and the importance of the CA Arab-American Ethnic Studies 
curriculum. 
As a long time student in California I think it’s appalling that anyone would want to take away 
Arab-American studies,  especially as a Palestinian student. It’s not fair for us to be singled out 
especially in very crucial learning settings and curriculum. It’s not anti-Semitic to include 
Palestinian studies because they are a people with history that should be taught. You would be 
silencing my people and their crucial history and singling out the  Palestinian minority students 
like me within the California education system. For reference, the Palestinian struggle is all 
about human rights and Palestinians (like myself) are considered semites as well. So how can 
you parade inclusivity and the importance of ethnic studies when you silence Palestinian people 
like me and their ethnic history? 
Arab-American studies is important in general because in the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by 
Trump’s Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that 
reflects their histories and current realities.  
Don’t silence Arab-American history especially when it’s needed in ethnic studies. 
Sincerely, 
A long time and proud CA student
