Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab-American Studies in the Curriculum! 
  
Hi there, 
I am a former UC student who is concerned about the potential elimination of Arab-American 
studies from the CA Ethnic Studies curriculum. 
 
I wholeheartedly support the ESMC, INCLUDING Arab American studies. In this era of 
Islamophobia and xenophobia, it’s also important to include West Asian American experiences 
in the ESMC. Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and 
social outcomes for students—without an impartial education on the continued humanitarian 
crisis unfolding between Israel and its annexation of Palestine, students won't have a complete 
picture of the current landscape of international politics. 
 
Thanks, 
Win Mixter
