Dear Ethnic Studies/Board of Education, 
 
Removing Arab American Studies from the curriculum would be a disservice to students across the nation. The 
historical events that have taken place in the Middle East, particularly in Palestine, are of great importance, 
including the literature that has came from our plight. The war crimes that Israel have committed, the illegal 
colonization of Palestinian lands, the oppression that the Palestinian people endure under the Israelis is much like 
what the European Jewish people experienced during the Holocaust. If I am 
not mistaken, the Holocaust is heavily covered in our public school curriculum.  
 
To say that Arab American studies is “anti-semitic” is one of the most ridiculous and zionist statements anyone can 
make. Palestinians are a semitic people.  
 
History is told by the “winners” and thus labeled His Story. Removing Arab American studies supports the notion 
that we want to erase a culture, erase a nation, and erase a people. This same racist behavior has been attempted 
a number of times before. Education should not be another platform that supports the erasure of the Palestinian 
people.  
 
I am Palestinian. Zionism must not dictate how our education system is setup and what is being taught. I implore 
you to re-evaluate this decision.
