26	Assimilation- the process whereby a historically marginalized person or group
27	voluntarily or involuntarily adopts the social, psychological, cultural, and political
28	characteristics of a dominant group.
29	B
30	Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently
31	aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by
32	tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led
33	movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government
34	until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for
35	the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies
36	associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks,
37	universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel
38	and its companies. And finally, the third component—sanctions—asks international
39	governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and
40	military agreements, among other measures.
41	C
42	Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on 43 a “free market” and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government.
44	Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as
45	research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately
46	exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated
47	from human labor and everything is commodified.
48	Character- A combination of qualities (i.e. mental, moral, ethical, etc.) that render a
49	person distinctly unique.
50	Chicana/o/x- A contested social and political identity chosen by people living in the
51	United States with Mexican and indigenous ancestry. The term with the ‘x’ is
52	pronounced with an ‘-ex’ sound at the end of the word.

1	What are the similarities and differences between the immigration patterns among Arabs throughout US history?
2.	What are the similarities and differences in the experiences of Arab groups after immigrating to America?
3.	How are the experiences of Arab immigrants connected to those of other communities?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Time Required: 100-150 minutes
•	Teacher distributes the “History of Arab Immigration to the United States” handout to students the day before the lesson. Depending on time, teacher can either have students read the handout for homework or as a warm up. Students are assigned to mark three points that surprised them and write out three questions they have after reading the handout.
•	Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as “Arab,” (e.g. predominantly Arabic-speaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)
•	Teacher has students take out the handout that they read for homework along with their questions. Teacher asks students to share what points surprised them. Teacher collects their questions and uses them to inform the next day of teaching. (5-10 min)

provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year.
The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was smaller (less than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. Immigrants both Christian and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for “Catastrophe,” the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.
Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and considered their Arab identity politically central. The term “Arab” is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. Iraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

Busta apologizes for being racist. Afterwards, students reflect on whether or not artists should be held solely responsible for reinforcing stereotypes. If not, who and/or what should be? (10-15 min)
•	Day 2: Teacher distributes song lyrics to the song, “Somos Sur” by Ana Tijoux and Shadia Mansour. Teacher introduces the song by explaining that:
“Somos Sur” is a song off Ana Tijoux’s latest album “Vengo". She collaborated on this song with Shadia Mansour, who is an Arab hip-hop artist from Palestine. Ana is from Chile, where her parents were exiled under the dictatorship of Pinochet a few years before she was born in France.
•	Students listen to the song and are instructed to do the following:
o While the video plays, try and follow along with the lyrics
o Underline 3 lines that stand out to you-either in English, Spanish, or Arabic
o Ana Tijoux is quoted as saying, “I feel that music is an amazing weapon, an amazing tool, like to have this reflection with the world. It’s a conversation, a dialogue with the world.”
o Using this song and your own personal experience with music, explain how music can be used as a weapon and how it can be used to give people agency?
♦ Students share their responses to the lyrics. Teacher specifically focuses on their responses to the quote by Ana Tijoux.
• Teacher distributes the assignment titled, Soundtrack of Hegemony. Students will explore their own experiences with hegemony. They will use the information they have used in the unit to create a cover for a CD that includes songs about

And set the standard straight about the violent circuit
From bomb makers stripping Islam Naked
The strong face of the wrong fakers, in calm nature, see
The truth in America's hip-hop is gone sacred
Not to generalize, dawg, this song's racist
[Outro]
So don't get it twisted
See not all Arabs are rich, my brothers and sisters
Get your history right
"Arab money' came from British colonialism
So that means the slave master got you back
So when you look at that money in your pocket
Make sure you spend it right
Letra de "Somos Sur" ft. Shadia Mansour
Tu nos dices que debemos sentarnos
Pero las ideas solo pueden levantarnos
Caminar, recorrer, no rendirse ni retroceder
Ver, aprender como esponja absorbe
Nadie sobra, todos faltan, todos suman
Todos para todos, todo para nosotros
Sohamos en grande que se caiga el imperio

Lyrics of "Somos Sur"
You tell us we should sit down
But ideas can only rise us
Walk, march, don't surrenderor retreat
See, learn like a sponge absorbs
No one is surplus, all fall short, all add up
All for all, all for us
We dream big that the empire may fall
We shout out loud, there is no other remedy left
This is not utopia, this is a joyful dancing rebellion
Of those who are overrun, this dance is yours and mine
Let's rise to say "enough is enough"
Neither Africa or Latin America are for auction
With mud, with a helmet, with a pencil, drum the fiasco
To provoke a social earthquake in this puddle
