b.	Have students look up “transcontinental railroad” in the index of their US
History textbook and have them look for text on Chinese laborers.

DJpMsandt=6s, tell the students to pay special attention to Connie Young Yu’s *
interview from 1:59-2:31. The whole video is 5:31 minutes.
Provide students time to reflect on what they have seen in the video by having students complete a five-minute free-write brainstorm on the following questions: Based on the interviews in the video, why is it important to recognize of the contributions of Chinese laborers? Why is that recognition meaningful to people within the Chinese-American community? How does the exclusion of Chinese   and Chinese-American contributions to the United States/including the railroad, affect our understanding of history?

^ After students have completed their free-write, have students assemble in pairs

or groups of three. Have students share their responses with one another. When the discussion begins to wind down, have the class reconvene as a whole group. Have students share their thoughts and ideas with the whole class.
^ Tell students that this video shows the importance of recognizing the

contributions of Chinese laborers more than one hundred years after the building of the railroad. Ask students these final questions: How do you think Chinese laborers and Chinese immigrants were treated at the time? Provide students with copies of excerpts from David Phillips’ discussion of “The Chinese Question,” Edward Holton’s observations about l^nniJ Kearney, and “Enactments So Utterly Un-American" by Constanc^Gordon-Cumming, which can all be found on the Library of Congress website:	^''WiOjs 1 (@ n£ 'V? nJ)
https://www.loc.qov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/pres entations/timeline/riseind/chinimms/. As students read, have them identify the conflicting attitudes towards the presence of Chinese laborers in California, noting the arguments presented for the exclusion and inclusion of Chinese laborers.
After students have read the document excerpts, explain to students that the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Have students look up this event in their textbooks and discuss with a partner whether or not they think the information provided is satisfactory. Have students come up with a list of questions they have about the Chinese Exclusion Act. ^hoLll^
