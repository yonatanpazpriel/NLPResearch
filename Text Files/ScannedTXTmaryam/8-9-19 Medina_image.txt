Ms. Soomin Chao
Chair, Instructional Quality Commission
California Department of Education 1430 N Street
Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
To Chairwomen Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
1 would like to thank you and the Commission for your leadership in developing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This work is extremely important and 1 commend your efforts in drafting a framework for school districts to use to implement Ethnic Studies in classrooms across the state.
However, 1 share the concerns of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and, as a signatory of its July 2611' letter; I am baffled by the omission of the American Jewish experience from the draft framework. As acts of anti-Semitism in the United States are increasing at an alarming rate, it is problematic to omit the history of Jews from the Model Curriculum. I believe the curriculum would be stronger if it were more comprehensive of additional groups’ experiences and would like the Commission to consider the inclusion of the European immigration history to demonstrate threads of commonality and comparisons across different ethnic groups. Additionally, the academic jargon used in the draft leads to a lack of clarity in the curriculum framework.
I appreciate the Commission’s open-feedback process and remain optimistic about the final product. I will continue to support this work and look forward to the development of a strong Ethnic Studies framework curriculum for California’s students.
Sincerely,
Jose Medina
Assemblymember, 61st District
