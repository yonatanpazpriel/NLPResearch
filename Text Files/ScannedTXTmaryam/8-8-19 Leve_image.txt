Dear Ms. Chao,
Having read a recent newspaper article which possibly overstates the Ethnic Studies curriculum issue, we still are concerned regarding: aspects of that proposed curriculum. As retired educators, we have background arid even research experience in some of the issues raised by the new curriculum guide.
Without access to the guide we would at this point urge caution in a hasty adoption of such a potentially controversial guide. I am sure that there are others better informed than we are, but we would suggest that there is still time for an in depth review of issues raised by this guide.
In the mid 1980’s when we were active educators, The California State Board of Education proposed revised California high school graduation requirements for all graduating students which would then qualify all students to enter into state universities and also the University of California — large numbers of our students would not have been able to meet these standards. Members of the Board of Education and staff of the Department of Education took this issue on the road and heard: aggressive opposition to the proposal. The result of public input was significant modification, if not actual scrapping, of these graduation standards .
We would suggest that time and reasoned input might achieve a more balanced approach to the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum guide as it exists in its current state.
