p4 lines 110-112: Students are not trained professionals so should not plan & teach a unit.
p17-18 lines 371-393 Some of the concepts can be easily turned inflammatory. Beware that you don't violate Ed Code sections 60040-60045 and 60048 as well as the guidelines in Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content, 2013 Edition.
p18 lines 391-393: Remove the last sentence regarding the "eradication of colonialism." This is inflammatory.
