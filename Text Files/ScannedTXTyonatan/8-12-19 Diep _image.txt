RE: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Chairwoman Chao:
I have serious concerns to the proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that is being considered by the Instructional Quality Commission. I was alerted that the curriculum is anti-Israel, omits any mention of anti-Semitism, and does not share the unique Jewish American experience.
Recently, I had a visit from Jewish leaders from my district at my Huntington Beach office. I received a very informative presentation on the history of anti-Semitism in the United States and around the world. It was an opportunity for me to learn, reflect, and better understand the nuances that infer anti-Semitism that is prevalent in our society today. In addition, I committed to being a voice whenever there are times of anti-Semitism. The draft curriculum before you does just that - discriminate against the Jewish community.
The purpose of an ethnic studies curriculum is to help students better understand different cultures, backgrounds, and beliefs. I oppose the current draft, as does the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, and urge the commission to return to the drawing board and find ways to include the history and pains the Jewish community has experienced.
Once again, the commission must make changes for the better to the current draft. Please do not hesitate to contact me or my chief of staff, Peter Kim if you have any questions.
Sincerely,
Assemblyman, 72nd District
California State Assembly
