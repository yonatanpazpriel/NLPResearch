Re: Proposed Anti-Israel Ethnic Studies
Dear Sir,
My Name is Gali Levi and I am a concerned parent of children in schools in the state of California.
I was really upset to see the proposed curriculum that does not include Jews as an ethnic group, calls to boycott divest and sanction Israel and more anti-Israel, Anti-Jew propaganda.
As a mother, I teach my children to respect and love others no matter of their, beliefs, ethnicity or background. I refuse to believe that the state of California approves such curriculum full of hate and misleading information.
I am asking you to please take action and remove these proposed studies from the curriculum. I would love to see more focus on teaching kids about accepting and respecting all people no matter of their backgrounds.
Looking forward to hear back from you.
Kind Regards,
Gali Levi
