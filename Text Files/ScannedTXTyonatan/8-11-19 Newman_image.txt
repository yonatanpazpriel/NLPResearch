Re: pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269. We urge the California Department of Education and Instructional Quality Commission to be aware of the extreme damage that this curriculum will have on Jewish students, especially of Sephardic/Mizrahi background, as well as the broader Jewish community in California. Unless revised, this curriculum promotes dangerous anti-Semitic tropes and factually incorrect information about Jews and Israel. This is especially alarming as Jewish students face growing anti-Semitism on college campuses. It also creates a narrative of hate that can lead to more tragedies, such as what happened recently at the synagogue in Poway California.
