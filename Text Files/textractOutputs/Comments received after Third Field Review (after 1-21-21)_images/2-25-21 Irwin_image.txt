To Whom It May Concern:
Ethnic Studies are college level courses not intended for grades K-12 in the Public Schools or any other lower-level academic institution for that matter. Young minds believe what adults' say and do without questioning action or motive.
Reading, Writing and Mathematics are necessary at all levels in grades K-12. We want our students to be academically prepared not brainwashed about Ethnic Studies during their formative years.
For shame all you so called educators involved with this curriculum. How can you live with yourselves? We want the best for our young people, not the worst kind of education.
