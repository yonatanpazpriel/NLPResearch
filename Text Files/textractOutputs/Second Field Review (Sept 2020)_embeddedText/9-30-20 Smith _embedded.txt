Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At a minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
If we don't understand where we have been, how can we anticipate where we are headed? CA is such a diverse state. I genuinely believe that is one of the gifts we offer to our nation. We can model successful multi-ethnic living, but we need to learn about and understand who we are. I didn't grow up in CA. I never learned about the JA internment camps in school. I didn't learn that Philipino-Americans were intimately involved in the beginnings of the Farm Labor movement in CA. My image of the history of Chinese in America was as male laborers who worked to

build the railroads, as laundry workers and opium-addled brothel workers. Much of this simplistic image was formed by movies and TV westerns. It would have been nice if those stereotypes were countered by what I was being taught in schools. Our history was so euro-centric. We focused on waves of German, Irish and Italian immigrants, but couldn't be bothered to learn about the Chinese Exclusion Act, or to learn about the history of the people in our country from many different Asian/South Asian nations. We didn't learn much about the history of those countries or how their residents came to this country. Now, I find myself surrounded by fellow citizens whose history I never studied and whose experiences I don't always understand. I hope my grandchildren (don't have any yet) will learn the history of their fellow classmate's parents and grandparents' unique histories as a central component of our CA school programs.
The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely, Becky Smith
