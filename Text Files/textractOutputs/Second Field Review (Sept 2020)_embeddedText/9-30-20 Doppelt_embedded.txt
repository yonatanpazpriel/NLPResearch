I am writing to you to ensure the Ethnics Studies Course is fair and unbiased. It should as a minimum cover Hispanic, AfroAmericans, American Indians and the history of other minorities that influenced the United States since its founding in 1776. In no case should it include disparaging information on foreign countries. This is not the purpose of an Ethnic Study course.
Thank you,
