Dear Sir /Madame
Having read the draft in its total, I find it disturbing that what should be a curriculum on understanding the ethnic differences and issues within the US has become a vehicle for neo Marxist thought of dubious accuracy. One can point to many examples, but there is an underlying, one sided agenda that comes through that as a citizen of this proud state and country, cannot be supported. Having watched the real atrocities imposed by these ideologies in the 20th century, and having lived the beneficial impact that the United States has had in general, I find this one sidedness to be suspect and not fit for what is supposed to be education, as opposed to indoctrination. I plan to take this up with my state representatives as well and hold them accountable for their decisions.
Regards
Michael Lewis
