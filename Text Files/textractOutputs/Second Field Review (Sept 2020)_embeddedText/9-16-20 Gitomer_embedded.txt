Hello,
Thank you for your time and energy in ensuring that our California school children are educated about all peoples, races, and ethnicities. I have heard that there could again be changes and I am so afraid that there could lessons that teach of hate rather than understanding. I hope that you will seriously review the curriculum to ensure that there is not anti-Semitic language or anti-Israel messages before the public commenting period is over. I truly hope with all of my heart that you can keep BDS and anti-Jewish sentiment out of the curriculum. We all want a better world for our next generation.
Best Regards, Lynn Gitomer
