I understand that under California's AB 331, California high school students will be required to complete an Ethnic Studies course to graduate.
On August 12, the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum. Unfortunately, the antisemitic and anti-Israel bias in the 2019 draft was found in the lesson plan.
As a member of the Jewish community, I have a special duty to speak out and stand up when we experience injustice.
As someone born in Los Angeles, a U.C.L.A. graduate, and a current California resident, I implore you to correct this lesson plan NOW!
