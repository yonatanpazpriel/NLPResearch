Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
On behalf of the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California (JPAC), we want to express our appreciation to the California Department of Education for listening to public comment and heeding the calls by the State Board of Education leadership and Governor Newsom to make significant changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in order to improve its alignment with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines, Education Code, and vision as set out in AB 2016.
We greatly value the opportunity to comment on this draft. The enclosed review provides recommendations aimed at ensuring internal consistency and alignment--and corrects for critical omissions. We appreciate your commitment to ensuring high quality public education in general and for your commitment to improving the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, in particular, so that it is of the highest quality and adheres to California values, standards, and law.
JPAC is the largest single-state coalition of Jewish organizations in the nation. We advocate in Sacramento on behalf of our members, which are comprised of Jewish Federations, Jewish Community Relations Councils, Jewish Family Service agencies, and many Jewish community organizations.
CDE's revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is a commendable improvement over the first draft, and yet, the second draft also requires revision. In particular, we recommend: � the addition of a keyword definition for antisemitism consistent with other keyword
definitions � the addition of language from the Education Code and History-Social Science
Framework that protects students, supports an atmosphere of open inquiry, and will ultimately allow ethnic studies classrooms to achieve the desired positive outcomes expressed in the model curriculum � the addition of a lesson highlighting the experiences and diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jews of color and Jews from the Middle East

While we were shocked by the inclusion of denigrating content on Jews, Israelis, and Israel in the first draft, and glad to see the removal of such hateful content in the second draft, we ask for your continued vigilance against the reinsertion of such material, particularly when, in 2019, California saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents in recent years.
JPAC is writing on behalf of the following organizations: Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin, Sonoma, Alameda and Contra Costa Counties; Jewish Community Federation and Endowment Fund (Bay Area); Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles; Community Relations Council of the Jewish Federation of Silicon Valley; Jewish Federation of the Sacramento Region; Jewish Long Beach; Jewish Federation of the Greater San Gabriel and Pomona Valleys; Rose Project of the Jewish Federation and Family Services Orange County; Jewish Federation of Greater Santa Barbara; and Jewish Federation of Ventura County.
Our organizations are grateful to you, the members of the Instructional Quality Commission, for your consideration of the recommended changes detailed in the enclosed review. We appreciate your time and dedication, and the opportunity to provide input. We look forward to participating in the process and to seeing the adoption of a high quality Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that will lift up and enrich the educational experience of all California students.
Sincerely,
Lynn Bunim Chair Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California (JPAC)
