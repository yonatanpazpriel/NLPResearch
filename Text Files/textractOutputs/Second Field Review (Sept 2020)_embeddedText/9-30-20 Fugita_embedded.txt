From: Stephen Fugita Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
Dear Superintendent Thurmond:
I believe that Japanese Americans should be included in the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum because of their significant contribution to California agriculture as well as their unconstitutional treatment during WWII.
Respectfully,
Stephen S. Fugita, Ph.D
