From: Yvette Lee Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 1:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Petition to include Korean American Studies ..
Dear Sir/ Madam at California Department of Education (`CDE'),
My name is Yvette Lee and I am a first-generation immigrant, working in the legal profession.
I would like to request that the CDE incorporates lesson plans on Korean Americans into the draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum adopted in November 2020 by the Instructional Quality Commission.
The State of California has started recognizing Korean American Day from January 13, 2020, by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 143, which declares that "with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean Immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be contributing Korean Americans.'
Also, the State of California has set up the Hangul (Korean Language) Day on October 19, 2019, and recognizes the Korean American community as "an integral part of mainstream American society" that has "made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas."
I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section, and request you to include.
Thank you in advance, Sincerely yours,
Yvette Lee
