It is very unfortunate that the proposed curriculum still falls short and allows for those of Irish and Jewish decent to be shown in a negative and demeaning manner.
Please return to the drawing board and fix these egregious oversights before making this the basis for the curriculum. It is unacceptable the way it currently stands.
