From: Blair Fingerhut Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 8:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Do not pass, it is not a balance curriculum- from a LCSW working with teens as well as parent of high school student in San Mateo County.
I am a mother of a sophomore in San Mateo High School school district in Northern California.
I'm also a licensed clinical social worker who works with teens in San Mateo California.
This curriculum is not balanced to the Jewish population.
Thank you for your time.
Blair Fingerhut, LCSW
