Hi there. I appalled at the board of education's lack of acknowledgement when it comes to providing an education that is anti-Semitic. There are no Jewish American experiences in the curriculum that teach students about anti-Semitism, there needs to be exclusion about the Boycott, Divestment Sanctions movement, this was created by anti-Semitic individuals who are consistently holding Israel to another standard vs. other countries in the Middle East that do not respect women and members of the LGBTQ community and there needs to be sample lessons reflecting diversity of Jewish American in children's curriculum. Please do what is right!
We pay our taxes, we deserve the right to be heard! Thank you!
