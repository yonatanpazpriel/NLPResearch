From: Sarah Kim Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 9:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] AB 331 - Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section
Dear California Department of Education
The Korean American community has long helped shape the American landscape through its activities, contributions, and more. For example, we cannot discuss the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest without referencing Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose during that period, and how this contributed to the violence and marginalization of minority groups. This incident implies a significant lesson for unity and solidarity among minority groups. It was also a turning point for many Korean Americans to realize the importance of civic engagement. Korean American experiences and interethnic relations would be very powerful topics for California students to learn how to cooperate with each other in the diverse community of California.
The Korean American community's presence, impact, and history are significant and an important part of ethnic studies education. To exclude the Korean American community in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum would be to ignore a major part of California's and America's heart and soul. Thus, I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans is yet again another act of marginalization and discrimination. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Sung Kim
