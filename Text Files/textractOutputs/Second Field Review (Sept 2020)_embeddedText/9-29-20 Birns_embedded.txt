From: JEFFREY W BIRNS Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns
Dear CDE,
My name is Dr. Jeffrey Birns and I live in Los Angeles.
As a loyal American and an American Jew, I am deeply offended and outraged at some of the written materials included within the Ethnic Studies Curriculum in California regarding American Jews and Israel.
The proposed chapter on American Jews teaches that Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnic group.. There are citations in the curriculum from sources that promote BDS (which most informed people, including our government and the German Parliament, consider an anti-Semitic movement.) At a time in our history when hatred and division are part of the daily discourse in the news, when the Jewish community has been the target of violent and fatal attacks, the proposed curriculum only serves to fuel misunderstanding and more hatred.
You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public.
I demand that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools, and that you re-write the chapter on Jewish Americans to be more accurate and inclusive. Furthermore, there is a grave issue of an apparent lack of transparency here, which I strongly urge you to address forthwith.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey Birns MD [Address Redacted] Tarzana, CA
