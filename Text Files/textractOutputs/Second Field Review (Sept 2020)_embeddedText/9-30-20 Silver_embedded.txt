From: Jeff Silver Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:03 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Second ESMC Draft Comments
As native Californian and a parent of two children and a small business owner, I urge the Instructional Quality Commission to create a balanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that includes a lesson about antisemitism with an accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
Please remove any antisemitic or anti-Israel bias in the lesson plan on Arab Americans.
Sincerely,
Jeff Silver President Rough Draft Brewing Company
