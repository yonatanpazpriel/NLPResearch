To Tony Thurmond,
Ethnic courses and the importance of them will always be a debatable topic. However, taking ethnic courses to learn about your ancestors achievements, down falls, and significance is so important. We only see white men writing history because they're considered winners. Let change that and start educating students on their ethnicity and there significance, so one day they can make a change.
Thank you, Destiny Garia
