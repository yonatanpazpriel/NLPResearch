This is California is 2020. Why in the world would the CALIFORNIA Department of Education Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ignore the history of Japanese Americans in the United States and, specifically, in CALIFORNIA?! Why would any of the AAPI groups that have contributed to the diversity and strength of this state be ignored? This is the last state in the United States in which I would expect to see this happen.
