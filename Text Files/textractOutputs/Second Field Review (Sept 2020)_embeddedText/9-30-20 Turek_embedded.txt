Dear CDE,
I was absolutely appalled to read that you are working with groups who wish to add BDS to California state curriculum. I was under the impression that you had guaranteed that you would keep Anti-Semitism and BDS out of our CA state curriculum. To hear that you are openly consulting with organizations whose primary intent is to add BDS and Anti-Semitic inclusions is quite frightening to me and my family as well as our friends. And what's this I am hearing about some secret chapter that has not even been made public? This is sickening! My family and I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and Anti-Semitism out of our schools.
Disgusted, Lisa Danielle Turek
