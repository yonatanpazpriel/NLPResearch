From: Pam Matsuoka Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: APISBMA. Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Japanese American history in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I was informed that the history of Japanese Americans is not being included in the most recent draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This history, which impacted my own family, should be included.
The period just before, during, and after World War II is especially critical to include in the curriculum. It not only illustrates the impact of racism and politics on this Asian American community but also on our current communities of color, on immigrants, and refugees in the United States. And the work of many Japanese Americans and civil rights leaders led to redress and reparations many years later. This history should not be forgotten and is an indispensable learning tool for the future.
Thank you for your work on the curriculum and for including this key period of history which our future generations need to understand.
Sincerely, Pam Matsuoka Oakland, CA
