Dear madam/ Sir,
I have spent over 37 years studying the Middle East. I have found that there are people who do not and will not recognize the over 3500 years of the Jewish people having self rule in what is Israel. The country was conquered and occupied by people from the Arabian peninsula in the 600's. Much later on, in the 1947-8 time period, the Jewish people regained self-rule in Israel.
In addition, in the 1900's all the Jewish people living in Middle East and North African countries outside of Israel had life made very difficult. Worse than that, in many of those countries, Jews were forcibly removed from those countries and were forced to leave their possessions, homes and businesses behind. This group of Jewish people had ancestors living in those countries long before those countries were also conquered and colonized by the people from the Arabian peninsula. Also Jews living in the non-Arabic Middle East countries also were given a difficult time.
Those facts are found in many historical research books and papers.
One example was a book written by the first president of Brandies University. It is well written and has extensive references throughout the book.
Fortunately, the relationship of a number of the Arabic countries with Israel is changing for the better and is backed by peace agreements with Israel.
Also, one of the events in the Middle East that is most likely not talked about is that one half of a million Palestinians have been removed from Kuwait because the Palestinians were on the wrong side of the Kuwait ï¿½ Iraq war. It is unlikely that event is in the curriculum.

It is my understanding the above facts are being ignored in the curriculum and therefore distorting the picture of history of Israel and of the Jewish people..
The actions by those who are putting together the curriculum is such that it can be seen as a political move with AntiSemitic overtones with an impact that will distort and convince children to hate Jewish people.
Such a curriculum should never be accepted for teaching
I appreciate your taking time to learn of the facts.
Thank you kindly,
