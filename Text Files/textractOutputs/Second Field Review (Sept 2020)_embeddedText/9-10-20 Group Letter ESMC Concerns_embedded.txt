Dear California Department of Education,
While I was happy to hear about the many revisions made to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum that removed antisemitism and BDS, I'm concerned to hear about the lack of transparency about an additional chapter added to the lesson plan. The protocol of allowing the public to review the curriculum and comment on it allows constituents to hold the CDE to its commitment against discrimination, as promised when revising the first draft. I ask that the CDE stand by its previous pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum, and to open the additional sample chapter up to fair and transparent review prior to the closing of the comment period on September 30th. I'm also concerned about some of the materials of the curriculum, such as the use of the book, Education at War, as well as the misleading and harmful discussion of Jewish Americans attaining racial privilege. Please make these changes and make it a curriculum that everyone can learn from without fear of discrimination.
