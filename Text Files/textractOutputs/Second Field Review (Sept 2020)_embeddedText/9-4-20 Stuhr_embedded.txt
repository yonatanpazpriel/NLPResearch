From: Lisa Stuhr Sent: Thursday, September 3, 2020 8:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove BLM from curriculum
I am raising a family with a member of Law Enforcement and will not support or enroll my children in a school system that supports educating children about biased content regarding BLM as anything other then domestic terrorists. This is promoting anti-police mentality and it is extremely dangerous to the safety and well-being of our community. This content must be removed.
Sincerely,
Lisa Stuhr
