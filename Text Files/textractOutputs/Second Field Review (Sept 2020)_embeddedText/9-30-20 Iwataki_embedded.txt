Hello,
It has come to our attention that the CA Department of Education (CDE) Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) will not be including curriculum addressing the history of Japanese Americans despite a yearlong effort by the state-wide board of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA).
Our country is experiencing a growing racial divide which is impacting all of our families and communities across the country. Now more than ever we need voices to speak for healing and unifying the nation. This is not something that can be accomplished overnight. It is imperative that California's educational institutions include the contributions and loss of civil liberties of Japanese Americans, and the important historical lessons that can be applied to help understand and improve the policies that are threatening other communities today.
We join with other Japanese American and Asian American and Pacific Islander groups in calling for the inclusion of JA history as well as the history of the larger AAPI community.
Thank you, Miya Iwataki, Vice President Little Tokyo Historical Society - name for identification purposes only
