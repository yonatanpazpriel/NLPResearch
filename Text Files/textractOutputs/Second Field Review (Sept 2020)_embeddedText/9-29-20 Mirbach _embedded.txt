From: Susan Mirbach Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 2:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Our family supports Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies proposals
We support the requests of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies which you recently received to remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles" and resulting lessons by:
� Removing the inflammatory "Guiding Values and Principles" which can bring hate and political dogma into the classroom.
� Aligning all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes. � Adding Elements of a Balanced Curriculum for safeguards against politicizing Ethnic Studies. � Excluding BDS and other one-sided political conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts. � Including approaches to social change that work within the system to improve it. Sincerely, Bill, Susan, Kenlyn and Marissa Mirbach
