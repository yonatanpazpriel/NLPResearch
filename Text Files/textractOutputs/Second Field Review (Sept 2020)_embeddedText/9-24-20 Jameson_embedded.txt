Hello!
I'd like to provide my comment on the proposal to mandate ethnic studies in k-12 education: please focus on the basics, instead of adding extras. California's educators have plenty of work to do ensuring that students are able to read, write, and figure. As an English teacher, I'm surprised by the stated purpose of ethnic studies to " develop students to be able to effectively and powerfully read, write, speak, and think critically, and engage in school," which I have thus far understood to be my job and that of history teachers, speech and debate instructors, et cetera. As a parent, I am disturbed by the stated goal to encourage students to become social justice organizers and advocates, which I believe is my purview as a mother, especially since I am unconvinced that I would trust California educators to select causes for which to advocate.
I urge you to scrap the proposed ethnic studies requirement in favor of concentrating efforts in California's schools toward less divisive measures and more basic skills that all citizens can agree are necessary for students. Thank you for your consideration.
Regards,
Beth Jameson
