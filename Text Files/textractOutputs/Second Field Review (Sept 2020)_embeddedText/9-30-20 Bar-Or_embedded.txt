From: Karen Bar-Or Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 4:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum Public Commenting - Israeli-American Community
Dear members of the IQC,
Please find attached a petition voicing the concerns of 7,705 signatories, members of the IsraeliAmerican and Jewish communities in reference to the upcoming vote on the Ethnic Studies curriculum.
In this petition our community members ask that:
1. The CDE take action by further improving the ESMC to remove references to biased anti-Israel content, as well as immediately issuing a policy guidance memo to all district school boards regarding national origin discrimination. Such a memo would help them understand how to detect harmful content such as BDS and antisemitic rhetoric, when they are presented with it.
2. District school boards acknowledge the responsibility and power vested in them by refraining from voting to support or implement supplemental curriculum that includes BDS, or any other harmful or antisemitic rhetoric that is new or was removed from the previous draft, and by thoroughly researching any proposed content.
3. Educators understand that social movements taught about in ethnic studies courses should aim to improve the lives of minorities in America. The BDS movement harms minority groups in America and does advocacy related to a foreign conflict that should fall outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses. Referencing this hateful movement would contradict the goals of the ESMC, as BDS promotes hate and discrimination based on national origin.
You have the power to stop hatred from entering our children's classrooms ï¿½ please do not neglect it.
Sincerely,
Karen Bar-Or National Activism Director Israeli-American Council (IAC)
