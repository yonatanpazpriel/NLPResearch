As important as the concept of Ethnic Studies is to our country and its history, I must comment on the focus of anti Semitism and how narrow the current language is. We are, as American Jews, a multinational group that identifies as various cultures. We are not one people. With the large number of students who either have no knowledge of the Holocaust or are deniers, it's imperative that a clear and open explanation be available. I close with the hope that everyone will 'have a seat at the table' in the creation of a concept that will influence not just California but possibly the curricula throughout the student population of other states. With appreciation, Gayle Wise
