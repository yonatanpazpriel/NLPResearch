Dear members of the instructional quality commission:
I am supportive of Ethnic studies for high schooler, but I have deep concern about the current Aug. 2020 draft.
I would like to add my support for following two requests for revision.
One from Genuine ethnic studies curriculum that comply with California history-social studies framework 2016. The other is from Alliance for constructive Ethnic studies.
Again, I am deeply concern and not agree with Aug. 2020 draft.
Thank you
Qian zhao
