"Resistance The word resistance usually implies some form of armed uprising. Although a few such incidents occurred, they were rare, and as history has shown, ineffectual. Furthermore, resistance on the part of a single individual usually met with instant death or random retaliation against others."
This is a quote from your curriculum on genocide with respect to Jewish resistance to the Nazis. Page 50 of your pdf.
In fact, there were numerous acts of resistance to the Nazis by Jews, despite the danger. There was an underground resistance movement plus there was the Warsaw ghetto uprising. Please add these to your curriculum, rather than characterizing Jews as cowards and wimps, which is the usual way that Jews are portrayed.
Thanks Lois
