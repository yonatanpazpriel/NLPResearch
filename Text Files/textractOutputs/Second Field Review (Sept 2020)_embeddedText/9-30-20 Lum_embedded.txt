From: raymond lum Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Japanese American History EXCLUSION
Dear Fellow Educators,
Why would you exclude Japanese American history from the California ethnic studies curriculum, when the history and treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II, is the model for what and why we do not want to repeat that part of history ever again in the United States of America?
Please think of the grave mistake this would be, and the message this would send if Japanese American history is removed from the "model" ethnic studies curriculum.
