Dear Superintendent Tony Thurmond, As a daughter of an incarcee of the American Concentration Camps, it is imperative that students know the history and contributions of Japanese Americans. I am an artist who has brought this history to light, and it is still startling for me to meet people who know nothing about our history and learn it for the first time while viewing my work in a gallery. If we are erased from education, this will continue to happen.
Asians deserve and need a place in ethnic studies. We make up a large segment of the American population and have made significant contributions. With on going discrimination throughout US history and even today -this is even more important for understanding and education.
thank you for your support,
Na Omi Judy Shintani, Narrator of Culture the unspoken compels me to create.
