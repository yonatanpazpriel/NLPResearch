Dear Ethnic Studies Curriculum Developers,
I'm impressed with the work that's already been done on building the Ethnic Studies course. I agree the focus should be on African American, Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x, Native American, and Asian American studies, as it seems to now.
Please don't veer from this direction.
Best regards, Tricia Barr parent and Site Council member
