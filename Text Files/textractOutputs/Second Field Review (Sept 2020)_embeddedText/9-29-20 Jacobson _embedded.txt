To whom it may concern,
I do not live in California, but in Decatur, GA. Nevertheless, I am worried that curricula in schools and colleges in the US, where I was born and grew up, are being developed with inaccurate and potentially dangerous assumptions.
Wrong ideas find their way insidiously into mainstream beliefs if they receive broad enunciation. To wit, in the proposed program:
Citations � Citations in this curriculum are from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel authors. Whether or not one agrees with Israeli policies, there are three issues with such citations: o BDS treats Israel differently from all other nations, applying standards to policy that are not applied elsewhere, and demanding punitive measures that are not demanded elsewhere. o BDS has a strong anti-Jewish component that is independent of Israeli governmental activities. It accuses Jews -- both in Israel and in the US -- of perpetrating actions it finds unjust, and calls this genocide. o A source that supports BDS becomes authoritative when included in a bibliography, and even if the source says nothing offensive in the cited materials, other materials will likely contain inaccurate or offensive or bigoted.
American Jews Chapter
� Material teaches that Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnicity. Jews may be successful, but Jews have never been privileged.
� It is frightening for any American Jew due to the rise in antisemitism during the last year o Jewish Americans are compared to white supremacists o Jews are blamed for racial injustice in America.
� Jews have never stopped being discriminated against or hated. Jews have been the target of several violent and deathly attacks, recently as well as historically.
For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the targeted hatred we experience.
I ask you to do the following:
� I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by o Removing all citations that include anti-Israel or anti-Jewish sentiment o Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative o Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS.
Thank you Edward Jacobson
