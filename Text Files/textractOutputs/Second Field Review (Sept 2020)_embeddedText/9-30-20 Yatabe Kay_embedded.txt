Dear Superintendent Thurman,
It is very important that Japanese American history is included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Our history includes the World War II incarceration of all Americans of Japanese descent, regardless of citizenship. This is a warning to other ethnic groups of what can happen in times of "national emergency".
The current issue of "Teaching Tolerance", from the Southern Poverty Law Center includes the article "We Still Haven't Learned From This; Japanese American incarceration stories are American stories that need to be told".
This is a story that is important for all ethnicities to know.
Thank you.
Sincerely, Kay Yatabe, MD
