Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
As Vice Chair of the California Asian Pacific Islander (API) Legislative Caucus, I thank you for the opportunity to provide comments regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) draft. I appreciate the efforts of Superintendent Tony Thurmond and the California Department of Education to incorporate stakeholder input in the most recent revision.
I respectfully request revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020. First, please restore the lesson plans on Asians and Pacific Islanders (API) as a pan-ethnic group, as well as on Cambodian Americans, that were present in the July 2019 draft.
Additionally, with more than thirty ethnicities within the diverse Asian and Pacific Islander community, I support additional lesson plans to include Indian Americans, Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Sikh Americans, Vietnamese Americans and other API sub-groups. California is home to the largest API population in the nation, and the next revision of the ESMC must represent the diversity of this population.
As the only Japanese American Member of the California State Legislature, I make sure that each year, the Legislature commemorates February 19 as a statewide Day of Remembrance, to remember the unjust incarceration of Japanese Americans in concentration camps without due process of law during World War II. Lessons on the history of Japanese Americans in the State of California, and its relevance to present-day discrimination against Muslim Americans and immigrants, should be part of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to having ongoing discussions with Superintendent Thurmond, IQC and the State Board of Education as the process moves forward.
Sincerely,
