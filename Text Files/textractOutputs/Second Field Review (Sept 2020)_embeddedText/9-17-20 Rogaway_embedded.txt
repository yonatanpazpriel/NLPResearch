Hello, I am a retired librarian in the California Public School. I read the curriculum and feel that the Jews are treated badly as presented. There is no information on the Jewish contribution to America, the anti-semitism they experienced, the quotas, the rejection, the exclusive neighborhoods, and on and on. They are left out except for Israel and the BDS movement, and that is from a bias point of view. It is such a lopsided curriculum. I am sure there were no Jews on the Committee. The hate that Jews have received for many generations is not remarked on and there is no comment on the Holocaust. This does not reflect the Jews in any way. This is not a complete or fair Curriculum. Check the Oregon "Intersectionality" and see where the course should start - with the real children in each class. This is not a one size fits all acceptable Curriculum. Sincerely, Helen Rogaway, retired School Librarian; BHUSD (different schools have different populations and that has not been taken into consideration!)
