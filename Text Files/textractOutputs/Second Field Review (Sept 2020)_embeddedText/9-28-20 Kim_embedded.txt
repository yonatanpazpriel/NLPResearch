Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Committee:
Dasom Korean School in Sunnyvale CA, in partnership with the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) requests to include the lesson plans of Korean Americans. Korean Americans represent one of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
Since the 1965 amendments to the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, Korean Americans have become one of the fastest growing groups of Asian Americans in the United States. According to 2010 US census, 1,706,822 people with some Korean ancestry lived in the United States, representing more than a 67-fold increase since 1960.
With diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans.
Nowadays Korean Americans have become an integral part of mainstream American society and have made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as other areas.
As a Korean American and the principal of Dasom Korean School, I urge you to include the lesson plans of Korean American in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I hope all the students in California can learn more about ethnic minority groups through ethnic studies classes soon.
Sincerely,
Miyoung Kim   Principal, Dasom Korean School www.dasomks.org / mydasom@dasomks.org
