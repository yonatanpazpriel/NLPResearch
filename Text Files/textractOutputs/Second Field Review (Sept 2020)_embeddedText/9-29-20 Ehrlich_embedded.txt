From: Michelle Ehrlich Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 10:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Antisemitism by the California Department of Education will NOT be tolerated
BDS organizations are trying to force the California Department of Education to put Antisemitism, BDS, and antizionism back into the curriculum.
After the CDE got rid of these hateful things from their curriculum, BDS is trying to put it back into a new lesson plan chapter that no one is allowed to see until the public commenting period is over.
As a parent in California, I demand transparency and make sure that the CDE stands by its pledge of excluding BDS and antisemitism from school lessons!
