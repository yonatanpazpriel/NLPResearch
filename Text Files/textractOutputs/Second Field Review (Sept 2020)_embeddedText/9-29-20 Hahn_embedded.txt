Dear people who are responsible for the education of California children and adolescents:
The ethnic studies curriculum as it now stands is flawed in that it ignores antisemitism towards American Jews. Please be mindful that not all Jews are Ashkenazi. Some are refugees from Arab countries and some are African Americans and some are Chinese. Please take into account that anti semitism is WRONG and must be taught as such. Thank you.
