Re: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Commissioners:
The Chinese Historical Society of America, (CHSA) supports the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) with respect to its request for revisions to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020. Such revisions include:
1. Restoring lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: (a) Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community; and (b) Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. Including, at a minimum, additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
Since 1963, CHSA has been dedicated to the interpretation, promotion, and preservation of the social, cultural and political history and contributions of the Chinese in America. We serve thousands of educators and students through our curriculum, museum exhibits, tours and workshops, our audiences learn about American history through the eyes of Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans.
The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3.

We urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November. Please feel free e-mail me if you have any questions. Thank you.
Sincerely,
CHINESE HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA
