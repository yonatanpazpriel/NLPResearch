Your curriculum on genocide does not mention the Rwandan genocide of Hutus vs Tutsis. Please add that in to your curriculum. It also does not mention the Rape of Nanking by the Japanese. Please also add that. Are you trying to give the impression to the students if California that only white people commit genocide?
