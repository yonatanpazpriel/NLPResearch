From: addasa nudelman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 9:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles"
I support the requests of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies which you recently received to remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles" and resulting lessons by:
� Removing the inflammatory "Guiding Values and Principles" which can bring hate and political dogma into the classroom.
� Aligning all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes. � Adding Elements of a Balanced Curriculum for safeguards against politicizing Ethnic Studies. � Excluding BDS and other one-sided political conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts. � Including approaches to social change that work within the system to improve it. Sincerely, A. Nudelman
