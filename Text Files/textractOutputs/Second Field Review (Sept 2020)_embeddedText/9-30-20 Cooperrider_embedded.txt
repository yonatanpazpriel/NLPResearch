Hello, I am a community member concerned about students having a good understanding of the different groups that have contributed and do contribute to our multi-cultural society. I also care about how my Asian-American friends and neighbors are treated, and I think there is a connection between greater understanding and more respectful interactions.
I therefore ask you to honor the requests of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) for a fuller curriculum regarding AAPI cultures.
Thank you.
