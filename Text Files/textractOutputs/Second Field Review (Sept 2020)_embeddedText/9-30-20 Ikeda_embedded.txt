Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission:
Densho supports the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community, and Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
Since its founding in 1996, Densho has preserved and shared the history of the World War II Japanese American incarceration to promote justice and equity today. Education is at the heart of our mission and we have always prioritized our work with students and teachers.
The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely,
Tom Ikeda Executive Director
