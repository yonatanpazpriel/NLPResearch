From: Liang-Fang Chao Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies; IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comparison of Guiding Principles Between the Drat ESMC and LAUSD Curriculum
A side-by-side comparison below could help us understand the difference between the regular Ethnic Studies course versus the one drafted in the ESMC (so-called "Critical Ethnic Studies").
The content below is included in this blog article:
https://better-ethnic-studies.blogspot.com/2020/09/comparison-of-guiding-principles.html
The comments sent in by Better Ethnic Studies are based on this comparison. Thus, I am including it here for your reference and record. I hope you include such a comparison table in the Model Curriculum as resources for the teachers.

The Ethnic Studies course has been taught in Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) for many years. Their Guiding Principles are more closely aligned with the current "History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools", adopted in 2016. Here are documents for Ethnic Studies from LAUSD:

Comparison of Guiding Principles Between Drat ESMC and LAUSD Curriculum

So-called "Critical" Ethnic Studies
ESMC Guiding Principles

Regular Ethnic Studies (closely aligned with HistorySocial Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016) LAUSD Guiding Principles

G1

#2 celebrate and honor

The course examines the

Native People/s of the land experiences, histories,

and communities of color struggles and victories of

by providing a space to share ethnic and cultural groups...

their stories of struggle and

resistance, along with their

intellectual and cultural

wealth;

G2

The course examines how

race and ethnicity have

been constructed in the

United States, have changed

over time, and continue to

shape the country today

(History-Social Science

Framework for California

Public Schools, 2016).

G3

G5

The course concentrates on

building the capacity of

students to interact

G8

#5 challenge

The course will teach

imperialist/colonial [18]

students to examine

beliefs and practices on

colonialism, its significance

multiple levels[19]

historically, and its

[18] and hegemonic [19] Ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized

significance to their own ancestral legacies.

G9

The course will develop

student perspectives and

modes of thoughtful judgment

designed to extend critical

thinking(History-Social

Science Framework for

California Public Schools,

2016, p.744).

G10

The course will include

curriculum, resources, and

materials, including a

balance of topics, authors,

and concepts, including

primary and secondary

sources that represent

multiple, and sometimes

opposing, points of view or

perspectives (History-

SocialScience Framework for

California Public Schools,

2016).

G11

#7 conceptualize, imagine,

and build new possibilities for

post-imperial life that

promotes collective

narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radical healing.

ESMC Draft

LAUSD Guidance on Social Justice

S1

Comment: No such emphasis "Students will become aware

on the awareness of change of the constant themes of

of definition over time

social justice and

responsibility, while

recognizing these are

defined differently over

time" (History-Social Science

Framework for California

Public Schools, p. 420).

S2

Comment: No such emphasis An ethnic studies course

on "depth of understanding" should provide students with

or "scientific inquiry" rather depth of understanding in

than "promoting specific

relation to ethnic and social

political activism,

issues, rather than

demonstration, protest or the promoting specific political

like".

activism, demonstration,

protest or the like. Ethnic

studies is a scientific

inquiry of ethnic groups and

their interrelations (Yang,

2010, pg. 14)

S3

Comment: No such

Should include examples of

emphasis to advocate with civic engagement (e.g.,

existing system and through voting and other peaceful

nonviolent activities.

social justice activities) and

the impact they have had on

United States history.

Students who are considering

volunteering, social justice

activities, community

engagement, etc., should

consult with their school

teacher/advisor and

parents/guardians to

evaluate that the activities

are lawful, peaceful,and

nonviolent.

S4

"Whenever possible, should

[create] opportunities for

participation and for reflection on the responsibilities of citizens in a free society" (History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools,2016,p. 19).

Access and Equity Pedagogy Principles in LAUSD

A1

Attend to the varied

student populations in the

classroom by embracing

diversity as an asset for

engaging in rich and

rigorous instruction. Ethnic

studies is inclusive of

students and families from a

wide range of cultural, ethnic,

sexual orientation, race,

class, gender,

socioeconomic, linguistic,

and ability backgrounds.

A2

2. Explicitly teach the

academic skills, habits of

mind, and rhetorical

strategies that are

employed when engaging

in reading, writing,

speaking, and thinking in

the area of ethnic studies.

Ethnic studies teachers

should expose students to a

variety of instructional

practices and techniques

designed to assist students in

identifying the strategies and

appeals employed in text or

visual media. Effective

instruction embeds the critical

aspects of thinking in the

history/social science and

literature disciplines,

including explicit modeling

and practice with sourcing,

contextualizing, and corroborating evidence (Wineburg 1991, Seixas 2009, De La Paz 2013).
