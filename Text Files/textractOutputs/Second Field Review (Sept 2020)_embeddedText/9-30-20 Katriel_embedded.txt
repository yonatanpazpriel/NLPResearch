From: lisa katriel Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 10:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please Revise the current version of the Ethnic Studies curriculum to remove antiSemitic and anti-Israel language
> As the parent of a high school freshman, I am writing to express my serious concerns about the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum. The curriculum as it stands fails to include a lesson plan on American Jews and yet has reinserted anti-semitic and anti-Israel language as part of a lesson plan on Arab Americans. This curriculum's intent is to teach tolerance and inclusion. As currently drafted it denigrates Jews. While this should be unacceptable under any circumstances, this is absolutely reprehensible in the climate of intolerance and injustice that so many Americans are currently fighting against. Failing to include appropriate content on American Jews (and their diversity) and anti-semitism as a form of bigotry does a disservice to our students, who are our future leaders, and perpetuates a climate of intolerance that has a negative impact on all of us in California and across the United States. I request that the CDE and IQC correct the current anti-semitic bias and commit to an opportunity for comment on all phases of a final Ethnic Studies curriculum. > > Sincerely, Lisa Katriel
