I believe a curriculum about ethnic studies and prejudice has been drawn up that leaves antisemitism out of the discussion. Even if you disregard millenia of historical experience and focus on the present, Jews are among the most targeted groups in the United States (fact, not Fake News) today. Attacks on us are becoming more frequent and more deadly. This omission would immediately make the curriculum outdated and - dare I say it - prejudiced.
