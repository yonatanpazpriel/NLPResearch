From: HEIDI LEVIN Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Please keep bias out of the classroom. The current curriculum being considered for ESMC has antisemtic and anti-Israel bias. Develop a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes diversity of the Jewish community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi and Jews of color. Please include an accurate definition of antisemitism and include lessons about antisemitism. Antisemitism is at the highest rate since World War II. It's time to teach an unbiased view of Jews. Please allow for public comment in all phases of the development of the final ESMC.
Sincerely,
Heidi Levin
