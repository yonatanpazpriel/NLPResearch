This Op Ed which contains a long list of recent antisemitic incidents includes one which is of particular interest to me because it is an instance of clear governmental discrimination against Jews. "In the past three months we've seen the California Board of Education go ahead with an ethnic studies curriculum that is openly anti-Semitic and anti-Israel as a part of it's effort to promote diversity and understanding among cultures." When the government promotes antisemitism this is a clear and undeniable violation of Jewish civil rights. In our legal system individuals have the right to be anti-Semites, but the government does not. Where is the redress for this violation of Jewish civil rights?
