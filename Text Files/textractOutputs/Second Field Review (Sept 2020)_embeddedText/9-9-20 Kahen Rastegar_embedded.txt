From: JASMINE KAHEN RASTEGAR Sent: Wednesday, September 9, 2020 12:48 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] AB331
Dear CDE:
It has come to the attention of a group of BHUSD parents that Ab331 as it stands today maintains anti Semitic teachings that directly affect and breach our rights and liberties as granted to us my the US constitution.
This new curriculum although is supposed to teach history of racism and encourage equality for all; rather sneaks in hate against Israel and its people. We obviously contend that this is repulsive at every decent level and will not stay quiet about it.
Please be informed that we, the Beverly Hills Unified School District parents collectively and individually will sue for damages and reparations if such curriculum ends up in our schools and classes. Please be on notice that implementing this Anti Semitic curriculum in our schools is
tantamount to group libel as well as within ambit of the law in Beauharnais v. Illinois.
I thank you for your immediate and kind attention to this very urgent and time sensitive matter.
Respectfully,
Jasmine Kahen Rastegar, JD
