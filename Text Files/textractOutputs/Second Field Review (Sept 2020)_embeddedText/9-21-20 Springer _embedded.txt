Hello,
Our call for balanced curriculum has nothing to do with the politics of Israel or other foreign countries.
It is about achieving diversity, equity and inclusion for all Americans, regardless of race,religion, gender identity, or country of origin.
Please don't ignore the horrible reality of anti-semitism or hatred of any group.
Thank you!
