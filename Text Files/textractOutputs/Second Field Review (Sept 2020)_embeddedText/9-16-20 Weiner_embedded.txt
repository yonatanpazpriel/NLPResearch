Hello, As rabbi of a large CA institution, and past president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis, I would like to add my voice to the disappointment over the recently approved ethnic studies curriculum. In particular, we believe it is essential to include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism, and to exclude denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement. Thank you
