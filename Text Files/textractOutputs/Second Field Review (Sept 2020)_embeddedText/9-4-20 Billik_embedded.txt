Hello,
My name is Sharoni Billik. I urge you to revise the ethnic studies curriculum to:
Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism in all its forms.
Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA.
Remove guiding values and principles which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
Thank you, Sharoni
