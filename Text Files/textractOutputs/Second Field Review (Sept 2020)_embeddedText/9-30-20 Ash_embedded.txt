From: Paul Ash Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 6:46 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns
Dear CDE,
As the former Superintendent of Schools in Lexington Massachusetts, I strongly urge you to keep antisemitism and BDS out of school curriculum. I am very concerned that you are consulting with organizations that openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. In addition I have heard that you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with anti Jewish groups that want the old version, which is unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools.
