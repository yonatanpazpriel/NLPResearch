From: Heidi Straus Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 1:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Respectfully, For Your Consideration, RE: Additions to California Ethnic Studies Model Cirriculum
To the Body This May Concern,
As you are designing the California State Ethnic Studies Curriculum, best practices and the highest level of inclusion would most certainly be your goal. In fact, your curriculum could likely become a model for other states. In that vein, may I propose, below, the addition of some points outstanding. Their inclusion to the model curriculum would make the framework have greater balance.
UTILIZE an accurate definition of antisemitism INCLUDE lessons about antisemitism INCLUDE lessons on Jewish Americans that recognizes diversity of the community, including Ashkenazi , Sephardi and Mizrachi Jews as well as Jews color. (Many Jews come from Ethiopia, India, etc. INCLUDE within your section on Arab Americans lessons on the many Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern descent and Jews of North African descent.
Now THIS inclusion added to what I have seen, would give your gorgeous State of California a rounded Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Lastly, offer full transparency within your ability and the opportunity for public comment. Thank you for your dedication to education!
