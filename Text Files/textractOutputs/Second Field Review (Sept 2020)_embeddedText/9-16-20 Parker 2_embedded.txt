Subject: [EXTERNAL] Fw: 3 Synagogue Arsons in 1 Month in the Most Progressive US Cities - Frontpagemag
The most hurtful example of Jew hatred that I have personally experienced was shortly after the shout-down of Mayor Barkat dour years ago. This event was reported in the J, but nothing about it appeared in any other local new outlet. I was parking my car on Irving street when I saw a Seven On Your Side van parked nearby. There was a man and a woman sitting in the front seat. I asked the man why there had been no coverage of this major event, and he laughed at me and told me in a nasty tone of voice that it was reported on in the Jewish Press, and that I should be satisfied with that. When I go home I made a telephone call to the station and spoke to a young woman who was very sympathetic, but in the background was the sound of laughter which grew louder and louder until the young woman asked if she could call me back. She never did. That the news media in not interested in covering acts of antisemitism is not news. I have emailed the members of the California Jewish Caucus about including the curriculum that Jimena has created into the Ethnic Studies Curriculum that Newsom signed into law. I believe that until the 3,000 year history of the Jewish people in the Middle East is taught in Ethnic Studies you will see the continued rise of Antisemitism in America. I ask you to contact them too. Guardrails will never keep antisemitic teachers from teaching Antisemitism. Only the facts of our history can counteract their teaching.
