Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic Studies: The national response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students including Arab American students - need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in the K-12 curriculum to learn expansively, build empathy, unity, and solidarity with other Americans. No one should be left out. Arab Studies must be included because it is only fair for Arab Americans to be able to strengthen our sense of self, justice, and shore up our selfesteem. We need more discussion and not less to forge stronger bridges between people. Please keep Arab Studies for colleges and Universities, and for K-12. Best Regards Sarab Aziz
