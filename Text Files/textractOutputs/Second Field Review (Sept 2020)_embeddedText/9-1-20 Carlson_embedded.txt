From: Dudley B. Carlson Sent: Tuesday, September 1, 2020 8:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New ethnic studies curriculum
I am horrified at the prospect of an ethnic studies curriculum that suggests "racial privilege" as an attribute of Jewish culture. Jews worldwide have been persecuted, vilified, and excluded to just as great an extent as any other group (Native Americans, Latinx, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, LGBTQ), and for far longer. I am not Jewish, but I would not allow my children - nor want anyone else's - to receive any such distorted propaganda in the guise of "education."
I urge you to consider the value of "ethnic studies" within the context of the current divisions in United States culture. It is absolutely true that we need to educate children about the roles all ethnic groups have played in building this country and the serious ways that they have been discriminated against. But to pretend that there was never discrimination against Italian, Irish, Jewish, Chinese, Japanese or others distorts reality and leads our children toward further prejudice. This must stop.
Thank you for your consideration.
