As a Jewish woman, it pains me to know that hundreds of thousands of young impressionable minds throughout the state will be taught hatred of any kind! We MUST do what we can to stop this and any other law to be put in place that teaches ANY KIND of hate whether it's directed to a race, color, ethnicity, or any religious group.
California has been a pioneer in legislation through the years. We must STOP this law as it sets a precedence for other states to follow! The government CANNOT establish laws that are rooted in anti-Semitism!!! We cannot allow them to brainwash the next generation of young minds against anyone. Has history not taught us anything?!? It begins small and then turns into a snowball. A snowball of hatred begins with just a snowflake. *"We must NEVER forget"*
Thank you,
