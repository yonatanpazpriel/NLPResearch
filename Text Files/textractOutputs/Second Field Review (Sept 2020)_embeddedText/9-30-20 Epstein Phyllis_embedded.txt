In my state at this time in the country's evolution, their is not an inclusion of Jewish Americans, with a proper definition of anti semitism as a form of bigotry in California's Ethnic Studies?. This is most unforgivable. Please reconsider, and include a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community. We come from all different countries, including Western and Eastern Europe, and the Middle East, and often look like the people of those areas-- we are not all white. This must be included to give the true story of the American Jew. Thank you, Phyllis Epstein
