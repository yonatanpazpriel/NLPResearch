The YOK Center and its supporters are petitioning the California Department of Education to include Korean American studies in the ethnic research model curriculum for K-12 education.
Korean Americans have made numerous achievements in the history of California and the United States and have contributed to the United States, which is an integral part.
Since the establishment of the first Korean settlement in Riverside, California in 1905, Korean society has long been a part of American history.
Excluding the voices and identities of Koreans from the ethnological discourse is a mistake that alienates them.
Thank you
Young Kim
