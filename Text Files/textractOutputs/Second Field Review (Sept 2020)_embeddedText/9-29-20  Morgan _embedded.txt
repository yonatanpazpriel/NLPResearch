From: Randall Morgan Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 12:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] AB-331
My name is Randy Morgan, or Howard Randall Morgan Jr. I live in Maryland, but over the past 3 decades, I have employed hundreds of California residents, many of whom are in the Muslim communities of the San Diego and the Bay areas.
With respect to your development of an Ethnic Studies curriculum as proposed in California bill AB-331, I urge you to understand the power and consequences of your decisions by
1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more
accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative. 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of
discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS. 4. Eliminate comparisons of ethnicities, such as comparing American Jews to Irish Americans. 5. Eliminate categorization of specific ethnicities as privileged. Such labeling is subjective and would likely foment harmful ethnic division.
Thank you. Randy
