To Whom It May Concern,
1.
I write to you as an educator, a parent and a Jew regarding the state's new mandate and curriculum regarding Ethnic Studies courses in our schools. I strongly urge you to include the following in the model curriculum and adoption process:
1. 1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community, including Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrachi, Middle Eastern, and Jews of color.
2. Lessons on the history of the Holocaust and other genocides such as the Armenian Genocide and Rwandan Genocide and the impact those events had on the world and continue to have to this day.
3. The inclusion of an accurate definition of antisemitism such as the US State Department's adopted definition
4. The inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. There are many resources out there from the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, and others.
5. Transparency and opportunity for public comment in all phases of development of a final ESMC.
With rising antisemitism across our country and the continued status of Jews as the victims of more hate crimes than any other religion, these actions are paramount to recognizing the vision of California's new mandate.
Sincerely,
Vivian Linderman
