From: Judith Davidson Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Model ethnic curriculum
As a former 7th grade social studies teacher (now retired) I want you to know that I would be unable to teach this curriculum. Parsing the races into privileged slots to fill the requirements of a "theory" is dangerous and unproductive if our goal is to make good, open minded citizens of a diverse society. That is our goal, isn't it? As a taxpayer I object to paying for these curricula that single out any groups for designation as privileged.
