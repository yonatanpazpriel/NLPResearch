Greetings,
Chaim Marcus here from Los Angeles.
I was recently made aware of this new curriculum draft and frankly I'm deeply disturbed to even have to be writing this email.
For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the targeted hatred we experience.
I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by:
-Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment
-Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative
-Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS.
Thank you.
Chaim Marcus
