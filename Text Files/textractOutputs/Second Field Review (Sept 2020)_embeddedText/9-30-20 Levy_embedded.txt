To Whom it may concern:
This Ethnic study required course should include Jewish Americans. Recognize the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans og Middle Eastern and North Africn MENA descent.
