From: Rachelle Cohen Sent: Saturday, September 19, 2020 2:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Revised Curriculum
Dear Board: I have read through the revised curriculum and appreciate that changes were made to remove BDM, which was presented in a very one-sided way and involves a non-U.S. dispute. I understand that the Board is considering adding new model curricula in addition to those currently provided for public comment. I respectfully request that any further changes to this curriculum go through this 3-day review process so that all Californians can comment and that this curriculum is developed with transparency.
Thank you.
-Rachelle Cohen
