1. Hi, I would like to submit my input that the ESMC contain a rich and diverse selection of material covering many ethnicities. Jewish Americans seem to meet most, probably all, typical requirements for a minority and should be included in the material.
2.
3. From a personal perspective, I would prefer the ESMC does not include inflammatory material, especially at high school material, and focus on positive aspects. Political agendas have no place within education, especially when subjective arguments could divert from the learning experience.
4.
5. Also, I do not understand why the material does not include mention of the Holocaust, which would be beneficial from a lessons-learned topic, applicable to past ( Holocaust), current (anti-Semitism) and preventative of future events (all ethnicities).
6.
7. I have seen the following material also included for consideration 8.
1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
2. An inclusion of an accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
Most important is the statement, "Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC". Otherwise, I can envision significant parent consternation about
inappropriate and divisive material.
Thanks, wr, jeff gross
