From: R Sokoler Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Fwd: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Department:
I am writing to ensure that the ESMC does not contain an anti-semitic or BDS related content. There must not be bias or discrimination against the Jewish community or Israel in this curriculum.
The CDE must take action to further improve the ESMC by removing references to biased anti-Israel content, as well as immediately issuing a policy guidance memo to all district school boards regarding national origin discrimination.
District school boards must acknowledge the responsibility and power invested in them by refraining from voting to support or implement supplemental curriculum that includes BDS or any other harmful or anti-semitic rhetoric that is new or was removed from the previous draft. Thorough research must be completed before any proposed content is added.
Social movements taught about in ethnic studies courses should aim to improve the lives of minorities in America. The BDS movement unfairly targets and harms minority groups.
The public demands full transparency. The entire content of the ESMC must be disclosed. We have the right to view the entire curriculum.
Sincerely,
R.W.Sokoler
