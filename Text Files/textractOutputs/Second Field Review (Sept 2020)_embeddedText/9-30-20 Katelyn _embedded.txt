Good afternoon,
I am writing today as a concerned citizen and in reference to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I am an advocate of having such a curriculum in our schools, but think that the current proposal does a disservice to the Jewish community both in California, and around the world.
As a voting Californian, I am calling for:
1. The inclusion of an accurate definition of antisemitism in the curriculum. As we are seeing across the country and world, antisemitism is on the rise. Any curriculum that does not directly discuss the topic runs the risk of perpetuating violence on a minority group in this country. As evidenced by the President's own openness to antisemitism and antisemitic groups in last night's Presidential Debate, it is more imperative than ever to fully and clearly address antisemitism in our country.
2. The inclusion of a lesson plan specifically on Jewish Americans. The Jewish American community is extremely diverse, and includes Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. What's more, there are many Jewish Americans of North Eastern and North African descent, and so any lesson that you plan on teaching about Arab Americans should include the mention of Arab American Jewry.
3. A transparent process in the development of the ESMC and an opportunity for public comment at all phases of the development of the program. In order for the curriculum to be as strong as it can be, the public needs to be able to voice opinions and concerns. Without such, the curriculum runs the risk of continuing the lopsided historical education that is already prevalent in our schools.
Thank you for your time and consideration of these requests.
Sincerely,
Chelsea Lenowska
