Superintendent Tony Thurmond: Japanese Americans have played a major role in California for over 100 years and that includes the infamous WWII incarceration of 120,000 people of Japanese descent. Ethnic Studies model curriculum must include this history especially in California! How can California's economy, agriculture, education, civil rights, and politics be covered without inclusion of Japanese American history? Respectfully, Betty Kano
