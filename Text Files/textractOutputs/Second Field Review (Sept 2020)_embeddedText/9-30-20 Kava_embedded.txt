Hello,
My name is Leora Kava, and I am a professor of Critical Pacific Islands & Oceania Studies at San Francisco State University.
I am writing to amplify the asks of Pacific Islander and Arab American communities in calling for the following actions moving forward with the ESMC and its process. I deeply urge the commission to:
� Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, honoring and including the expertise of the original committee of writers AND Pacific Island Studies experts
� Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism--and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
� Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hauofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam
I am particularly concerned that, alongside a more transparent process for including and consulting with Pacific Islander Studies educators in the process, the ESMC include Arab American Studies content inclusive of Palestine. As an educator in PI Studies, I know first-hand how learning our own histories of Oceania cannot be done in isolation from histories of struggle and solidarity. In fact, Pacific Islander Studies would not be what it is today--in its critical attention to power--without the contributions and histories of Arab American Studies. Without contributions from Arab American Studies, we lose out on vital histories and ways of knowing that can lead our students toward understanding their own contributions to a more just and liberated future.
Thank you for your work and thoughtfulness on this matter,
