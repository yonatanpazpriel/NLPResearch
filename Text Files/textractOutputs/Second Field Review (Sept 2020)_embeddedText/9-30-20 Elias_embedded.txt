From: Aliza Craimer Elias Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Sample Lesson
Dear Instructional Quality Commission Members,
Please find attached ICS's sample lesson on Jewish Americans, titled: "Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race." Jews are a distinct ethnic group connected by rich traditions, thousands of years of history, ancestry, language, and religion. This sense of connection and peoplehood bonds Jews of diverse racial backgrounds and across geographies. We request the model curriculum include Jews with a sample lesson. We appreciate the lesson on Jewish Middle Eastern Americans that has been submitted, and offer this as another option for consideration, which is reflects the rich diversity of the Jewish Americans. This lesson follows the sample lesson template in Chapter 3.
Sincerely,
Aliza Elias
