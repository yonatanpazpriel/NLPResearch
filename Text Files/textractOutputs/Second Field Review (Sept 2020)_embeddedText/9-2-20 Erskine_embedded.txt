From: Amanda Erskine Sent: Wednesday, September 2, 2020 1:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Keep political agendas out
To whom it may concern,
I'm extremely disappointed to hear that you are trying to sneak in political agendas such as BLM and police brutality into my children's education. It has no right to be forced on our children and I strongly oppose the addition to the curriculum.
