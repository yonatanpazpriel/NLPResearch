Good evening,
I am I doin sure whether or not this will actually be read, but I'm praying that you do. My husband is a police officer and puts his life on the line everyday he puts on his uniform. Why would you even consider putting this into the teaching curriculum? BLM represents no family and does NOT value any officers. Should we teach that? How about the government doesn't tell us what to think! Teachers should teach and not give their political views or be forced to teach this nonsense. I'm so incredibly disappointed as a parent, wife and American that you think this is ok. Stephanie Hofacre
