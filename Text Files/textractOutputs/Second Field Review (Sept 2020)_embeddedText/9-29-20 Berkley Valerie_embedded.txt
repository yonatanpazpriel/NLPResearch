From: Valerie Berkley Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] "Jewish privilege"
To whom it may concern, My name is Valerie Berkley and I am a concerned California resident. I was made aware of your proposed new curriculum regarding the ethics studies course. The proposed potential unit that will require students to write about events that have lead to "Jewish Privilege" in America is extremely problematic.
Not only have Jewish people been persecuted their entire history, but anti-semitism is at an all time high in the United States. It is rather ignorant to suggest that the Jewish people benefit from privilege or special treatment in this country or abroad.
I strongly recommend doing your due diligence on the matter before spreading misinformation to our children. I implore you to reevaluate your stance on this subject and eradicate this divisively ignorant language and curriculum.
Thank you very much for your consideration and I hope to see some positive changes in our youths education.
Sincerely, Valerie Berkley
