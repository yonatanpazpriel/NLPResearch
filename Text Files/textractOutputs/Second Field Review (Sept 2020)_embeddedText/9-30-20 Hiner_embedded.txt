I think I may have failed in clarity: Ashkenazis are Jews from Europe. Not all Jews are from Europe/European in origin. This is a big deal.

I write to remind you that ethical inclusion does not extend to blindly and uncritically copy/pasting prejudices from one place to another.
Specifically: The false idea that all Jews, and especially Israelis, are Ashkenazi. The false idea that idea that Ashkenazis have no middle-eastern background and heritage-- and are purely European colonizers, not returnees or relatives. The false idea that there has been and is no historical or modern systemic discrimination against Jews in the Arab world or in the application of International Law.
When I was a teen (in the Netherlands) my first Arab friend (fresh from Saudi), when I told her I was Jewish, screamed in horror and ran away. She did not look at or talk to me for two weeks. As an adult in San Diego it is much the same-- minus the screaming.
Interethnic conflict is complicated and sad and overwhelming. I am only able to have the Arab friends I've had because of the efforts of people like you that paved the way, and provided the supportive structure that role modeled what non-antiSemitism looked like, and rejected implicit and explicit notions of Magic Satan Jews.
Since I moved to Calfornia in late 2016, anti-Semitism has effected my employment, job search, and impacts my life weekly. Anti-Jewish harassment under the anti-Zionism banner has prevented my right to participation in the political process this year. I never dealt with this when I lived in New York or the Netherlands. My toddler daughter does not deserve what I am living through, and I hope this isn't the future you will write for her as a student.
As such, please include a Jewish portion in the ethnic studies curriculum following the ADL suggestions, including:
� Recognizing Jewish ethnic diversity: not just Ashkenazis, but also Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Please do not exclude Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) from an Arab chapter. Arab Jews are not less Arab for being Jewish.
� An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
� Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism, a foundational 'othering' in western culture that provides a template for most others

� Transparency & public comment opportunity in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
Thank You, Rebecca Hiner
