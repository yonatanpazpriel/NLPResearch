From: Stuart Creque Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 1:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns
Dear CDE, The draft Ethnic Studies Curriculum will enshrine bigotry against Jews in California's educational system. It needs to be amended substantially to expunge this injustice. Jews have the dubious honor of being non-white to White Supremacists and being white to so-called "antiracists." The ESMC should make this contradiction clear to California's students so they can understand why and how Jews are targets of hatred from both extremes of the political spectrum. The concept of Jews as a "privileged ethnicity" is not only inaccurate and insulting, but dangerous and deadly.
� Problematic Citations o Many of the citations in this curriculum are from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel authors. o Raises concerns on what teachers will find when they use the sources for supplemental content
� American Jews Chapter o compares American Jews to Irish Americans o teaches how Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnicity. o terrifying as a Jew due to the rise in antisemitism during the last year because Jewish Americans are compared to white supremacists and blames Jews for racial injustice in America. o Jews have never stopped being discriminated against, hated, and of course, the target of several violent and deathly attacks. o For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the targeted hatred we experience.
Best regards,
