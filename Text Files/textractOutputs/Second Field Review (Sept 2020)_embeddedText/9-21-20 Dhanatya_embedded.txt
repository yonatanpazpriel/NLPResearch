From: Cathryn Dhanatya Sent: Monday, September 21, 2020 9:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Exclusion of multiple API communities in the proposed CDE Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Mr. Thurmond,
First, I am happy that the CDE is considering the inclusion of a more diverse ethnic studies curriculum for K-12 students. After review of the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, it seems that there are numerous Asian and Pacific Islanders that have been excluded in the material. The API community is extremely diverse and in order to understand and scope and breath a more diverse representation of the various experiences should be included. The Japanese American, Korean American, Vietnamese American, South Asian communities are not barely mentioned and have large and important populations within California. I hope that the CDE will reconsider the exclusion of these important voices in the new curriculum.
Best,
