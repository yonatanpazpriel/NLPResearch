From: Lauren Sukin Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 10:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Antisemitism in Ethic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
The current draft of the curriculum for ethnic studies perpetuates antisemitism.
The following goal is particularly problematic: "[Students] will be asked to think critically about why and who is allowing this evolution [of Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege] in white identity and how this shift is affecting the identity of Irish and Jewish Americans."
The curriculum should recognize the continuing antisemitic attitudes and violence in the United States and around the world, and it should question assumptions about the influence of Jewish Americans. The curriculum should be developed with input from Jewish organizations and leaders.
As it stands, the curriculum is unacceptable and must be changed.
Sincerely,
Lauren Sukin Ph.D. Candidate, Department of Political Science, Stanford University Brown University '16, Political Science & Literary Arts
