It is exceptionally important that the textbooks you propose to put out be devoid of any anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. You must remember who your audience is: children. What you propose to include in the upcoming versions of the curriculum will impact the lives of the readers, our children, in a very negative way. I can say that as an educator at the elementary, middle school , and university level for over 36 years. I am also a writer of a textbook. I know the same version was used throughout the country. I am aware that textbooks in the past developed under the auspices of the Catholic Church for use in parochial demeaned Jews. That was corrected over time, but those early versions of the text impacted the children not only in their youth but into their later years. I ask you to review all components of the ESMC curriculum of 7/2020, making certain that there are no elements of antiSemitism and anti-Israel content.
