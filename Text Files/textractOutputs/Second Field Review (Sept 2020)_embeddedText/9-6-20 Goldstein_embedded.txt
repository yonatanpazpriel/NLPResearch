The ethnic-studies movement, known as `critical ethnic studies,' which is what this curriculum is a product of, is based on an `us vs them' model. It views Jews as white and privileged, and not part of the `us,' and is blatantly anti-Zionist. After 6 million Jews perished in concentration camps just 75 years ago, it defies logic that they are now classified as elite and white privileged. Also Jews struggled incredibly to become somewhat integrated into American society, but still suffer more and more anti-semitism in the present. Anti-Semitic attacks are at an all time high in America. I believe that your using Jews as an example of white elite privilege is blatant AntiSemitism.
How can Jews serve as an example of elite white privilege? There are constant images of rap singers, speakers, and articles, etc which portray Jews as evil and scheming. There are constant vile anti-Semitic comments by Louis Farrakhan, Linda Sarsour, and many others Please alter this section of the curriculum or leave it out. Jews should not be represented in the ethnic studies curriculum as Elite White Privileged people. I believe that your using Jews as an example of white elite privilege is blatant AntiSemitism.
Thanks for reading this, and I hope you will reconsider this terminology and this section of the curriculum
