To whom it may concern,
The draft ethnic studies model curriculum isn't good enough yet. It doesn't accurately represent Jews as an ethnicity. Judaism is a religion, but Jews are also an ethnically-diverse ethnicity and should be included, even though that is confusing. Life is confusing. We need a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that represtns the diversity of the community. Jews of Middle Eastern and North African descent should be represented in the lesson on Arab Americans AND on Jewish Americans. (Like I said, before, it's confusing because life is.). There also needs to be education about anti-semitism, including how it is and isn't like racism. And of course there needs to be public input and transparency about development of the model curriculum.
All the best
