As an author of children's historical nonfiction, specializing in "forgotten voices," I do a lot of school visits and am keenly aware of how poorly history is taught in California, how much more inclusive it needs to be. This new decision to EXCLUDE a minority that continues to be targeted is especially horrific. It breaks my heart that on Rosh Hashana, Jews are marginalized now more than ever,by the decision to not include Jews and the Holocaust as part of Ethnic Studies in the California curriculum. This despite the rise in anti-Semitic crimes, despite the ugly language of white supremacism that "Jews will not replace us," despite the appalling general level of ignorance students already have about the Holocaust. We need more education, not less! Marissa Moss
