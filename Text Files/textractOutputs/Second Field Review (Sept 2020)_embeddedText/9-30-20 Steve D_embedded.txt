Dear members of the IQC and SBE,
The "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, Second Field Review Draft" in its entirety, is a terrible idea that will harm California's children and culture generally for many years to come if implemented.
This program spends precious education time teaching our kids to focus on their DIFFERENCES when we should focus on what unites us. Throughout human history every race, religion, culture and sect of humanity has been attacked and oppressed at one time or another. But our United States have strived like no other nation before to insure equal treatment and protection of all people.
Ethnic studies programs have been taught here in the U.S. since the 60's and there is no evidence that they have improved race relations, which proponents claim to be the primary objective. Quite the contrary! Today we have groups of young people using the very concepts taught in ethnic studies programs to demand contrition and even submission from random strangers who are perceived to be "privileged" because of their race!
The more California schools have strayed from classical educational principles which we have for decades, our student performance has declined while the cost of public education has ballooned. Assigning a mandatory ethnic studies program on every child is a bad idea that will damage our kids, our state and its educational future. Please do not implement this radical, experimental program on California's public schools.
