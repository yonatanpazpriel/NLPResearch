To Tony Thurmond:
I strongly implore you to amend the current k-12 ethnic studies curriculum to include the history and information about Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Korean Americans, and all other Asian minorities. Much of California's history includes Asian Americans and it is only right that future generations understand the treatment of our diaspora and the impact our ancestors had on our state. Erasing the history and different cultures is not only an injustice but it is a willfully ignorant decision to make during a time where understanding and diversity is needed in order to educate children so they do not make the same uneducated mistakes that many adults make today.
Thank you, Isabella Asali
