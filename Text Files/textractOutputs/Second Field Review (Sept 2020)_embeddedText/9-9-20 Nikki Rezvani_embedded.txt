SHAME ON YOU FOR WANTING TO PASS INTO LAW CURRICULUM THAT PERPETUATES HATE AND ANTISEMITIC TEACHINGS. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU FOR PASSING SUCH A BILL. THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES IN BEVERLY HILLS AND BHUSD WILL RIOT AND PROTEST AND BRING SO MANY LAW SUITES IF YOU DECIDE TO BRING THIS ANTIISRAEL ANTI-JEWISH GARBAGE INTO OUR DISTRICT!!!!!
