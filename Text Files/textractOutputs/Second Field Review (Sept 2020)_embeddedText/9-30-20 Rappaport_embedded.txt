I write you as an American Jew who wishes to see a two-state solution in Israel without terrorism. I also write you as part of the Jewish San Diego community wanting to keep anti-semitic events down to 0 in my community and through-out California.
I support AB 331 which mandates CA High school students complete the Ethnic Studies Course to graduate. I support the lesson plans including African, Asian, Native and Latinx Americans. I know that what teenagers learn in high school tends to stay in their mind-set as they become adults.
Put this all together and the question becomes: Why not include Jewish Americans as your 5th group? I also am not offended by any insertion re: Arab Americans, who I have worked with and respect. But why include anything anti-semitic or anti-Israel in with this material?
Do not fan the flames of hatred. Unnecessary and irresponsible. I thought this was settled before the Coronavirus Pandemic and am alarmed that it was not.
Thank you, Jill Rappaport
