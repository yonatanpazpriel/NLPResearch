Hi, my name is Rebecca Rosenheim, and I live in Los Gatos, California.
I'm writing because I'm concerned about the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum and the impact it will have (in its current form) on Jewish and Israeli Americans, who have already been experiencing an increase in anti-semitic incidents and hate crimes.
Today's Ethnic Studies Curriculum has a chapter, in which American Jews are referred to as a "privileged ethnicity," whose inclusion will likely encourage the ever-increasing practice of blaming Jews for racial injustice and comparing them to white supremacists. Additionally, the Curriculum includes citations (that teachers will naturally look to for supplementary content) from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel authors.
My main concern is that this curriculum, whose goal is to educate about minorities and their struggles, will, in its current form, do just the opposite, by contributing to misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and fueling the targeted hatred Jews are already experiencing.
Please 1) rewrite the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative, 2) remove all citations with anti-Israel sentiment and 3) ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to references to BDS.
Thank you very much!
