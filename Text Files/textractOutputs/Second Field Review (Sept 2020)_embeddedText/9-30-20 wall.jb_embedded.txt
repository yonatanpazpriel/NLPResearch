The course outline below should be deleted as its section, Unit 6 Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American states:
We will examine the differences between the reception of Jewish and Irish immigrants to what it means to be Jewish and Irish now in the twenty first century. We will discuss parallels between language used to describeIrish and Jewish immigrants to those used in the early years of the UnitedStates to describe Native Americans. Students will investigate labor disputes and how they were ended and how that relates to the redefining of white. Posing questions on who gets to decide those that get to join the 'club' and why. Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege. They will be asked to think critically about why and who is allowing this evolutionin white identity and how this shift is affecting the identity of Irish and Jewish Americans.
This feeds in to anti-Semitism which is becoming more prevalent in our country.
