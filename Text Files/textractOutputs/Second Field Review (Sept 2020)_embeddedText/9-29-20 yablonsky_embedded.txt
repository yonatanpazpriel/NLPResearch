To Whom it May Concern,
I reviewed the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and am thrilled that California will be implementing this program.
I heard about this through my synagogue and wanted to read through the curriculum due to potential anti-semetic content. I did not find anti-semitism in the lesson plan, but am concerned that anti-semitism is not within the curriculum unless directed by an individual teacher.
I don't know if it fits, but I would love to find a place to teach about Jewish Americans and anti-semitism. In San Diego / La Jolla, it wasn't that long ago that Jews could not purchase property. Jews have been very successful in America, but Anti-semitisim is still quite common. It seems to me that most people (definitely not all) who are not affected by it are blind or deaf to it.
I am sure this will be an amazing course. I applaud the effort. Please ensure that, at a minimum, anti-Semitic content is not included in the final cut.
Thank you! Mike Yablonsky 1.
