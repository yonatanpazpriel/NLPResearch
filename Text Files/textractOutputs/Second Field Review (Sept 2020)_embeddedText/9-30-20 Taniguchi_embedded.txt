Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At a minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
I hijacked my 4th Grade history lesson when I found ONE SENTENCE that spoke about the incarceration of the Japanese and Japanese Americans in 1942 in my history book in 1968. Had an argument with a black girl in my class, saying that *I* had caused WWII! I clapped back even then, saying that I wasn't even born yet! 
We ended up spending the hour discussing what that one sentence meant to thousands of Japanese in America...based on fear, racism and rhetoric. And what price freedom could cost people caught in the crossfire, who had nothing to do with a fight they weren't involved in.
If I could do it then in 1968, I can certainly do this now! One sentence in an old history book doesn't even BEGIN to explain the depth and scope of generational pain, trauma and suffering my family and thousands of other families went through...and are still struggling with now.

My father joined the 442nd Infantry Regimental Batallion of the US Army along with thousands of other second-generation Japanese-Americans to prove that they were American even though the country didn't recognize them. He fought a war of righteousness and principle...as am I with this letter today.
Eternal gratitude and thanks to my 4th Grade teacher, Mrs. Gaitor, for allowing me to speak my truth that day. Please DO NOT deny our children the education of history that they deserve to know by limiting the curriculum to sanitized standards of the truth.
The Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely,
