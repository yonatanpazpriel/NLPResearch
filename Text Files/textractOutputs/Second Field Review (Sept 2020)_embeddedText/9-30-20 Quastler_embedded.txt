From: Karen Q Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns
Dear CDE,
Please take action to further improve the ESMC by removing references to biased anti-Israel content. You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools.
The BDS movement harms minority groups in America and does advocacy related to a foreign conflict that should fall outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses. Referencing this hateful movement would contradict the goals of the ESMC, as BDS promotes hate and discrimination based on national origin.
Thank you for reconsidering and doing the right thing for all Californians.
Sincerely, Karen Quastler
