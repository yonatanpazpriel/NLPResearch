Dear State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, President Linda Darling-Hammond and members of the State Board of Education, and members and staff of the Instruction Quality Commission at the California Department of Education,
I am attaching a petition of 3,352 signatures in support of Pacific Islander Studies in California as of September 30, 2020. The most recent draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum includes an edited version of the Pacific Islander curriculum and excludes Arab American Studies. We as the undersigned, ask the IQC to:
�
� Reconvene
� the original advisory committee in the ESMC process moving forward � � � Include � a Pacific Islander Studies lesson plan that covers the complexity and diversity of the Pacific
alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hau'ofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question � of Guam � � � Communicate � with the Pacific Islander community, ensuring that the final PI curriculum is vetted and approved by Pacific Studies educators � � � Work
� with Arab American educators and community on the development of Arab American studies curriculum, with content inclusive of Palestine
�
