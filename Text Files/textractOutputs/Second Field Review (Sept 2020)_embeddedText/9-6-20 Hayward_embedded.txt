While pleased that there have been improvements in the Model Curriculum, I am very disappointed with and worried about the end result.
It seems to focus only on Jews of recent European ancestry. The reality is that there are black Jews from Africa and brown Jews from the Middle East. In fact, non-European Jews are the majority in Israel.
JIMENA (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa) has created a lesson plan that is far more inclusive and educational than the current curriculum. I urge you to adopt it.
Your proposed curriculum lends itself to double standards about Zionism and to false narratives about the Palestinian experience.
Basically, I am concerned that, in the age of rising anti-Semitism, the curriculum will feed that hatred and bias. That is not what our classrooms are for.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, Fred Hayward
