From: Ilene Sokoloff Sent: Friday, September 18, 2020 12:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; [emails redacted] Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove One-Sided Political Agenda from ESMC and Stop Indoctrination
Dear To Whom It May Concern, I support the requests of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies which you recently received to remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles" and resulting lessons by: 1. Removing the inflammatory "Guiding Values and Principles" which can bring hate and
political dogma into the classroom. 2. Aligning all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes. 3. Adding Elements of a Balanced Curriculum for safeguards against politicizing Ethnic
Studies. 4. Excluding BDS and other one-sided political conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts. 5. Including approaches to social change that work within the system to improve it. 6. *Adopt the State Departments definition of Antisemitism. Sincerely, Ilene Sokoloff, Los Altos Hills, CA 94024
