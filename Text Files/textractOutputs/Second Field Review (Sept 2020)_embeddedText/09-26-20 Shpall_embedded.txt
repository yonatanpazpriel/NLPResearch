> As a native Californian and grandparent of children in California public schools, I think the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should be re-written because it is politically one sided, advocates student resistance, and promotes victimization. Instead, an ethnic studies curriculum should encourage appreciation for other ethnicities, emphasize self-reliance, and show how what may have been originally "marginalized groups" were able to take advantage of the freedom afforded them in the United States and succeed.
