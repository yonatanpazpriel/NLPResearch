From: Yeonji No Sent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 12:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Korean American Studies
Dear California Department of Education,
My name is Yeonji No and I am an adjunct professor at San Jose State University. Even though I was born and raised in South Korea, I have learned about Black heritage, US constitution, Bill of Rights as well as Cesar Chavez and farm worker rights when I started higher education here in the United States. In all of these stories about the ethnic American experience, I learned about tolerance, diversity and how their stories built what America is today.
My daughter is in 3rd grade. For her reading and writing assignments, she learns about Barrack Obama and Harriet Tubman. I thought that was a great idea. She listed other famous activists in history - Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and Jackie Robinson. I questioned a bit why she didn't consider an Asian, specifically a Korean person in history. I decided to personally introduce my daughter to famous Koreans in Korean history. I believe that it is imperative for us to educate children based on the good educational foundation and system for better access and wider outreach. Currently, we are solely relying on individual efforts in this matter.
It's my understanding that Governor Newson is trying to introduce Ethnic studies into the K-12 curriculum. Thank you for your decision toward to making a much diverse and understanding society. Considering that Koreans making up such a large part of the Asian population in California, I strongly believe that Korean American Studies should be included among Asian American Studies section. It would be advantageous to learn about our diverse community, beyond Koreatown and K pop -stories of the Korean immigration experience and it's 3 waves from 1903 until the present; America's influence over the Korean independence movement in 1919; the reasons that impacted Korean immigration to the US and also their impact on the American experience today.
Please consider including the Korean American experience in the K-12 curriculum.
Sincerely,
--Yeonji No, Ph.D.
