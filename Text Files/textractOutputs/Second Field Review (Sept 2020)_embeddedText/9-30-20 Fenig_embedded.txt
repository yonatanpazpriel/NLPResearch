To the honorable Mr Thurmond I am personally frightened as a Jew living in California where students will be asked why and how jewish immigrants ended up becoming a privileged class in America. Really - do we need to create more hate and antisemitism and support the lies propogated in the well know Book `elders of Zion'.
My grandparents came to the east coast as refugees with nothing but the shirt on their backs. They worked very very hard. Did any kind of work to put bread on the table and sent their kids to schools to have a better life. My father knew he had to make good be a good student because of the sacrifice that he knew was behind him every step of the way. Today that hard work is called `privilege', and it's vilified and seen as an unfair advantage. My grandparents went through worse racism than any black persons alive today went through. They were rounded up and gassed - 6 million of them- for being jewish. Only 75 years ago. And al we can teach the kids in school is that Jews are privileged? Will u teach them that the crusades killed tens of thousands of Jews in Europe too? Was that privileged? How about the cosa la who murdered over 30,000 Jews in their programs across russia and Ukraine. We were privileged then too I guess? The Spanish Inquisition who forced conversion or expulsion and death by torture and burning at the stake. That was a high privilege. It's clear that whomever is drafting the content is either ignorant of the history they are writing about or has an insidious hate lines agenda. Do not be complicit !!! Do not approve the curiculum as proposed! I can not stay in this state while a state sanctioned and mandated course of study poisons minds and begets racism and antisemitism!
Sincerely Mickey Fenig Los Angeles California - I hope....
