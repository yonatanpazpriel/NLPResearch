Dear decision maker,
It has come to my attention that BDS organizations are trying to force the California Department of Education to put Antisemitism, BDS, and antizionism back into the curriculum.
This is terribly worrying. The prospect of allowing a curriculum that endorses hateful content is just horrifying to us as parents.
We are aware that this is being done by introducing a new lesson plan chapter that no one is allowed to see until the public commenting period is over.
We demand transparency and that the CDE stand by its pledge of excluding BDS and antisemitism from school lessons!
Please don't allow this in our schools.
