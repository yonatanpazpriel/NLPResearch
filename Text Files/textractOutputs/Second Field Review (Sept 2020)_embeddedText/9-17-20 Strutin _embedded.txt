From: Michal Strutin Sent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 7:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Dear members of the CA Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC):
I applaud the Commission's work to create a California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It is important for students to learn about and value the history and cultures of all its citizens, especially those who have suffered from centuries of discrimination.
That said, I hope the curriculum will emerge as a model of learning and critical thinking and not as a platform for activism or advocacy. The goal of education is to give students the tools--through broad enquiry--to make their own choices.
In addition, I am concerned that previous drafts of the curriculum included anti-Israel and antisemitic themes, and may again. A May 5, 2020, L.A. Times report details that 2019 saw the highest number of antisemitic incidents in more than 40 years, including murders by terrorists. Not only would such themes fuel more antisemitism, prejudice against particular peoples seems antithetical to what you are trying to achieve.
I ask you to accept and pledge to the following FOUR requests related to the ESMC:
1. The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism. 2. No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with
guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future. 3. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans,
including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color. 4. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
Sincerely, Michal Strutin
