Today's world-wide and destructive attacks against various ethnic minorities has proven that violence and discrimination are still viewed as an acceptable political tool. Since the majority of the next generation of Californians will be educated by the public school systems, and since California is home to a widely diverse population, it is critical this opportunity to counter this agenda and to foster appreciation and understanding of these various cultures not be overlooked. The Jewish people have survived thousands of years of violence and discrimination world-wide. We are a richly cultured community, including Askenazi, Sephardi, Mizrachi Jews, and Jews of Color. Now, with the inclusion of antiSemitic content in the newly-reinstated educational unit on Arab history, our state is poised, not to foster understanding through education, but to reinforce and legitimatise this destructive belief.
It is essential that this developing curriculum be amended to include an accurate definition of antisemitism, such as was adopted by the U.S. State Department, and be purged of any hatred-legimitizing content.
"Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."
Please consider the future of all Caifornia children, and help them to foster understanding and acceptance, to make California a place where all can build a good future.
