To Whom It May Concern-
The importance of ethnic education can't be forgotten especially in this time of our country's history. With a country that continues to be divided, it is more important than ever to include ethnic studies and cultural awareness and inclusion. With proper teachers and the amazing curriculum of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, teachers can expose students to various cultures and ethnicities to make them more understanding and unbiased citizens. It is imperative that in a time where we are required to isolate and social distance that we don't separate those further. My understanding of Korea thanks to the wonderful teaching and learning provided by the National Korean Studies that made me a better teacher and my students more aware. Stopping learning is the worst punishment one can give to future generations and deciding what one can learn is against everything our country has worked for, so we must not stop our forward advances.
Thanks, Mandy Perret
