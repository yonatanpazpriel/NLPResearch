Gentle People,
Thank you for making significant improvements to the second draft, including removal of many of the references to the BDS campaign and other overtly biased content targeting Jews and Israel, but there are some serious loopholes remaining.
We must have clear guardrails that protect against anti-Semitic materials that Jews as that would seek to characterize Jewish rights to self-determination as an act of imperialist colonialism or downplay the history of antisemitism in the American experience.
I fully support the inclusion of Arab Americans alongside other Middle Eastern, North African, Armenian and Indian Americans in the Asian American section, as well as the inclusion of Pacific Islanders - we should work out these issues moving forward as it continues to roll out.
But for now, adopting the IHRA guidelines and examples on identifying antisemitism will create guardrails against the introduction of inappropriate materials containing anti-Semitic concepts in our schools while the other issues involving inclusion are worked out.
As a loyal American, as a U.S. Army Veteran and a man of the Jewish faith I urge you to recognize the disturbing rise of anti-semitic activities, both on social media and in the streets. This is not a matter of paranoia...this is documented fact. The Ethnic Studies Program requires care attention to what harm malevolent information can do to our society when introduced to our youth at such a formative time in their lives. America has been better than that and must remain the inclusive and safe democratic nation we cherish.
Thank you for your consideration. Ellis R Diamond, MD
