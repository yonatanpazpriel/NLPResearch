RE: Protect and improve Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
On behalf of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC) and the undersigned organizations of the Coalition Helping to Achieve Racial and Gender Equity (CHARGE), we write with three purposes:
1. To provide comments on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), specifically on the Asian American history section to include a much more comprehensive curriculum of the diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities in California.
2. To advocate for the inclusion of comprehensive sample curriculum for Vietnamese, Laotian, IuMien, and Cambodian American studies; the latter was included in the first draft of the ESMC but is omitted from the current draft without justification.
3. To advocate that the sample lesson on the Historical and Contemporary Experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States remain in the ESMC.
AAPI CHARGE, coordinated by SEARAC, is a statewide youth and community centered movement that works toward building the advocacy capacity of AAPI youth, empowering them to seek equitable policy change and shift narratives on AAPI communities. CHARGE provides AAPI young people a platform to amplify their voices across California. Our coalition focuses on increasing Southeast Asian American and Pacific Islander visibility, including through advocacy of adequate educational support and ethnic studies courses that teach youth about our history and cultural identities and dismantle the `model minority' myth.
We appreciate the California Department of Education's effort to ensure appropriate implementation of AB 2016 (Alejo) by revising the draft of the model curriculum and considering public comments from August 2019. However, we were deeply disappointed that sample curricula critical to the representation of our communities was removed and that many of our public comments were not reflected in the revised draft of the ESMC released this month. We urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and take into consideration the critical feedback provided by communities represented under the four core fields of African American, Asian American, Chicanx and Latinx, and Native American Studies.
We believe that California's ESMC must be robust and reflect the diverse populations that make up California, including the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. Given the potential mandate for ethnic studies to be a requirement for high school graduation across the state, it is with utmost importance that the ESMC reflects a framework and curricula that are representative of all Californians.

We respectfully request that the ESMC include the following revisions: 1. Include curriculum covering the Cambodian, Vietnamese, Lao, Iu-Mien, Japanese, Korean, Lao, South Asian, and Arab American communities. Arab American studies has long been included within AAPI curriculum in higher education. California is home to the largest Asian American population in the United States. As such, it is critical to reflect the history and contributions of diverse subgroups and avoid the mischaracterization of an Asian American monolith. 2. Include curriculum that explores SEAA immigrant and refugee experiences and discusses the discrimination and resiliency these communities have faced as Americans. While Chapter 3 touches on using a "Southeast Asian Studies approach" (line 522), only Hmong curriculum is included while Cambodian, Vietnamese, Lao, and Iu-Mien curricula is excluded. 3. Restore sample lessons from the first draft of the ESMC, including: � Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community � Cambodian Americans � Deportation Breaking Families Apart 4. Ensure integration of the full ESMC. Currently, Chapters 2 and 3 are not integrated with specific sample lessons in Appendix B or instructional resources in Appendix C. The curriculum needs to state how to use the appendices appropriately. 5. There is not a uniform structure of each "lesson" in the curriculum. Some units are developed, while others are less comprehensive and thorough.
Please see attached documents for detailed comments. � Attachment A: SEARAC comments on the ESMC Draft August 2020 � Attachment B: SEARAC comments on the ESMC Draft May 2019, redacted to include our original and new comments for the two sample lessons to be restored (see #3 above) � Attachment C: Sample lesson plan for Vietnamese American studies � Attachment D: Sample lesson plan for Laotian American studies, which is inclusive of the Iu Mien community
We urge the Instructional Quality Commission to protect the ESMC, carefully review the curriculum, and make the appropriate changes and additions we have proposed above and attached. These changes will be crucial to the success of the students from school districts that will turn to the ESMC for guidance. We look forward to continuing this partnership as we seek to ensure that all students in California are able to learn about their own and other's histories toward cultural awareness, self-determination, and community.
Please reach out to our Director of California, Mandy Diec at mandy@searac.org if you have any questions.

Page 31 Line 800: Change "model minority myth" to "model minority" myth, to avoid misunderstanding and reaffirm that these stereotypes are indeed false. Page 32 Line 829: Include the Iu-Mien population alongside Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong, and Laotian history during the Southeast Asian Refugee Crisis. There are significant Iu-Mien communities in Northern California and their support of the United States, such as during the Secret War in Laos should not be overlooked within the experiences of SEAA immigrants. Page 33 Line 858: Include the Southeast Asian Refugee Crisis into lessons on Populations Displaced by War and Genocide, if both lessons are not taught separately. As the largest group of refugees to ever resettle into the United States, due largely to war and genocide, SEAAs must be included in any curricula regarding such displacement. Pages 111-113: Additional Sample Topics include a wide range of pertinent topics, but most of them are not expanded upon in the ESMC. Only Hmong American and Pacific Islander Studies have sample curriculum to help ethnic studies teachers develop and implement courses. Key topics underlying the AAPI experience such as the model minority myth deserve more thought and guidance within the ESMC. General:
� The terms "Asian American" and "Asian American and Pacific Islander" are used inconsistently throughout this section. Under this section, Pacific Islanders should not be assumed to be part of the Asian American identity and the collective AAPI term should be used consistently.
� The current curriculum must be comprehensive of diverse AAPI experiences. There is missing curriculum for various ethnic communities, including Cambodian, Lao, Iu-Mien, and Vietnamese Americans.

Developing a comprehensive AAPI curriculum will allow school districts with varying demographics to have appropriate curriculum from which to reference, utilize, and build on. � Curriculum should be more uniform throughout the lessons; it appears that some lessons are more organized, developed, and thorough than others. Each section and lesson should have specific time allocations appropriate for the scope of the topic(s) to be covered. � More homework, exams, reflection exercises, or other avenues should be implemented to ensure that students are retaining what they are taught. Instead of just learning during class time, students can do background research or analyze texts before getting introduced to it in class the next day � this way, they have sufficient time to process new information. � The sample lesson on the "Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community" from the first ESMC draft should be restored, including the section that explores significant figures and their contributions to Asian Americans. Our comments on this section are also attached from the previous public commenting period. Concepts to include in this lesson may include:
o Racialization o Color/colorism o Third world o Pan-ethnicity o Other including yellow peril/model minority o Inclusion/exclusion (constant part of Asian American history) o Colorblind concept (used to pit two peoples against each other) o Lessons of LA Riots o Orientalism (under ideology) � The sample lesson on the "Cambodian Americans � Deportation Breaking Families Apart" from the first ESMC draft should be restored. Our comments on this section are also attached from the previous public commenting period. � There should be a specific sample lesson on Vietnamese Americans. A draft sample lesson is reflected in Attachment C.

� There should be a specific sample lesson on Laotian Americans that is inclusive of the Iu Mien community. A draft sample lesson is reflected in Attachment D.
� The Southeast Asian American experience may be combined (Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos) into one lesson due to similar narratives regarding the refugee resettlement experience, such as growing up as American, being bi-cultural, serving as a cultural broker, and intergenerational trauma. This lesson can be 4 days, 1 day for each ethnic group, with the Iu-Mien experience woven through. The last day can be reflection on the similarities and differences of SEAAs and the wider AAPI community.
� Lessons on Asian American movements, activism, and Yellow Power should include the following groups that played key roles in California � AAPA, ICSA, PACE, Red Guards, KDP, and Wei Min She/Asian Community Center.
Page 68 Line 1357: Instead of asking students if they "have questions about the Hmong," the teacher should ask "What type of information would be useful in learning more about the Hmong community?" Page 68 Line 1366: Include a trigger-warning prior to watching the video. Following the video, students will need time to process the information. There should be a discussion or reflection that is facilitated by the teacher after students finish processing. Page 69 Line 1380: There should be a transition between the prior video and the new video. This video would make more sense in a model minority myth lesson as a counter argument. The video does not address the gender dynamic and issues that are being focused on in the section. General: We recommend separating the sections into two different lessons: Day 1 - Hmong Immigrant Experience and Hmong Americans, and Day 2 - Compare and Contrast of Genders in the Hmong Community. There is also a lack of homework for students to do; students can conduct research on outstanding questions from the first activity of the lesson. General: Since this lesson is about Social movement, at the end of the lesson, mention more about the importance of social movements, self-determination, mobilization, solidarity, etc. Connect it to the current discussion of protest songs.

Page 87 Line 1730: The key terms and concepts listed in this lesson are not clearly identified, defined, and integrated in this lesson. Rework how the key terms and concepts are woven into the lesson. Take out "assimilate" as a key concept because it is not touched on or discussed. Page 88 Line 1739: The first question does not promote any critical thinking and rather is just regurgitation of information. Replace with a more thought-provoking question such as "Describe how the Chinese immigrants moved and why they responded the way they did to repressive conditions in U.S. history." General: Include homework into the lessons so students can better retain information and conduct further research. General: Include A list of cultural figures that demonstrates the full diversity of the Pacific Islander community across ability, ethnicity, gender, class, citizenship, and sexuality.

Page 162 Line 3337: When explaining the negative effects of the model minority myth, include an explanation on how Asian Americans have systematically been used as a wedge between communities and are pitted against other groups of color. Change the language from "African Americans and other oppressed groups" to "other oppressed groups including but not limited to..." Page 165 Line 3397: Before transitioning from explaining how stereotypes are the result of the model minority myth to showing the article, ask students if they know what the model minority myth is. If someone raises hand, have student answer. Afterwards explain to the class that they'll be examining the effects of the MMM in society. If nobody raises hand, just do the latter part. Page 165 Line 3414: Homework should involve more critical thinking. In addition to developing counter arguments, have students also research case studies or situations in which the model minority myth has impacted Asian Americans (i.e. Vincent Chin case, Southeast Asian youth with low education attainment, etc.) Page 191 Line 3944: Revise "felons" to "Cambodian Americans with felony convictions." The current language of calling community members felons can be dehumanizing and projects the criminalization of immigrants. Page 191 Lines 3945-46: The number of Cambodian American deportees should be updated to say "over 1,000 Cambodian Americans have been deported." It is also important to note that those departed back to Cambodia are sent to a country where they often do not have familial or social connections. Page 192 Line 3970: The number of people that died during the Khmer Rouge should be updated to reflect a range of 10-30% of the population, or 1.2 million

Lesson Purpose and Overview: The lesson focuses on the history, politics, culture, contributions, challenges, and current status of Vietnamese Americans in the United States.
Overview: Vietnamese Americans play an integral part in shaping the America's multicultural and multilingual transformation. To understand this process, we must examine the following:
� Vietnamese Refugees: Vietnamese refugee experience include escapes by boats to neighboring countries from 1975 to 1995. There were estimates of up to two millions of people escaping by boats and approximately half of them perished in the high seas. Many faced hunger, thirst, piracy or other traumatic experiences during their journeys. The international community made great efforts to support these coming waves of refugees, but exhausted around 1995 when it started to stop accepting these refugees and forcing them to return to their homeland. The boat people saga and the hypervisibility of the plight of refugees forced the U.S., and the international community, to negotiate with Vietnam to allow other waves of Vietnamese leaving through other humanitarian programs under the auspices of family reunification that particularly targeted former political prisoners, Amerasian children, and former employees of the U.S. government. Most of the refugees were accepted for resettlement to sanctuary countries all over the world, and many resettled in the U.S. The resettling refugees were first

scattered all over the U.S., but most of them eventually congregated around largest concentrations of Vietnamese communities in Orange County, San Jose, Houston, Virginia or Florida. � New Life in America. Most of Vietnamese refugees arrived in America without any preparation economically, educationally, or culturally. Children were enrolled in schools at their age level with a new language and education system and limited support. Adults were either enrolled in adult schools or began new lives with new job skills or life experiences which were totally different from their normal lives in Vietnam. Many refugees who settled in the U.S. had no proof of certification of their trades or professional careers. They worked in manually laborious jobs that did not require a mastery of the English language. Many Vietnamese children adapted well in American schooling, but their parents or adult relatives were less successful. Overall, they adapted well in their new homeland but the scars of the war, life under community rule, boat escapes, and cultural shocks upon arrival in American continued with many of them in varying degrees. Those scars foster their anti-communist sentiments and strong pride in and gratitude to America which welcomes them as refugees, while at the same time nostalgically yearning for the day in which they can return to their homeland. � Vietnamese American Success and Contributions. The Vietnamese have been resettled throughout the U.S. with varying degree of success and California is home to many of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of the Vietnam. In California, there are large Vietnamese American communities in Orange County, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento. Vietnamese students make up one of the highest performing groups academically. Vietnamese Americans make up the 2nd largest world language in public schools, only after Spanish but before Chinese if Mandarin and Cantonese are considered different dialects. Vietnamese Americans have also made large contributions in high-tech businesses, health care, education, military high-ranking officers or government officials. Despite the successes, the Vietnamese American community remains the community which has the lowest level of education, low level of median income or most linguistically isolated, i.e., depending on language assistance.
Key Terms and Concepts: Vietnamese Americans, Refugees, Oral Histories
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Enhance understanding and analyze the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans by engaging in a variety of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, books, documentaries, scholarly articles, community programs and resources.
� Introduce the distinction between refugees, those who seek political and economic refuge as a result of the various wars taken place on Vietnam soil, and immigrants in America seeking for opportunity for a better life.
� Conduct an interview of someone who is a Vietnamese refugee or to listen to archived interviews of Vietnamese refugees. Students will develop and ask questions that explore the lived experiences of Vietnamese refugees. Students will record and transcribe the interviews. Students analyze the transcription and create a presentation (using various formats such as PowerPoint, video, paper) on the experiences of Vietnamese refugees.
Essential Questions:
1. What is the history of Vietnamese Americans in the U.S.?

2. How has the cultural perception of Vietnamese people and Vietnamese Americans been shaped and framed by mainstream discourse in the U.S?
3. How did the first-generation Vietnamese refugees' experiences differ from their children who were born in the U.S. How did their refugee status factor into differing experiences?
4. Why is the Vietnamese American experience important to understand within the context of Asian American studies and U.S. history? What are the differences between the refugee and immigrant experience?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher begins the lesson by asking students, "Tell me one think about you that shapes your experiences and how you see the world." This provides the students with the opportunity to hear the various perspectives. a. Students engage in writing "I am From..." poem. Students write a three-stanza poem that speaks to their identity, background, experience, and where they are from. Each line of the poem begins with "I am From..." and should follow something specific about their life, upbringing, and identity. Teachers can provide examples. Allow students 10-15 minutes to write their poem. After everyone has finished writing, students can share their poems in class throughout this lesson (5-6 poems shared per day).
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Vietnamese Americans and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher asks students about what they know about Vietnam and its relationship to the United States � "what comes to mind when you think of Vietnam?"
4. The teacher presents some basic information about Vietnamese American history and Vietnamese Americans via article, poem, PowerPoint or other presentation method. The teacher asks students, "what questions do you have about the refugee experience? what would you like to know more about the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans? Please write them down." a. National Geographic resettlement of Vietnamese refugees in the U.S.: https://www.nationalgeographic.org/media/resettling-vietnamese-refugees-unitedstates/ b.

KPBS How the Fall of Saigon made San Diego a refugee hub: https://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/apr/24/how-fall-saigon-made-san-diego-refugeehub/
5. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Vietnamese Americans in the U.S. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached. a. Students draft a set of questions that they would like to learn more about the Vietnamese refugees based on the information provided. Prompting questions may include: "What questions do you still have? Whose story is being told? Whose narrative is being left out?" The class compiles a list of shared questions.

6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Vietnamese refugee experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows the movie, Journey from the Fall, inspired by the true stories of Vietnamese refugees who fled their homeland after the fall of Saigon in 197 � and those who were forced to stay behind. As students watch the movie, they should note the hardships and difficulties Vietnamese refugees experienced in their struggle for freedom. Students are also asked to reflect on how the film addresses how refugees are being portrayed in the context of racism and discrimination in the U.S. a. Movie: Journey from the Fall (3 hours including bonus materials): http://www.journeyfromthefall.com/Home.aspx . April 30, 1975 marked the of Vietnam's civil war and the beginning of the exodus of hundred of thousands of refugees. Those remain in Vietnam were imprisoned in communist re-education camp, others escaped by boat and embarked on the arduous ocean voyage in search for freedom. Thousands of lives were lost as sea. For the lucky few who found refuge in other countries were later united with their families.
7. After the movie, students engage in a Think, Write, Pair/Share followed by Group Share exercise, guided by the following questions: a. How do Vietnamese Americans describe their refugee experience? b. How were/are Vietnamese refugees being perceived by both Vietnamese Americans and the American public? c. How was/is the Vietnamese refugee experience being shaped by racial and discrimination policy and practices in the U.S.? d. How are the Vietnamese refugee experiences similar to and different from other immigrant groups?
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� The wars in Southeast Asia have been framed by a general understanding in mainstream discourse of the Vietnam War as a proxy war to a global Cold War between two international superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union as a precursor to discussions surrounding communist/anti-communist political ideological difference and divide that would exacerbate the experiences of resettling Vietnamese later.
� Many Vietnamese refugees experience loss, trauma, sufferings as they flee their homeland and seeking political and economic refuge in a foreign land.
� Being caught between two worlds, Vietnamese American are neither accepted by the country they left behind or America given their refugee status, a reminder of the war that America played a role in it.
� Vietnamese American community development over the past four decades � its resettlement from refugee camps to recognized ethnic enclaves throughout California and the U.S.
� The racial inequalities and discriminatory practices to Asian Americans and how they negatively impact the Vietnamese community. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on the racial and socioeconomic disparities that communities of color experience (CA Governor's remarks about nail salons as the center of the widespread illness has a negative impact on the industry and its workers).
� Recognize the growth, development, and contributions that many Vietnamese Americans are making to the shape the diversity our America.

As students read through these articles, students reflect in the following questions: � Viet Thanh Nguyen's book Nothing Ever Dies begins with the statement that `All wars are fought twice: the first time on the battlefield, the second time in memory" � drawing from the assigned articles, how might this make sense for in different ways for the first generation of Vietnamese refugees and their secondgeneration Vietnamese American children? � What is it like to be Vietnamese Americans today? � How is the identity of Vietnamese Americans being shaped? What is visible and what is invisible?
9. Students conduct Oral Histories by interviewing Vietnamese refugees using the set of questions that the class has compiled in #4 above. Students can also personalize their project by considering how their personal and/or family stories connect to Vietnamese American experience and how the Vietnamese American experience connect to the larger historical narratives and how and why some narratives have been privileged over others. Lastly, students may consider how to improve their own community, what constructive actions can be taken, and whether they provide a model for change for those in other parts of the state, country, and world. a. See: REFUGENE Project "Record Family Stories" Storytelling Kit for oral history resources in partnership with the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations (UNAVSA): https://refugene.com/pages/refugenexunavsa

Some important things to point out in the interviews: b. How has the refugee experience shaped the identity of Vietnamese Americans? c. What are the stories that were told and what remain invisible? i. Why did some remain invisible? What conversation topics/themes were more difficult to talk about? d. What emotions and/or trauma arise from refugees in sharing their experiences? e. How do Vietnamese Americans see themselves in relation to other Asian American communities? f. What are the hopes and dreams for the next generation of Vietnamese Americans?
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework
Chapter 14 of the framework includes the civil rights movement of the 1960s which brought attention to the discrimination faced by various ethnic groups after generations of prejudice, discrimination, and discriminatory policies and practices against communities of color (Hispanic farm workers, Native, and Blacks protested against the heavy hand of racism in housing, employment, and educational opportunities). Following this civil rights movement, California's diversity increased only after President Johnson's immigration act of 1965, opening the door to increasingly large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Central America (page 297). Students may analyze the push-and-pull factors that contributed to shifting immigration patterns, but they should also learn about changes in immigration policy (page 299). Two guiding questions for this chapter include: 1) What did protests and frustrations expressed by Californians in the late Cold War Era reveal about the state?; 2) In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century?
9. Assessment � To show evidence of what students have learned, students can choose one the following assignments:
a. Write a 2-page essay answering each of the essential questions for this lesson using the evidence from the sources provided and the oral histories collected.
b. In small groups (3-4 students), create a digital presentation answering the essential questions for this lesson using the evidence from the sources provided and the oral histories collected (photos, video, interviews).

Quick Fact Sheet about Vietnamese Americans in the U.S.
� Vietnamese Americans (Ngi M gc Vit) are make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese (Ngi Vit hi ngoi, also known as Vit Kiu) and are the fourth-largest Asian American ethnic groups after Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.
� The Vietnamese community in the United States was minimal until the South Vietnamese refugees arrived in the U.S. following the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early refugees were refugee boat people who fled political persecution or sought economic opportunities as a result of U.S. involvement on the war in Vietnam.
� More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, primarily their large urban areas. Orange County, California is the home to the largest Vietnamese American population outside of Vietnam.
� As a relatively-recent immigrant group, most Vietnamese Americans are either first or second generation Americans. As many as one million people five years of age and older speak Vietnamese at home, making it the fifth-most-spoken language in the U.S.
� April 30, 1975 marked the fall of Saigon, which ended the Vietnam War, prompted the first large-scale wave of immigration; many with close ties to America or the South Vietnam government feared communist reprisals. Most of the first-wave immigrants were well-educated, financially comfortable, and proficient in English.
� From 1978 to mid-1980s marked the second wave of Vietnamese refugees. Political and economic instability under the new communist government led many to escape Vietnam by small, unsafe, crowded fishing boats. The second wave of refugees were generally lower socioeconomically, as most were peasant farmers or fishermen, small-town merchants or former military officials. Survivors were picked up by foreign ships and brought to asylum camps in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines from which they entered countries that agreed to accept them.
� After suffering war and psychological trauma, Vietnamese immigrants had to adapt to a very different culture. Language was the first barrier Vietnamese refugees with limited English proficiency had to overcome.
� Emotional health was considered an issue common to many Vietnamese refugees, with warrelated loss and the stress of adapting to a different culture leading to mental-health problems among refugees.
� Vietnamese Americans' income and social classes are diverse. Refugees arriving in the United States often had a lower socioeconomic standing in their home country and more difficulty integrating due to greater linguistic and cultural barriers.
� Vietnamese Americans have arrived in the U.S. primarily as refugees, with little or no money. While not as academically or financially accomplished collectively as East Asian counterparts,

census data indicates that Vietnamese Americans are an upwardly-mobile group; their economic status improved substantially between 1989 and 1999.
� Most first-wave Vietnamese immigrants initially worked at low-paying jobs in small services or industries. Finding work was more difficult for second-wave and subsequent immigrants, due to their limited educational background and job skills.
� Young Vietnamese Americans adults are well educated, and often provide professional services. Since older Vietnamese Americans have difficulty interacting with the non-Vietnamese professional class, many Vietnamese Americans provide specialized professional services to fellow immigrants.
� Vietnamese Americans are among the most-assimilated immigrant groups in the U.S. Although their rates of cultural and economic assimilation were comparable to other groups (perhaps due to language differences between English and Vietnamese), their rates of civic assimilation were the highest of the large immigrant groups. As political refugees, Vietnamese Americans viewed their stay in the U.S. as permanent and became involved in the political process at a higher rate than other groups.

Lesson Title: The Immigrant Experience of Lao Americans

Grade Level(s): 11th Grade

Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment:  Ethnic studies provide students the opportunity to engage with ethnic studies materials and content within their classrooms. They are exposed to a diverse curriculum that is meaningful and supportive.  Relevance- Ethnic studies provide students with an education that is culturally and community relevant  Ethnic studies draw extensively from the lived experiences and material realities of each individual student.  Community- Ethnic studies teaching and learning are meant to serve as a bridge between educational spaces/institutions and community. These studies encourage students to use their knowledge to become
agents of change, community builders, social justice organizers and advocates, and engaged global citizens.
Standards Alignment:  Integrate and evaluate multiple sources of information presented in diverse formats and media (e.g., visually, quantitatively, as well as in words) in order to address a question or solve a problem.  Present information, findings and supporting evidence, conveying a clear and distinct perspective, such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning, alternative or opposing perspectives are addressed and the organization, development, substance and style are appropriate to purpose, audience and a range of formal and informal tasks.  Offering and justifying opinions, negotiating with and persuading others in communicative exchanges  Expressing information and ideas in formal oral presentations on academic topics  Justifying own arguments and evaluating others' arguments in writing
Lesson Purpose and Overview (1-2 paragraph narrative explanation): Students will discuss the reasons for the changing immigration policies of the United States, with emphasis on how the Immigration Act of 1965 and successive acts transformed American society with focus on the unique challenges confronting Lao American immigrants and the different groups among them (i.e Lao, Hmong, Iu-Mien, Akha, etc). Students will learn how the lesser-known immigrants from Laos contributed to greater diversity in American society since the middle of the twentieth century.
Key Terms and Concepts (Ties into larger unit key terms but may also include terms specific to the lesson): The evolving US immigration policies since 1965, their effects on Lao Americans to their contributions to the diversity of the population of the United States of America.
Lesson Objectives: ("Students will be able to..."): 1. Discuss the reasons for the nation's changing immigration policy, with emphasis on how the Immigration Act of 1965 and successive acts have transformed American society 2. Understand the unique challenges confronting Lao American immigrants and the different groups among them (i.e Lao, Hmong, Iu-Mien, Akha, etc). 3. Examine the origins and stages of Lao American immigration and their effects on Lao Americans. 4. Learn how the lesser-known immigrants from Laos contributed to greater diversity in American society since the middle of the twentieth century. 5. Understand how the Vietnam War changed US immigration policy since 1975.
Essential Questions (Ties lesson to larger unit purpose): 1. Which period of US policy immigration did your family arrive in the United States? How has that policy supported/unsupported your family? 2. How has the immigration policies of 1975 and 1980 benefited the United States? 3. What current policies exist to support the original intentions of the United States as a country that receives all whom are oppressed?
Lesson Steps/Activities: 1. Instructor opens the class by giving a brief lecture on the following: At the end of the Vietnam War, the Royal

Lao Government was overthrown by the Pathet Lao in a communist revolution. Lao politically aligned individuals or families with the USA were allowed entry to the United States with the passage of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act in 1975. The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized further Lao refugee migration to the US. Between 1975 and 1992 with over 230,000 (up to 400,000 by some estimates) Lao, Hmong, Khmu, Iu-Mien, Tai-Dam, Tai Lue, Lua, Akha, Lahu and others from Laos immigrated to the US, especially to California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Texas. 2. The instructor then shows a short film clip on the Lao immigrant experience (`The Betrayal'). 3. Classroom
a. Individual Students read packet materials in-class to prepare for student presentations and discussion comparing and contrasting experiences of Lao immigrants, independently organizing information in note-taking guide while viewing video and reading, identifying and evaluating sources in each media format. (Model writing down points on organizer)
b. Small Group: Students assigned to one memoir/oral history account assemble in individual groups. Students discuss the main ideas and details of the memoir/oral history. They then create a visual display/poster that communicates the immigrant experience (e.g. isolate one quotation for presentation). (Instructor will demonstrate before small group discussion.)
c. Large Group: The class holds a discussion on Immigrant Experience of Lao Americans. Each student shares their response to the discussion. Students compare and contrast the unique and common/general aspects of each memoir/oral history account.
4. Homework: Students write to their local legislator about how Federal/State/Local government policy should be changed to better aid new immigrants in their integration to American society. Or, students may write a defense of why the US government should be responsible to assist migrants from Laos stemming from US involvement in the war in Laos.
