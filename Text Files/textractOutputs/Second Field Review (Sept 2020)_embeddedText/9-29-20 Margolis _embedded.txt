From: Allegra Margolis Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 4:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Public Comment Deadline 09/30/2020
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
I wanted to send an email regarding the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
1. It makes sense for lesson plans in California to include Jewish Americans, and recognize the diversity of Jews in national origin and background.
2. As we know anti-semitism is on the rise, therefore should include an accurate definition of anti-semitism and its history. Check out some resources from the ADL here.
3. Know that you are involving public comment for the curriculum - appreciate you hearing our voice.
Cheers, Allegra Margolis
