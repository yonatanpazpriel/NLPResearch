From: Lee, Roselinn ( Linn ) Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Angelina Fa Subject: [EXTERNAL] Add Sample Lesson on the Model Minority Myth to Appendix B Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission,
Attached please find a lesson on the Model Minority Myth as it pertains to Asian Americans. This is one of the main issues facing all Asian American groups because of the harmful effects of being invisible, being glossed over when it comes to needed social services and aid, and being ignored in the classrooms because teachers feel all Asians are smart, lumped into one monolithic group when in fact Asian Americans are the most diverse in nationalities, languages, cultures and ethnicities. It is critically important that the students learn about it's origin, harmful effects and ways to dispel the myth. It was taken out of the original draft. Angelina Fa and I have taken it and improved it. Please add it with very little edits.
