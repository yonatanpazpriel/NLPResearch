From: AOL Sent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 4:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Purging CA curriculum on antisemitic content and adding Jewish studies
To whom it may concern:
We have been extremely concerned about antisemitic content in the CA curriculum, and ask that you please include the following:
1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
2. An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
3. Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. 4. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the
development of a final ESMC.
Please purge antisemitism from the curriculum. We are grateful to be citizens of a state that values and respects diversity.
Thank you for your kind consideration.
Julie and Seth Jacobs
