Dear IQC,
I fully recognize and support the need to educate our youth on the history of discrimination and bigotry that has marred our proud history as a country and the value of teaching history from multiple perspectives rather than a single one.
Having said that, I am deeply troubled about the following events that have transpired with the new draft curriculum for Ethnic Studies (ESMC):
1. An initial draft that was clearly antisemitic and anti-Israel in its content 2. A commitment to have an open and transparent process that was clearly violated by the
"stroke of midnight" inclusion of Arab-Americans when there had been an agreement that it would only cover four traditional ethnic studies groups ï¿½ African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans. 3. A second draft that remains fundamentally flawed.
Obviously, if Arab-Americans are to be included, there are many other ethnic minority Americans that should be included from a long list of that have suffered bigotry. That list includes Jews who have faced antisemitism in America through the generations, be it historical quotas at colleges, restrictions in co-ops or certain neighborhoods where they were not welcome to love to more blatant actions of discrimination and hatred.
I urge you to incorporate the following into your final curriculum for ESMC so that it is evenhanded and fair to all parties.
1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.

2. An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
3. Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. 4. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of
a final ESMC.
Thank you for taking my comments in the spirit in which they are given.
Best
