From: Steve Luner Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 2:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
I am quite concerned about the direction in which the drafting of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum has taken. It has made some improvement but is still largely an antisemitic document. I am sure you have been receiving plenty of comments about this dangerous tendency, and am writing to add my name to the list of those who have been alarmed by this development. Stephen J. Luner, Ph.D.
