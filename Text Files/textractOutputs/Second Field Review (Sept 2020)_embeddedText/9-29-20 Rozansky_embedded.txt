From: [email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 8:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnics Studies course
A sound Ethnic Studies course should promote respect among students by teaching about the diverse histories, cultures, and contributions to our nation.
Jewish Americans should be included in the Ethnics Study curriculum. The studies course should also include a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry.
