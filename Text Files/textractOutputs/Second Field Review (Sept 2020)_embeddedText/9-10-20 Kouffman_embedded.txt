Hello
I am writing to encourage you to include Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews in California's Ethnic Studies curriculum. It is important for children to see themselves reflected in the culture around them and Jews with Middle Eastern backgrounds are a significant population in California.
It is important that Californian students learn that the Middle East, like most areas, is comprised of people of various faith backgrounds, ethnicities, and so forth. Presenting it as a homogeneous area will do students a disservice, as this is an incorrect portrayal.
