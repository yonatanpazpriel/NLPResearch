From: Barbara Ash Sent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 10:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum needs further improvement
I request acceptance of the following FOUR items related to the ESMC:
1. The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism. The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) definition includes traditional tropes, the growing problem of Holocaust denial, and the new forms that related to Israel, such as demonizing the Jewish State or holding local Jewish communities responsible for its actions.
2. No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future.
3. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color.
4. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
It is the intension of BDS to engender hate towards Jews and Israel. I hope that is not YOUR intension. Without safeguards, the curriculum will engender increased hate and prejudice rather than understanding and respect for Jews and for all ethnicities.
Sincerely, Barbara Ash
