From: Lee, Roselinn ( Linn ) Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 3:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Sophia Chhoeng Subject: [EXTERNAL] Appendix B Lesson on Cambodian Americans for the Asian American and Pacifica Islander Studies Sample Lessons
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission, Attached is a lesson on Cambodian Americans, "Deportation Breaking Families Apart". This will be an important addition to the sample lessons in the Ethnic Studies model curriculum that represents one of the groups within the Asian Pacific Islander community that has suffered from the effects of the war in Vietnam and now deportations. The Southeast Asian refugee communities are a part of Asian American history and need to be recognized and no longer glossed over. Please insert this into Appendix B under Asian American Studies. This lesson has been reviewed, edited and approved by Cambodian Family Community Center, a community organization in Santa Ana California, that serves both the Cambodian and Latinx community.
