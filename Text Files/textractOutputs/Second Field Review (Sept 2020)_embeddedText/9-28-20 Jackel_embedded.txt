Dear IQC: The proposed ethnic studies curriculum, especially with the addition of the "proposed lesson on the Arab American experience" is flawed in that it assumes 1. all Arabs are "Asian," 2. no Jews are "Asian," 3. all Arabs are "people of color" and 4. no Jews are "people of color."
I am 100% Jewish; my Jewish roots go back at least as far as my great, great, great grandparents on both sides.
However, according to my DNA, 50.8 % of my "genetic ancestors" are "Western Asian and North African," (including 14.2% "Arab, Egyptian and Levantine") and 46.2% of my "genetic ancestors" are "European." Yet, as a "Jew," the drafters of the proposed curriculum say that I am "white" and not a "person of color." This is misguided, unfair, and imho, racist and anti-Semitic.
I am not unique in terms of my ancestors' ethnicity. Calling all Jews "white" is wrong; calling all Arabs "people of color" is also wrong. The curriculum should be amended because it wrongfully excludes Middle Eastern Communities in California including Jews, Iranians, Arabs, Kurds, Assyrian Christians, Coptic Christians, and others.
I would support a curriculum based on the experiences of "Middle Eastern Americans."
Thank you.
