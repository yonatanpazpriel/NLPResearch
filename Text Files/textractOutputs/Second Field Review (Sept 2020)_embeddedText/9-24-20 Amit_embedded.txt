Dear curriculum designers,
I am excited by the renewed emphasis of ethnic studies in California to recognize and empower minorities and ethnic groups. I am, however, worried that the effort is being politicized with unwarranted and unbalanced propaganda. Information is circulated that a chapter on Arab-Americans is being added without review and public commentary, and that previous content that was massively biased is being put back in the curriculum.
Please don't allow this to happen. It is perfectly reasonable to include content on Arab-Americans in the curriculum, but it should receive the same kind of transparency and public commentary as any other content.
With respect and regards,
Alon Amit, Ph.D. Los Altos, CA
