Hello, I am a student from the University at Buffalo who has been truly scared for the future. I hope that you understand the possibilities of hate and the affect that this will have to the already endangered Jewish communities. Please do not do this and understand that you are excluding Jewish voices and people that are trying to make the world a better place. Please do not pass this new curriculum as it absolutely will spread hate and if you're unaware of this then it is time to educate yourselves. Thank You -Kayla Revivo Student | School of Public Health and Health Professions
