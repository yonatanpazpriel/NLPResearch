Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic studies.
It's to the benifit to all stake holders of our American society to teach ethnic studies to our students. We are weaving the social fabric of our American society. It creates winwin on all sides.
Teaching our students ethnic studies builds character.
One of many Ethnic studies's goal is incorporating love for every community, culture and faith. "Once we love each other, we begin that pursuit of freedom for everyone, so everyone can experience what's it's like to live truly free.
Research-based ethnic studies in K-12 schools has great promise to address structural and individual inequities and injustices in society. To make schools a true equalize. Thank ethnic studies is the only path forward"
Ethnic Studies celebrates students' multi-identities. It increases their (grade point average), improves their attendance, and empowers them to advocate for themselves, their families and communities. An authentic ethnic studies pedagogy improves intercultural relation, and humanizes the student and teacher
White privilege is your history being part of the core curriculum and mine being taught as an elective."
For all of these reasons and more, we need ethnic studies in our curriculum.
Thank you. Department of Navy electronics engineering manager. Advocacy/community organizer.
-Regards Wedad
