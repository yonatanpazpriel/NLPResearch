Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
As the Japanese-American grandson of a retired MIS/CIA that served the United States during the WW2 era, I am distraught at the idea of excluding or censoring the treatment of certain minority US citizens during that time. I am a strong believer that those who do not study history are doomed to repeat it, and given the potential for massive instability between our country and other foreign powers in the future, I believe it is crucial that we keep the American internment camp experience in our curriculum. Please reconsider this decision.
Regards, Steven Sakamoto
