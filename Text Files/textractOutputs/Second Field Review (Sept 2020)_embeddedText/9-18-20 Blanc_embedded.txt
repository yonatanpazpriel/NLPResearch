What is the matter with you? Aside from the need to focus on basic education in the curriculum why are adding these kinds of studies to an already poor bottom tiered education system?
And now you cater to Arabs and dispargage Jews? Terrible I am asking you to get out of your "looserthink" and at minimum:
Include a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism.
Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
