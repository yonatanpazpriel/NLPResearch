Unfortunately, it has become apparent that our schools need to step in to teach our young people fairness, equality and respect for others. It has a tough job, with so many conflicting interests and opinions. When reviewing the subject matter and issues, I urge you not to promote one minority group over another and not to endorse any ideas that denigrate any group in order to elevate a different minority. Specifically, I am concerned that Jews are being negatively portrayed and that Israel is being singled out as an imperialistic state, that the BDS movement is praised. Teach the children the good that every person and every group has to offer, teach them to be idealistic when it comes to race relations. Politics should not enter into these lessons.
