To Whom It May Concern,
It is critical to have an ethnic class to educate students about people's history and heritage. With regards to the Jewish people, the following are my concerns.
1. We need to have an accurate, realt time description of anti - semitism, how it's played out and lesson plans developed by experts around this topic. History if repeated itself before our eyes and we must take action.
2. We must have transparency, input from experts and the ability to comment throughout the process of developing the curriculum.
3. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans should recognize the diversity of the community - including Ashkenazi, Sephardic , and Jews of color.
4. Similarly, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should include Jewish Americans from North Africa and middle eastern countries.
Please take my comments into account. I have had too many direct experiences of anti-semitism. We have to educate thoroughly and early.
Thank You,
