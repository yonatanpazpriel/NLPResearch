Dear IQC Further to my previous comments regarding the proposed "Arab American" lesson plan as part of the "ethnic studies" curriculum, I hope you read and consider the attached article. I now understand that there is "ethnic studies" and there is "critical ethnic studies." The former is fine. The latter is political, biased and narrow, in that all actors are portrayed either as "oppressors" or "oppressed." Not surprisingly, in this discipline, Jews are in the "oppressor" class and "Arabs" are "oppressed." These kind of biased narratives have no business in any California classroom. Thank you for considering this. Here is the link: https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/322152/the-anti-zionism-of-critical-ethnic-studies/
Yours sincerely, Nora Rousso
