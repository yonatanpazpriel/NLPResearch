From: Myron & Felissa Cagan Sent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 4:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] request to accept and pledge to the following FOUR requests related to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear CA Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC):
As a citizen of California I request that you please accept, and pledge to include, the following four positions as a part of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC):
1. The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism.
2. No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future.
3. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color.
4. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
If we are going to teach our children about the different ethnic groups that make up our California society we must do it in a manner that does not perpetuate any hate or dislike of any such group. The classroom teaching must be positive about all ethnic groups that are discussed. The ultimate goal should be to have citizens that are informed about, & tolerant of, all ethnic groups. Our society needs to educate it's children to be tolerant of all & repulsed by bigotry & xenophobia.
Political/policy issues regarding the policies of various countries need to be discussed in political forums outside of the ethnic studies context. The political policies of any country must NOT be convoluted with prejudice or derogatory attitudes towards any ethnic group.
Respectfully, Myron Cagan
