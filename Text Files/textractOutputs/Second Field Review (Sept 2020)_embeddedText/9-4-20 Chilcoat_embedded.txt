I'll cut to the chase - what the hell is weong with you people? It is NOT your responsibility to teach our children about BLM or police brutality.
How about sticking to math, history and science? BLM is a Marxist group and police brutality - seriously?? BLM doesn't care about "black lives" unless it goes along with their narrative. Thousands of black babies are aborted every year along with black on black murder.
This is shameful and disgusting and I pray parents start pulling their kids out of public school and you can all be out of a job.
