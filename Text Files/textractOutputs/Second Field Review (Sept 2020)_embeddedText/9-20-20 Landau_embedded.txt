From: Judith Landau Sent: Sunday, September 20, 2020 4:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 2020 - second draft
As a "civilian" member of the Jewish community - i.e. not a member of a specific organization - I strongly urge you to follow the guidelines proposed by the Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California: https://www.jpac-cal.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/JPAC-position-statement-on-ES2020.pdf
Antisemitic and anti-Israel tendencies should have absolutely no place in an Ethnic Studies program for students, whether in California, or anywhere else.
Thank you Judith Landau San Diego, California
