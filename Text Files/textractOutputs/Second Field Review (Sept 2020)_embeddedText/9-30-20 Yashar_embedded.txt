To whom it may concern:
I am a huge proponent of ethnic studies and I believe it is crucial for others to learn about various backgrounds in order to better understand one another, increase empathy for all people, and remain educated on how not to repeat history that has been destructive. I am disappointed that the curriculum proposed contains anti-semetic elements that do not include any mention of antisemitism. This is a significant issue as anti-semitism is on the rise and a large population of the younger generation are not properly informed of the holocaust or anti-semitism in general, which leads to it being perpetuated. The only way history does not repeat itself, is when history is spoken about and addressed. In 2019 when this legislation was proposed, the Jewish community raised their concerns and in 2020 it appeared that the concerns had been addressed, but the result was that anti-semetic content was injected without any transparency. I am asking that you strike out anti-Semitic content from the curriculum, include a lesson on anti-semitism, and please talk about Israel in an objective manner, not coded in anti-semitism.
I thank you for your efforts.
Sincerely, Leah Yashar
