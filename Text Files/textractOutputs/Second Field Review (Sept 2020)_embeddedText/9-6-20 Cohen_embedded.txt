> AB 331 invites hateful antisemitic rhetoric, which should never be allowed. There is no reason why the Jews need to be attacked in order to end discrimination against blacks. It is unfathomable that such curriculum would be not only allowed but endorsed by the government in the United States. Many American citizens would be appalled by being forced to have their children learn to hate a particular race. It is unacceptable.
