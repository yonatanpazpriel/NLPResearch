From: Randy Savarese Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 7:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-semitic and anti-Israel lesson plan
I understand that you have recently reinstated a lesson plan into the new curriculum that is both anti-Semitic and antiIsrael. I am requesting that you remove that lesson plan. This kind of bias can lead to widespread misunderstanding as states often borrow curricula from one another to save costs. The Jewish community considers this an injustice and very much wishes for you to remove that particular lesson plan for the new Ethnic Studies course for high schools in California. Thank you, Randy Savarese
