From: Judy Faitek Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 1:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ethnic studies curriculum
I am a retired teacher who lives in San Diego. I am writing to comment on the ethnic studies curriculum specifically dealing with anti semitism.
Even though most Jews can blend in with the majority population, a large minority of Jews are of Middle East or African American background and don't blend in. Aside from this, many Jews of all backgrounds live with the sting of discrimination. I have felt this discrimination both as a student and as a teacher. I am asking that you include lessons on Jewish hatred in the new curriculum.
The International Holocaust Alliance has provided a multi-layered definition of anti semitism that could serve as the basis for lessons in this curriculum. The Anti Defamation League also has a series of lessons that could be used.
Anti semitism is called the longest hatred for a reason. Let's start a program to educate our children and end this hatred once and for all.
Sincerely,
Judy Faitek
