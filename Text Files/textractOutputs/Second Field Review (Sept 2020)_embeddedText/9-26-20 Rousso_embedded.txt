Dear ICQ: Please consider the fact that California students are among the most ignorant about the Holocaust, even though we have an approved curriculum for same. Part of this is because students are still being taught that Jews are "other." Chapter 3, Page 31, Line 803: should read as follows: "the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence, hatred, and rhetoric".
