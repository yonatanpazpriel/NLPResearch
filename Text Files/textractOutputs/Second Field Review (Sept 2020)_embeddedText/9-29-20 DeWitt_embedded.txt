From: Sanne DeWitt Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 12:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
Dear Sirs and Madams,
My name is Susanne Kalter Dewitt and I live in Berkeley, California, [Address Redacted]
I object to the requirement of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum as a requirement for Graduation of California schools. It is full of stereotypes of Jews, promotes BDS and is objectionable to the Indigenous Pio;ulations, the Armenian population and to the Jewish population. It is a very biased curriculum and will cause damage to the populations.
I urge you to revise this curriculum or, better yet, to drop it entirely.
Sincerely, Susanne DeWitt
