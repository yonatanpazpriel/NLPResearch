Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
As the Director of the UCLA Asian American Studies Center, I am writing in support of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) urging that following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on:
� Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community � Cambodian Americans � Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At a minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Asian Indian Americans and Pacific Islanders. These ethnic and national groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
I have been an educator for 25 years and understand how important it is that the curricula be inclusive of the groups who are receiving the instruction. There are symbolic as well as tangible benefits to the inclusion a broad spectrum of ethnic and national groups at this level of policy guidance. I add the term `national' groups, as there are many Native Hawaiians and indigenous groups that remain committed to their identity and future in sovereign terms as a nation.
There is also a growing amount of research and curricula being developed on Asian American and Pacific Islander communities that would be helpful for the Commission. I have attached a list of curricula and resources on the topic of Japanese American incarceration as an example.
In closing, I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November. I would be happy to connect you with content experts through my Asian American Studies scholarly and professional networks for this process.
Respectfully,
Karen Umemoto, Ph.D. Helen and Morgan Chu Chair and Director, Asian American Studies Center Professor, Departments of Urban Planning and Asian American Studies
