Dear CDE,
Please do not alter the Arab-American sample lesson in the ethnic studies curriculum. It is important to acknowledge that while Jewish minorities have faced atrocities, they can also conduct atrocities. The BDS movement is critical to securing human rights for a displaced population and requiring that everyone follow international human rights laws.
As a Black biracial, ethnically Jewish woman, and doctoral candidate who works at a conservative Jewish day school in southern CA, I can promise you that this community has severe racist and Islamophobic perspectives and their concerns with the Arab-American sample lesson should be taken with a grain of salt. The racism in this community is so prevalent that even Jewish people of Persian, Mexican, or African-American backgrounds are bullied, less likely to be married in the community, and face challenging learning and social experiences in school.
When phrases like "protect our children's education" are being used in regards to an ethnic studies curriculum, one can recognize the deep-seated racism at work. I implore you to disregard the perspectives of these "concerned" white Jewish parents and see them for what they are, an attempt for them to continue their racist ideologies and stay in power.
The creation of an ethnic studies curriculum in CA has made me so hopeful for the future of our children. Please do allow the culture in power to detract from our goal of creating a pluralistic and multicultural society.
Best, Meagan Brown Varona, M.S.
