This concept has no place in this study program--by itself itis racist and it must be removed. Study the history of different groups, especially Jewish who are singled out by bias and prejudice and see their struggles to achieve, to be admitted, to be accepted and then derstand that there was no privilege, just hard work and persistence. Please reevaluate this document . Thank you. William G. Gottfried MD
