Re: Hindu American Foundation Comments on ESMC
Dear Members of Instructional Quality Commission:
My name is Samir Kalra, Esq. and I am a native Californian and the Managing Director at the Hindu American Foundation. The Hindu American Foundation (HAF) is an educational and advocacy organization established in 2003. HAF focuses on educating the public about Hindus and Hinduism and advocating for policies and practices that ensure the well-being of all people and the planet.
We have thoroughly reviewed the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) proposed for the 2021-2022 academic year. While we understand and appreciate that not all ethnic groups will be represented, we do ask that the Commission please examine spaces where inclusion of the Hindu American population can happen.
The Hindu American community, estimated at 3.2 million, represents diverse ethnic backgrounds, including but not limited to individuals of Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Malaysian, Indonesian, Afghani, Nepali, Bhutanese, Sri Lankan, Fijian, Caribbean, African, and European descent. The majority of Hindus, however, are of Indian ethnic origin and are primarily an immigrant community. It was only after the lifting of the Asian Exclusion Act of 1924 in 1943, and the abolishment of quotas for immigrants based on national origin in 1965, that Indians and Hindus from other countries came to the United States in large numbers. Many Hindus have come to the U.S. as students or in search of better economic opportunities, while others have arrived in this country after facing religious persecution in their country of origin, such as Afghanistan and Bhutan. In the last few years, for example, approximately 90,000 Bhutanese (primarily Hindus) have been resettled across the country after being forcibly evicted from Bhutan in the 1990s and living in refugee camps in Nepal for nearly 20 years.
We are asking that all Asian American groups are adequately and fairly represented in this course outline.Many of the sample lessons are centered around particular groups (Hmong, Japanese, Chinese) and it is important to note that there

have been significant contributions to the United States and California by many Asian American groups. In particular, the history of immigration from India is quite rich and well documented, please ensure that all Asian American groups are equally and equitably presented in this section.
To be clear, we support the ESMC effort to fully address the historic and present-day experience of African American, Asian American, Chicano and Latino and Native Americans. This is especially so given the past and ongoing experience of these groups with systemic racism and marginalization, including in mainstream high school curricula. But, fully addressing these issues should not come at the expense of, and by marginalizing, other ethnic groups. As AB 2016 so clearly states, the broader term "ethnicity" (not just race or skin color) should be the criteria used when deciding which groups to feature in the ESMC. A curriculum based on a narrowly focused and politicized approach consciously and erroneously divides Californians into "people of color," on the one hand, and all other supposedly ethnic and non-ethnic whites, on the other. California legislators envisioned a multi-cultural approach to ethnic studies in which the focus is for students to gain a deeper understanding of American society and its diverse ethnic composition and to develop respect for cultural diversity in our pluralistic society.
Based on a review of the legislative record with the support of counsel, we believe that inclusivity was a vital principle of the legislature's intention when they passed AB 2016. This was not reflected in the more narrowly focused curriculum, which the CDE released in 2019 and appears ready to bring again with limited and inadequate revisions. As you know, AB 2016 calls for the state's educational standards to be "guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" and notes the objective of preparing pupils "with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."
Governor Newsom has outlined a vision of a "California for All" in which inclusiveness is a paramount principle. In that spirit, we are committed to working with you to incorporate the full spectrum of experiences of ethnic communities to ensure that California students receive a comprehensive education about the full ethnic diversity of the State. We would like to express our reservations as to the groups that have not been included and accordingly include a number of comments to help improve the model curriculum below.

While recognizing that the term Asian American is a broadly defined term, I would suggest listing the countries that comprise that population that is Asian American for clarity and transparency. The word Coolie is a slur against low-wage, immigrant laborers. Please use a less culturally loaded word. Please define what is meant by "Southern Asiana"

Arvind Sharma and Katherine K. Young - for Readings that analyze the ways that intersectionality impacts the feminist movement by comparing and contrasting waves of feminism and who is represented. Students will develop a plan of action to counter patriarchal norms and gender roles through the creation of a working document that includes strategies for being ally in the current women's movement The Srila Roy book New South Asian Feminisms: Paradoxes & Possibilities may be too complex for high school students, we strongly suggest switching it out with We should all be Feminists as it is a more comprehensive reading primer for understanding the feminist movement and calls for proactive and inclusive approaches to challenging situations.
We recommend adding E xamining the Impact of Mahatma Gandhi on Social Change Movements as it highlights the work of Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta and the United Farm Workers movement. Also, The Dharma of Cezar Chavez explains how Chavez's personal and professional life were shaped by his spirituality and community. Please include Swami Viveknanda in Unit 3: Asian American Settlement and Exclusion as his visits to California in 1900 greatly influenced the Hindu South Asian Diaspora and led to the Vedanta Society Berkeley. Please include the following places for possible field trips to conduct ethnographic exploration of the ways Asian American Social Movements have transformed higher education:

Please consider adding the California Alien Land Law of 1913, as one of the topics for analytical essays where students will analyze primary documents to write about. The California Alien Land Law of 1913 (also known as the Webb-Haney Act) which prohibited "aliens ineligible for citizenship" from owning agricultural land or possessing long-term leases over it, but permitted leases lasting up to three years. It affected the Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Korean immigrant farmers in California. This was one of the many documented anti-Asian prejudices and laws that impacted California Asian Americans.
Please add the following to the list of movements that are rooted in a central problem that the Asian American community was facing. Students will also be studying the praxis of each of the movements to prepare for the Youth Participatory Action Research projects that they will do in their final unit:
 Lala Rajput Rai - UC Berkely  - Rai, the founder of the India Home Rule League of America, visited the United States to meet with African Americans and the small Indian community across the country.

Congress passed the Hart-Celler Act in 1965, which scrapped the quota based on national origin, replacing it with a preferences-based system. This set the stage for a significant population of Hindus to immigrate to the United States.
