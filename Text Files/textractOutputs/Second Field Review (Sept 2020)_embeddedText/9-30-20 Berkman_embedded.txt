Dear IQC and SBE Members,
Hundreds of thousands of Jewish Israelis, many of them non-white, have immigrated to the United States and become citizens. Will they be covered appropriately in the Middle East immigrants section? Or is that section only for Muslim Middle Easterners?
There is active anti-semitism, e.g. the shooting at the Poway Chabad center, the mobs in Charlottesville chanting on TV "the Jews will not replace us!", the removal of all the Jewish women from the Women's March leadership. And now, many progressive groups in the name of "intersectionality" are biased against Jews.
DeSean Jackson,a native Californian and a star football player at U.C. Berkeley from 2005-2007, is now playing in the NFL. He made headlines July 6 with an anti-semitic/racist story he posted on Instagram saying "Hitler was right!" and accusing the Jews of planning for world domination.
As for the Middle East section, why has it been hidden from public view? Will it be neutral or blame everything on Israel.
I urge you to revise the ESMC to: 1. Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism in all its forms.

2. Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA. 3. Remove "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
In order to make these changes, I urge you to follow the specific recommendations made here:
