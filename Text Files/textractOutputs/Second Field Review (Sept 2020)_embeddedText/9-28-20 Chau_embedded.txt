Re:

Representation of the Sikh Community in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum

Dear California Department of Education and Instructional Quality Commission Members:

I write to you regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum currently under consideration.

It is my understanding that over the last year, thousands of California Sikhs and 52 California Sikh houses of worship have expressed to the California Department of Education (CDE) and Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) why it is critical that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum have a specific and nuanced approach of Sikh history in California and throughout the United States. To that end, members of the Sikh community have submitted lesson plans that provide a rich context of Sikh contributions to American and Californian history that goes beyond recent history. These contributions include their powerful immigration stories to the State for more than 125 years and their involvement in anti-racist and wider Asian American movements, amongst others.

It is imperative the contributions of all ethnic minority groups have a thorough representation in the model curriculum. I hope the CDE and IQC will consider the Sikh community's recommendations and further recognize that a strong Ethnic Studies framework that advances a comprehensive education, while accurately representing communities, is critical to California's well-being.

Sincerely,
