From: JEFFREY CARMEL Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 4:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns
Dear CDE,
You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools. The following are items of serious concern:
The guiding values and principles invite BDS; the Critical Ethnic Studies Association (which is pushing these values and problematic revisions to the ESMC) advocates BDS; and the Arab section that will be added in November has already called for BDS.
* The Guiding Values directly reference, and are based on, specific pages from a book called Education at War, which is referenced in the Curriculum. The relevant section of the book encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives.
* Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA) advocates BDS
� All 13 members of the founding board of CESA (2011 - 2012) are BDS movement activists.
� The Critical Ethnic Studies Association (CESA) membership passed a "Resolution on Academic Boycott of Israeli Academic Institutions." (July, 2014)
� The four past conferences of the CESA each had multiple sessions condemning Israel and promoting BDS. Sample conference workshop: "Critical Ethnic Studies Association Workshop: Intro to Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement."
* Arab section was officially added in September but is not available for review. BDS was in the first draft's Arab section along with other egregious anti-Zionist material. Those who spoke in favor of the inclusion of the Arab section at the September IQC meeting made clear that "Free Palestine" needed to be included. BDS is the movement called for by the Guiding Values if Palestine is included.
Sincerely,
Jeffrey A. Carmel, M.D. Adjunct Professor Stanford University School of Medicine
