Good day,
With the recent proposed curriculum updates, I stand by inclusion and no new lessons of racial hate (i.e. too many generations were taught false African-American history, let's not repeat this error with other ethnic groups).
Specifically, the lesson plan for Arab Americans should refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent and include, at the very least, a side bar of Jewish Americans in general. This includes the diversity of Jews from various parts of the world.
The curriculum must include an accurate definition of antisemitism and appropriate accompanying lessons on antisemitism. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010, should be used.
I do hope and trust that the state will only permit and promote curriculum that is accurate and respects the integrity of all ethnicities.
