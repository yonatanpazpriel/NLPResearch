From: junebrott On Behalf Of Dorothy June BRott Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:04 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; [emails redacted] Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Political Agenda from CA Ethnic Studies
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and Governor Gavin Newsom,
I am deeply concerned the current (and second) draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Drastic revisions are needed. Why does such a document need to include a political agenda--which is obvious especially in the "Guiding Values and Principles."
What is "transformative post-imperial resistance?" Is that a fancy new jargon name for saying it's ok to hate 'certain people?
The Arab-Israel conflict has NOTHING to do with California school children ---but it's obvious of great importance to the people writing the Curriculum, who dislike Israel and want California children to be tutored in hatred and to join the BDS hate movement.
Please VETO THIS UNFAIR AND HARMFUL CURRICULUM!
Sincerely, Dorothy June BRott
