From: Ketzia Schoneberg Sent: Thursday, September 17, 2020 3:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern,
As a native Californian, I am deeply disturbed that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum plans not to include Jewish American studies and antisemitism in their new curriculum. This is astonishing and disturbing to me, particularly as a member of the Jewish community, who does not identify as white, and who has experienced regular antisemitism while in my California high school, and in college at San Francisco State University and the San Francisco Art Institute as an undergraduate, and in the workplace as well.
It is essential in this age that antisemitism and the Jewish American experience should be taught, particularly as the numbers of young people who have never heard of the Holocaust, and/or who believe that Jews themselves caused the Holocaust.
Be inclusive. Do the right thing. I am a firm supporter of Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ Lives Matter, and that all people are equal. You can do better, and I hope that you choose to.
Sincerely,
