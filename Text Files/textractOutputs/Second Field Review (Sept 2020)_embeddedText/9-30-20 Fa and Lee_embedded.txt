From: Angelina Fa Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 9:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Addition to Appendix B: Important Asian American Historical Figures
This additional lesson plan on Important Asian American Historical Figures is essential. There are only 2 UC approved high school courses in Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies in the entire state of California, the courses documented in Appendix A - Asian American Studies from San Francisco Unified and Garden Grove Unified's course Vietnamese American History.
It would be very difficult for classroom teachers to generate a list of key Asian American figures and devise a lesson like this. Please insert this lesson into Appendix B. The lesson plan is pasted below and attached.
Thank you for your consideration!
