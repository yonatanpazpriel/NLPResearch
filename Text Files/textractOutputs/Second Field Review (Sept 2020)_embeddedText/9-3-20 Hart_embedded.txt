I'm a parent of a child in the public school system, the teaching of "white man bad" is inherently racist. Teaching that capitalism is exploitation is also incorrect. Capitalism has room for improvements, but it has time and time again been the best and only system which offers large numbers of people a way out of poverty. To date, communism and its close relative, socialism, have killed millions.
Stop this nonsense. Stop poisoning young minds. Look at Portland and ask yourself if you'd be proud to be a parent of one of the rioters. Rioting our way to soicialism will fail. It will fail.
The destruction of California is well on its way and passage of this disastrous bill will seal the deal. But maybe that's the goal your curriculum hopes to achieve? I only know this, socialism and racism in any form is wrong. Throughout history socialism has been defeated over and over again because it doesn't work. So if you win this round and the next, know your days of success will end. And Capitalism will again reign supreme.
