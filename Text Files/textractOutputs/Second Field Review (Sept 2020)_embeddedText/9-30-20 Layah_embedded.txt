In a program with such significant backing from the vast financial and educational resources of the State of California, how something like your lesson and activity on the Irish and Jews could get close to the final product is astonishing.
It is far beyond a mere editorial oversight. With wording, objectives and activity planning so intricately crafted, it seems only an individual with deep-seated feelings of bigotry could have constructed such hateful material. Further, it reflects poorly on all of those involved in the project as both the general atmosphere and especially the oversight must be called into question. Whether indeed a well-intended idea has been hijacked, or an ill-intended idea driven by some which fooled other well-meaning people has arrived at this point, this project offers the opposite of its claimed objective.
The way of the world is that often, falsehood starts fast or strong and is impressive, while the truth appears slow or weak. It may take time -- even years or more -- but truth emerges strong and lasting while falsehood crumbles. Those who believe they are now on the path to their objectives, with perhaps greater, more powerful (often selfishly-motivated personal) prizes waiting in the wings, need merely look back at history. Their actions cannot stand up to the scrutiny of truth, and their (potential) temporary victories will yield to frustration, anxiety, disappoinment or even humiliation.
With that in mind, we respectfully appeal to those of you truly desiring a peaceful, harmonious society in California and beyond to reconsider this project in its entirety.
Ironically, and meaningfully, there may be no better example of the above than the history of the Jews.
