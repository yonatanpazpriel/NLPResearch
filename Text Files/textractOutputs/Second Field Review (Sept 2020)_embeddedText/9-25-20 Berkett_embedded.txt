From: Bryan Berkett Sent: Friday, September 25, 2020 1:56 PM To Whom It May Concern, As a proud Californian voter, I think it is important that the ethnic studies curriculum taught in our schools reflect a broad range of experiences. Accordingly, it is very important to me, and my family, that the curriculum include the following:
1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism
2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded
3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans
4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing to the ESMC
This is very important to me and I appreciate your support. Thank you.
Kindly, Bryan Berkett
