September, 30, 2020
Dear Committee,
I'm writing to you as a retired elementary teacher that taught thirty-three years for San Diego City Schools. I am also the daughter of Holocaust survivors. After reading the proposed Ethnic Studies course under California AB331, I must speak out about the new draft.
The July 2020 ESMC draft is restricted to four groups- African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinx Americans. The Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum. Unfortunately, the antisemitic and anti-Israel bias of the 2019 draft was found in the lesson plan.
I must speak out when I see an unjust bias in the proposed lesson plan. This antisemitic and Anti-Israel bias must be addressed and changed.
Sincerely, Esther Kaplan
