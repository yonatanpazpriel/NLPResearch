I am writing at the suggestion of Senator Diane Feinstein to once again let you know my concern that the new curriculum should have a component on anti-semitism as well as the Jewish American experience. In a time of increasing anti-Semitism it is even more important that students become aware of our culture as well as the culture of other minorities in order to help develop a sense of shared people hood. Thank you for considering my thoughts.
