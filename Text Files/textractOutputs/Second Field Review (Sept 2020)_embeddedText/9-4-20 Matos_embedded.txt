HelloThere is no way I will allow my children to be part of this curriculum. BLM and police brutality is a political issue with many sides. You are proposing propaganda and to teach only one side. The state will not form my children's political views. Absolutely ridiculous. Put your effort into getting kids back into the classroom. Sincerely, Rosemary Matos Sent from my iPhone
