As a Jewish teacher in California since 1983, I continue to hear anti-Jewish comments from my students. A student recently asked me why Jewish people drink the blood of Christian children. I told my student that Jewish people do not consume blood. My student didn't believe me. He said that he read about Jewish blood drinkers on the internet, so it has to be true. As a Jewish educator in the public schools, I know first hand that anti-Jewish myths are believed to be true; they perpetuate anti-Jewish sentiment, and anti-Jewish behavior. This may be why armed guards are have been hired to protect us when we pray at our synagogues. Anti-Jewish sentiment continues to grow in California. It makes sense to include a strong educational unit on preventing anti-Jewish sentiment. Please help prevent the spread of anti-Jewish hatred. Thank you, Mr. Carl Bendroff.
