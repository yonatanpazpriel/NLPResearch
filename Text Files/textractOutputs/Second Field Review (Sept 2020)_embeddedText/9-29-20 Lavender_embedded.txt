From: Steve Lavender Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 12:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Removal of bias relative to Jewish Americans
I do understand the tendency to equate Jewish ethnicity with approval and support for Israel above all else. I believe this is a disservice to the fair understanding of what it means to be Jewish in the 21st century United States of America. As a result, I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by
1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and
inclusive Jewish narrative 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of
discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS. If you want to discuss Israel and BDS, I believe that is a topic more properly discussed in a wide ranging curriculum discussing human rights in the middle east, and not one concerned with the history and treatment of ethnic minorities.
