From: Gayle Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 3:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Spreading hatred via public schools
Your views in appendix A of your new text book, spreads the sort of hatred, I'm guessing you want to avoid, around. This creates a vicious cycle of racisism and hate and does absolutely NOTHING to end it. You need to REMOVE this odious and vile part of your new text book. If you do not, YOU ARE CONTINUING TO TEACH YOUNG MINDS HATRED.
Sincerely,
Gayle L. Dancer-Wysocki
