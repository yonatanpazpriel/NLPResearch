I made a mistake when I said that the Black Muslim woman in this video did not do anything illegal. Her words were not illegal although there is a a likelihood that even her words could be considered "fighting words." However, without question her physical actions were illegal. She knocked the phones out of the hands of two people. This is illegal as I learned when I was told that the man who took the marking pen out of my pocket is considered assault. When Dean Montiero refused to give me the name of the man who took the pen out of my pocket he was violating his duty so that I could not make a complaint against the perpetrator. What is interesting is that there was a subway patrolman present who did nothing but stand there. He should have arrested the woman. Of course there is no evidence that he knew about the physical assaults which included the black woman scratching and drawing blood from the face of the Israeli woman. But the Israeli woman should have made a complaint to him there when there were witnesses to corroborate her story. It is important to know your rights, and they don't include taking the law into your own hands. The law is there to protect us so that we don't have to do this. Or at least it should be.

This Black Muslim woman did not commit a crime because as a private citizen she has the right to speak her mind however vile her statements may be. However, when a public sector employee expresses this kind of discrimination that is against the law. The most important thing this Israeli woman did was to video tape her, and put her diatribe on social media. This was an act of educating the public about an ideology that promotes and sanctifies murderous hatred of Jews.
