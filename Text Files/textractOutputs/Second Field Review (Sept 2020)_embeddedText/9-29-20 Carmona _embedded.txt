Hello:
No doubt you've been hearing a lot of concerned voices regarding the anti-Semitic tone in the recent ethnic studies drafts. My understanding is that Israel is referred to as an apartheid state, but there is no mention of the horrific subjugation and abuse of women in other countries/cultures. Also, it seems that there is no condemnation of antiSemitism, but "Islamaphobia" is brought up as negative and harmful, which of course it is.
It is my understanding that Jewish immigrants are not depicted as a contributing immigrant group to American culture in the same way that Irish, Italian, Hispanic, Asian and other ethnic immigrants are. Also, during the civil rights movement, many Jews stood in solidarity with, and marched alongside with, African Americans in their fight for equality--shouldn't this be brought to light? It is important especially now, when for some reason some celebrities seem to be spewing some sort of rhetoric blaming followers of the Jewish faith for trying suppress or hinder Black social progress in America.
The Jewish faith exists in every culture and country, including Latin nations and Ethiopia. The "enemies" In American culture today are any individual or group that espouses hatred or dissent. Indoctrinating school children to believe that a particular group is "bad," either through implication, direct accusation, or omission is undermining the goal of a tolerant, inclusive society--that is the goal, isn't it? Swaying opinions about foreign policy and international politics are not what the educational study of ethics journeys in America is supposed to be about.
Thank you
