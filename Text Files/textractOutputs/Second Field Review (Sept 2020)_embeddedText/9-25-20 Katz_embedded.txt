From: [email redacted] Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2020 9:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Judaism in the Ethnic Studies Model!!!
As a former lecturer at SFSU the spread of on campus anti-Semitism is moving forward at an alarming rate. To not include the struggles of the Jewish people and The Holocaust is sickening and injurious. Prejudice at its worst.
