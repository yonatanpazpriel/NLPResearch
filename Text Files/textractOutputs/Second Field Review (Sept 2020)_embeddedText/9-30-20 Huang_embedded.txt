Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
As a Chinese-American student who grew up in California public schools, I never saw myself reflected in our textbooks, even though Chinese immigrants have been contributing to the growth and development of the United States for centuries. It wasn't until my 12th grade English teacher, Mr. Litten, encouraged me to do my senior thesis on Asian-American authors that I saw people who looked like me reflected as full-developed characters, and I suddenly had language for my identity as an Asian-American youth. This spark of understanding grew and developed as I moved onto UC Berkeley and started studying AsianAmerican history. Understanding topics such as the myth of the model minority or the perpetual foreigner syndrome, has helped me identify and stand up against of racist acts against Asians and AsianAmericans, from micro-aggressions to violent assaults. Today, more than ever, we have seen a rise in racist incidents and legislation against Asians and Asian-Americans, and we need proactive education in Ethnic Studies to help educate not only Asian-American students but all our students.
In education, we talk about mirrors and windows for students - a mirror is a story that reflects your own culture and helps you build your identity. A window is a resource that offers you a view into someone else's experience. It is critical to understand that students cannot truly learn about themselves unless they learn about others as well. This is why multicultural education is so important - I saw this myself as a student and I recognize it now as a school board member.
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a panethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: - Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community - Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely, Livia Huang
