Dear CDE, I would like to thank you for listening to my community's concerns voiced last August and for considering the concerns we still have after the revisions. While a lot of progress has been made, I am genuinely worried about the lack of transparency that has surrounded the addition of an Arab-American sample lesson, as this chapter was heavily flawed in the first draft. The BDS movement harms minority groups in American and advocates for a foreign conflict that falls outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses in the U.S. If any reference at all, whether within the curriculum or citations, were to be made, the ESMC would ultimately be promoting hate and discrimination through the mention of this hateful movement. Further, I ask that you please reconsider the chapter on Jewish Americans as it is erases the discrimination experienced by Jews and replaces it with this notion of racial privilege, further fueling antisemitism. With the power vested in the CDE I ask that you act on your responsibility to give an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps. Thank you
