I am very concerned about the recently released second draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) in July 2020.
It Ignored the protocols meant to guarantee public transparency, and on the evening of August 12, the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum.
Unfortunately, the antisemitic and anti-Israel bias in the 2019 draft was found in a lesson plan on Arab Americans.
As a follow-up to the IQC request for public comment on this second draft, I am expressing my support of the ADL call for a lesson plan on Jewish Americans and inclusion of a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry.
Specifically, the ADL noted the need for:
1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
2. An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
3. Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism.
4. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
As a concerned, Jewish California resident, I hope that the IQC will do what's right and comply with the ADL recommendations.
It is critical that our children get a proper perspective from the planned ESMC.
Remember, all live matter.
