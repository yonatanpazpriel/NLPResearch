From: Jan Daisher Sent: Wednesday, September 2, 2020 3:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Spelling errors
Hello!
The Model Curriculum Preface Line 99 - The word "Course" is spelled wrong. It needs the R added.
Line 116 - the word is either hyphenated "social-emotional" development, or separated into 3 words: social emotional development The first part "socio" listed in the document refers to economic status, and is generally paired with socio-economic. I think you want "social" related to development
Chapter 1 Line 39 and Line 157 - Same issue with the word socio-emotional learning, which I believe should be social-emotional learning.
The content is great! I will take time this week to go through the other chapters. It's a busy day here, so I only had time for these 2 sections today.
Thank you for all your hard work on this! Jan -Jan Daisher Director, Special Programs and Professional Development William S. Hart Union High School District
