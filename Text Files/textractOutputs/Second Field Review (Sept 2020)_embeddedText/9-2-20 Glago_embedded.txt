Dear CDE,
I would like to address the Arab-American sample lesson in the ESMC. Particularly since the BDS movement falls outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses in the U.S.
This copied section below (Please disregard the yellow highlighting in the photo) states the following INCORRECT and FALSE information about the BDS movement:
1. The BDS movement is not about establishing freedom for Palestinians. If it were, it would want to establish freedom FOR ALL PALESTINIANS, not just those in Israel. Currently the BDS movement is more about fighting Israel's legitimacy than it is about freedom for Palestinians, who suffer much worse conditions in MOST of the Arab countries than they do under Israeli relatively benign occupation.
2. Regarding complying with International Law, Israel"s occupation IS in compliance with International Law. There is absolutely no international court which has found otherwise. On the contrary, those international courts which have dealt with this issue, have found Israel to be in compliance. Just because the U.N. General Assembly - which is NOT a court of law - decrees something, does not make it true.
3. Many, many countries, including the United States, maintain their minority populations in FAR WORSE conditions than the Palestinians under Israel's control. Not that this is justification for anything, but you would be as obliged to call this out if you were going to call out Israel for these alleged transgressions.
I ask that you act on your responsibility to give an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps.
Thank you
