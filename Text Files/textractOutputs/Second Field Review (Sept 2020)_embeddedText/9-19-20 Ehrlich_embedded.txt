My suggestion is to start with the 3 R's, work in physical safety of the students on campus, reduce overcrowding in the classrooms, teach basic human decency, wrangle the bureaucrats who are getting paid for making no impact on the students and make the public schools worthy of the taxes collected purportedly for their benefit. Then, once all the existing problems are solved, turn your attention to this flight of fancy. Frankly, this entire "new idea" can be taught by simply reading Dr. King's I have a dream speech ("children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character"). Isn't that what we are seeking from our citizenry?
Dear IQC Representatives, I am joining the numerous calls for continued improvement of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Your removal of negative content from the initial draft and the acknowledgement that anti-Semitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians there must be a renewed commitment to transparency in every step of this curriculum's creation, added safeguards to what can be taught in this curriculum, and have more inclusive representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community. 1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel ï¿½ including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing the ESMC Thank you for the consideration. Sincerely disappointed and overburdened (and soon to be former) California Taxpayer,
