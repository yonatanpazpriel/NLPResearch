Dear CDE,
You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools.
