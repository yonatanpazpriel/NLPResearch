Lesson Purpose and Overview
Students creating their own K-Pop video will provide an opportunity to understand the impact of K-Pop as well as expose students to Korean pop culture and its global influence. It will stimulate students' interest in Korean culture through a medium that is part of their daily lives.
Lesson Objectives

Students will collaborate to recreate K-Pop videos of their choice, analyze the lyrics, styling, fashions, dance, music and the cinematography used in making K-Pop music videos to gain an understanding of modern Korean popular culture and the entertainment world thereof.
Essential Questions
1. What is it about K-Pop that has exploded in popularity across the globe? Let's seek to gain some insight to why there are such huge international fanbase all over the world. We will attempt to do this by walking in their footsteps (or dance steps!)
2. What is or was your first impression of K-Pop? What are some similarities and differences of K-Pop in comparison to American popular music?
Lesson Steps/Activities
1. The teacher will take a poll of the students to get a quick visual assessment of how much prior knowledge students have of K-Pop. Ask "Show me by holding up your fingers from 1-5, 1 being you know close to nothing, to 5 being you are a diehard fan and have attended concerts or know when the next new hottest K-Pop group's song will drop on You Tube". Take mental note, then show some samples of current popular songs. (Refer to Materials and Resources below for online references and links for how to find these sources)
2. Students will be placed into groups of 4-5 and make a selection of a K-Pop music video of their choice to recreate, and get it approved by the teacher for appropriate content and lyrics. They will work off of two video sources: one, the official video and another one that provides the Korean lyrics, English romanization and translation all simultaneously line-by-line while highlighting the photo of the K-Pop idol who is singing the specific parts. (Refer to Materials and Resources for these links) They will then decide who will be filmed for which portions of the song and

prepare their parts to do any combination of lip sync, dance, or act out the content of the song in an artistic and creative way.
3. Students will observe and take note of the wardrobe, hairstyle, make-up, dance moves, video angles, and scenery and background choices used in the original official music video and use the information to guide their remake. They will be given the freedom to make it as close to the original as they can or they may interpret using their own twist, simplify dance moves, and decrease the number of video frames and changes of scenery as needed to make it less overwhelming. It can even be done as a parody as long as it is done in good taste and not in a disrespectful manner. Pay attention to see that your version and interpretation of the video is in line with communicating the meaning of the song and keeps within the overall theme.
4. Students will be given 3-4 weeks' timeline for planning and rehearsals to either meet with their groups outside of class time and/or be given group time during class. They will schedule video shooting days and prepare and bring any props and costumes to make recording on campus possible or meet at a student's house with parental support.
Assessment, Application and Reflection
1. Having analyzed the original music video and producing your own, what is the message of the song and what does it teach you about the values, interest or concerns of contemporary Korea? Is it something that you can relate to? Give examples and explain.
2. Having looked closely at the dress/costuming of the members, were you able to find similar clothing items from your closet to emulate the style of the member you took on? What seems to be the influence of their fashion?

3. Has your interest been piqued? Who's your "Bias"? (This question in K-Pop means they are asking you who your favorite member of an idol group is.)
Want to know more about the member(s) of the K-Pop group you made a cover music video of? Here's an example of a site where you can go and obtain detailed information on your "Bias.": K Profiles https://kprofiles.com/rap-monster-facts/
Material and Resources
1. For most popular and recent K-Pop videos, simply search Youtube by keywords such as "KPOP 2020" or "Most Popular KPOP". Review them prior to showing students for content, appropriate lyrics and visuals.
2. Example of the two music videos the students will need to work off side by side for K-Pop with Korean lyrics:
Original official video: BTS, (Boy With Luv) (feat. Halsey)' Official MV YouTube, https://youtu.be/XsX3ATc3FbA
Boy With Luv - BTS ft. Halsey (Han/Rom/Eng) https://youtu.be/oio-gilD57c These kinds of YouTube channels have a wealth of popular K-Pop playlist libraries which makes it possible for non-Korean speakers to understand the song and even sing along with the romanization of the lyrics.
