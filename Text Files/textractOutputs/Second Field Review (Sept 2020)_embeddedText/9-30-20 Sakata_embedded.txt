I am an 82-year old sansei woman of Japanese descent born in California. My 3-generation family experienced three years of incarceration in a Colorado camp before returning to the California town where my mother, aunts, sister and I were born. The Japanese American camp experience and their lives in California are deeply embedded in my identity today and equally, should be remembered as part of California/US history. The teaching of history is not only to glorify the past, but also to teach younger generations lessons learned from the past. It is important that the Japanese American experience be kept/included in the California Department of Education Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely, Hiromi Lorraine Sakata UCLA Professor Emerita Department of Ethnomusicology
