Dear Committee on Ethnic Studies,
I am a California middle school social studies and ELD teacher of 35 years, and I have grandchildren in California schools. The current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum needs to be revised for the following reasons:
1. Activities in this curriculum emphasize "white "dominant "culture" while disregarding the diversity among whites. It promotes racism instead of tolerance and advances anti white attitudes.
2. This draft promotes BDS, a one sided anti Israel movement, and some lessons encourage an antiJewish bias. It also ignores diversity among Jews.
3. This curriculum emphasizes some ethnic groups while excluding others.
4. The Guiding Values and Principles permit limited approaches to study ethnicities, a strategy that is in conflict with the California History-Social Science Framework.
Our students deserve to study ethnic groups factually and in a way that promotes understanding and appreciation of other cultures. This draft promotes divisiveness, racism, and victimization.
