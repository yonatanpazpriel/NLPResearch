Dear Instructional Quality Commission,
Thank you for your time and dedication to this very important and much needed work. In reviewing the sample lessons and topics, it occurred to me that there is an absence in the representation of Arab American studies. Sample lessons should be called out separately and included perhaps as an additional subgroup titled "Arab American Studies" to begin on page 67. Sample Lessons could include the following:
� Historical and Contemporary Experiences of Arab Americans � Arab Immigrant and Refugee Experiences � Additional Sample Topics
With the growing number of immigrants and refugees in California from the Arab region, it is critical to include this subgroup in the ethnic studies curriculum. The data (see attached) from CDE's Dataquest show a significant increase in the presence of the Arab subgroup, hence making it a critical component to the new ethnic studies curriculum content. According to CDE's Dataquest, Arabic is the 4th largest home-language spoken among California's English Learners. In the past 10 years, there has been a 232.4% increase of Arabic speaking students, a 201.1% increase of Chaldean speaking students, and a 77.4% increase of Farsi speaking students in San Diego County. These statistics cannot be ignored. It will be a tremendous disservice to California students not to study this population through ethnic studies curriculum offered by such a forward-thinking state. It will be my pleasure to help develop this content to ensure that the ethnicities of our current demographics are represented in the curriculum.
Please feel free to reach out to me via email as needed.
