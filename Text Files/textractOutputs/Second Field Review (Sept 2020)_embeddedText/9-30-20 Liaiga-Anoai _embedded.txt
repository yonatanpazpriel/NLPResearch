Greetings & Talofa,
As a Pacific Islander community, we are grateful to have had the opportunity to meet with Superintendent Thurmond and members of the CDE team.
We appreciate his commitment of the Pacific Islander Ethnic Studies Curriculum model that was initially submitted in August in its entirety and we hope that we can count on the support of IQC and State Board of Education to also support our request to ensure that the curriculum is approved and implemented in its authentic form.
As one of the four Pacific Islander elected School Board Members, I along with my Jefferson Elementary School District Board colleagues continue to advocate for Ethnic studies from all communities. We advocate for our classrooms to provide this unique opportunities that create pathways of pride and instill a whole new level of community ownership and engagement.
As the founder of Camp Unity, since 2011 we have served 8,000 youth during our summers and year round programs based on Pacific Islander culture and history. Our students come from diverse ethnic backgrounds and our ability to provide an inclusive platform continues to be appreciated by the communities we are in.
Ethnic Studies works and it is a vital part of learning which also combats the system racism and social unrest that has plagued our educational institutions for far too long.
It is my hope as a proud product of public education that you will listen not only as community leaders, but as investors in equitable approaches that can have life changing impact.
Thank you for your time and I remain faithful that we can celebrate positive outcomes together.
I lend my voice and my communities we are but a phone call away.
In the spirt of service,
