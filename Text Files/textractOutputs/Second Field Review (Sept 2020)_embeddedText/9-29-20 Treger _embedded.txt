From: Paul Treger Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 3:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum
I am communicating to encourage an unbiased and factual curriculum that has no political bias. Therefore I encourage the ethnic studies curriculum to include current definitions of Anti-Semitism, historically correct information about the Jewish diaspora, and the Holocaust. Most importantly, the curriculum should avoid pressure from anti Israeli divestment organizations. I have no objection to the recent addition of adding Arab-Americans the the study, but keep out Anti Israeli rhetoric. Sincerely, Paul Treger M.D.
