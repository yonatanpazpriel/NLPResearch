Hello,
I am writing to share that I don't agree with this curriculum and find portions of it perpetuating antisemitism. Please edit to be inclusive of all people, including Jews.
With rising violence against Jews in the United States, the fact that some of the curriculum opens doors to anti-Zionism, BDS, and one-sided anti-Israel narratives Is concerning, to say the least.
I urge you to consider the vast and recent history of antisemitism in the US and make appropriate changes as the ESMC relates to Jewish studies.
Thank you, Keren de Zwart -Keren de Zwart
