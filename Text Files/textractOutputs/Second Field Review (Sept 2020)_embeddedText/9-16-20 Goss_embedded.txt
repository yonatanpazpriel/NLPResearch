From: Jeff Goss Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 6:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ethnic studies program
To whom it may concern We implore you to ensure anti-Semitic and anti-BDS language is kept out of the proposed ethnics studies curriculum. It would be shameful to add salt on the wounds to the current round of anti-Semitic hate Facing the Jewish people.
Please help us keep more hate out of the current environment.
