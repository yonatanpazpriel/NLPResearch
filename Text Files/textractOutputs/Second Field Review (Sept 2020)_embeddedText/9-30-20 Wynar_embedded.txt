Please consider adding a lesson plan on Jewish Americans and a definition of antisemitism, an ism that has persisted for many, many years. Future generations need to be aware of how hate against a marginalized group can lead to horrific disasters such as the Holocaust.
Thank you for your consideration, Melinda Wynar
