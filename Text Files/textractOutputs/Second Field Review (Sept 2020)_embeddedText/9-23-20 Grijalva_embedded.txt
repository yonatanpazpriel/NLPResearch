Hello,
As an educator, I am totally against this curriculum that does nothing to educate the students on the history of our GREAT country!! Our students need to learn about our founding fathers and others that helped build up this country. Can we include other great figures like Cesar Chavez, and other multicultural figures? Yes definitey but this curriculum that they are currently trying to pass just tears down America!! We need to lift up America and show the students that the reason so many want to immigrate to our great country isn't because of all the problems. It is because in AMERICA you have the opportunity to succeed if you try your best, go to school, and work hard!!
Do not pass and implement California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) into our public schools. Many students are already leaving to charter schools and with this public schools will soon be extinct!!
Thank you for listening to my concerns, Jenny Grijalva
