From: lisa tsukamoto Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Karen Kai Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE JAPANESE AMERICAN HISTORY IN THE CALIFORNIA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM!
Dear Staff of the CDE,
My name is Lisa Tsukamoto and I am a veteran teacher in the San Francisco Unified School District and a proud graduate of public schools. I am extremely disappointed to learn that Japanese American history is not being included in the California ethnic studies curriculum. Excluding it would be a grave mistake. California students need to learn about the injustice of incarceration during WWII and how violations of human/civil liberties and social injustices continue here as we witness what is happening today.
Respectfully,
Lisa Tsukamoto
