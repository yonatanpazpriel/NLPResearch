My name is Kate Chavez and I am a Hispanic Jew. I was born and raised in Los Angeles, attended a LAUSD school, and I am a proud product of the California State University system. I am currently an educator and work with an organization that combats antisemitism. Every year, we ask our students if they face antisemitism in their communities, and every year, over 90% of the teens have experienced antisemitism. Education is the first step in eradicating hate and the curriculum has a very important job.
I urge you to revise the ESMC to:
1. Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism in all its forms. 2. Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA. 3. Remove "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
In order to make these changes, I urge you to follow the specific recommendations made here:
