From: Lynn Schworetzky Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 9:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Requirement
I was dismayed to read about the proposed ethnic studies requirement for high school graduation. At a time of such divisiveness in the state and the country, is it a good idea to promote our differences instead of build upon what we share in common. Do we want to promote the balkanization of California?
It is a fine idea to expose our students to different cultures and backgrounds. It is wrong to use a high school requirement to indoctrinate rather than educate. Any program proposed by the state is sure to be subject to political lobbying from one group or another. That appears to be the case here.
Please do not subject our students to required, biased training.
