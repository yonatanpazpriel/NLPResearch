To Whom It May Concern,
I would like to urge you to reject the proposed curriculum in AB331. This proposal only creates division and sows hatred. The antisemitic undertone implicit and explicit within this proposal should not be tolerated nor adopted by any school board or by any decent educator. This curriculum promotes hate and one-sided narratives against Jews, excludes many other ethnic groups, and promotes divisive political viewpoints.
I am Jewish. I came to this country as a refugee and I am now a proud US Citizen. I am a parent of two children in the public school system. My parents left everything behind in their homeland for a better future for their children. Nothing about my upbringing was privileged, including immigrating to a new country, living in near poverty until my parents were able to establish themselves, and working odds and ends jobs to put myself through college and graduate school.
I teach the importance of hard work, perseverance, tolerance, and gratitude to my children. I also teach them about their heritage. Jewish people have endured generations of persecution, pogroms, and discrimination. To teach otherwise, would an affront to reality and an absurd lie. This effort to exclude minorities who have endured racism is a racist act in itself.
I appreciate your understanding and in supporting an inclusive and truly educational curriculum, free of political bias and targeted ethnic scapegoating.
Kind Regards,
