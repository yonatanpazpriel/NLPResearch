From: Deborah Hoffman Sent: Saturday, September 26, 2020 5:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not exclude the CA Jewish community from the new Ethnic Studies curriculum!
Dear Sirs/Mesdames:
It is highly commendable that the CA educational curriculum is set to include a more robust ethnic studies program going forward. As such, it is essential that children learn the extent to which an unfortunate number of ethnic communities have been and continue to be discriminated against in the United States. Sadly, these communities include that of the Jewish people. Whether religious or not, individuals born Jewish have been the subjects of hate crimes and negative propaganda throughout history - from ancient history to recent U.S./CA history. And today, white supremacists continue to target hate crimes against any number of ethnic persons, especially and including African Americans and Jewish Americans.
In sum, Jews are one of the most targeted communities for hate in the United States and excluding them erases the critical role that antisemitism plays in white supremacy. If the curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians, it must be truly inclusive, and that includes representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the diversity within the Californian Jewish community.
Thank you for your kind attention to this serious issue.
Sincerely,
Deborah S. Hoffman
