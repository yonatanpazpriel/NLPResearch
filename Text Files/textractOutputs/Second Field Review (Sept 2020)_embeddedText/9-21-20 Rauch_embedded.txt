From: Rauch, James Sent: Monday, September 21, 2020 10:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] why Arab Americans belong in the Ethnic Studies curriculum
Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic Studies team:
There are about 400,000 Arab Americans in California, about one percent of our population. No one knows the numbers exactly because the Census counts Arab Americans as white. Yet Arab Americans certainly do not benefit from white privilege. Arab Americans are subjected to constant surveillance as potential "terrorists," are removed from flights, and are given extra screenings at borders. Arab Aerican citizens are told to "go home." Both Arab American and non-Arab American youth need the knowledge of Arab American history and contributions provided by an Ethnic Studies curriculum to counteract the negative stereotypes pervasive in our culture.
Sincerely,
James Rauch Professor of Economics UCSD
