From: Robert H. COLE Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 5:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Model Curriculum
Dear CDE, The recent history of Ethnic Studies and Middle Eastern Studies departments in universities makes clear that these fields are very susceptible to politicization. To avoid this, I urge the following: Transparency and consistency in the process of considering this Model Curriculum. A lesson on antisemitism including the U.S. State Department definition, which is fair and realistically recognizes that anti-Israel and anti-Zionism positions can be so extreme as to become antisemitic. A lesson on American Jews in all their diversity. Inclusion of American Jews of Middle Eastern decent in any lesson on Americans of Middle Eastern decent. Explicit recognition of the dangers of politicization in the classroom in ethnic studies courses, which violates students' academic freedom. There should be clear effective guidelines to avoid politicization, a truly confidential process for students to complain, and professional outside audit of courses.
Thank you for considering these commets. Robert H. Cole
