Good day. I am writing to encourage further inclusion of Jewish Americans in the ESMC. As a teacher and former professor of teacher education, I am well aware of the whitewashing of curriculum and its repercussions. In Eastern Europe, for example, students are largely or wholly unaware of the Holocaust that occurred on their front porch and clueless about the collaboration with Nazis that occurred in their countries. As a Jew, I have found that, despite a mostly racist-free upbringing, I am seeing more and more incidents of antisemitism, including 2 at the educational institution at which I worked last year and a serious one at my previous institution. If we are going to have curriculum that seeks to create a more tolerant and supportive society, we must provide adequate information and opportunities for students to understand the Jewish-American community, including diversity within our community, our political and social positions in support of diversity of people of all groups, and the diversity within our community with reference to Israel, We, too, are subject to discrimination and face it regularly. If this is to change, we need to be included adequately in the curriculum. I fully support the position of the Anti-Defamation League in requesting appropriate coverage for Jewish Americans in the ESMC. Thank you.
