From: Heidi Monkarsh Sent: Monday, September 14, 2020 10:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Request for ESMC
Dear IQC Representatives, I am joining the numerous calls for continued improvement of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Your removal of negative content from the initial draft and the acknowledgement that anti-Semitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians there must be a renewed commitment to transparency in every step of this curriculum's creation, added safeguards to what can be taught in this curriculum, and have more inclusive representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community. That is why I am requesting for the following FOUR requests of the ESMC: 1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel, including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Re-commit to transparency and the pre-determined process of writing the ESMC Thank you for the consideration. Sincerely California Residents,
Heidi and Jon Monkarsh
