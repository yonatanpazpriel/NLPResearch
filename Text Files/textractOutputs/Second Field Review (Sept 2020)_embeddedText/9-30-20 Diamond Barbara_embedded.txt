From: B Diamond Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 5:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC comment...
1. Regarding ESMC... 2. I strongly submit that Jewish Americans should be recognized in an individual lesson plan,
as well as be mentioned in the lesson plan on Arab Americans. Also, please
include antisemitism in the curriculum and correctly define "antisemitism" as stated in Webster dictionary or the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which was adopted by the US State Department in 2010. The word "antisemitism has been used with the same meaning since the 1800's. 3. Please, in all phases of development of ESMC, there must be transparency and opportunity for public comment. 4. Thank you, 5. Barbara Diamond
