It's critical to include Jews in the new ethnic studies curriculum. They are an ethnic minority who are very often misunderstood, which I've seen firsthand.
Having just retired as a teacher in the San Francisco Unified School District, I can tell you I've heard students say egregious things about Jews. For example, from a caucasion boy I heard "I hate Jews!." From a Yemeni girl I heard "I can't go back to Yemen because the Jews are killing women and children."
These disturbing statements show that way more education is needed for California young people. Thank you, Lori Barak
