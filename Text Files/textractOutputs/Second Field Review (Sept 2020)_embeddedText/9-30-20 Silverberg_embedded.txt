Hi, my name is Carol Silverberg and while I live in Austin, Tx, my husband and I also own a vacation home in San Diego, Ca. It has come to my attention that followers of the BDS movement are trying to influence proposed curriculum for California public schools. This does not surprise me as I have seen this effort in Texas as well. Specifically, I served on the board of a nonprofit organization that was involved in student affairs at the University of Texas. We understand the anti-Semitic intent of the BDS movement and how its fight against Israel is also a fight against American multicultural diversity, and specifically, targets and discriminates against the American Jewish community.
I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by 1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and
inclusive Jewish narrative 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of
discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS. Thank you for taking the time to read my email and consider my concerns. Sincerely, Carol Silverberg
