Please insure a lesson plan on anti-semitism, on the diversity of American Jewish groups, and insure opportunities for public comment at every stage of the development of the ethnic studies content. Do not permit the creep of anti-semitism into the lessons on other ethnic (Arabic) groups. Thank you.
