From: Greg Cohen Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 5:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] feedback on california ethnic studies model curriculum
I wanted to offer feedback that ethnic studies model curriculum take a more balanced and inclusive approach of anti-semitism which predates this nation and continues to impact Jewish communities in the US. The ADL tracks hate crimes and they are and have been on the rise.
I request that the curriculum:
1. Includes a meaningful definition of antisemitism. 2. Keeping derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel out of the curriculum. 3. Have policies in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future. 4. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish
Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color. 5. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
Thank you,
