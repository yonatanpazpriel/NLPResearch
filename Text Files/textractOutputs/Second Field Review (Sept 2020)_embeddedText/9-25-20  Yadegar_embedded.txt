To Whom it May Concern, As an immigrant mother of 4, I am deeply concerned and worried about the proposed curriculum. This is hateful and misleading. We must focus on inlcusion and diversity. Antisemitism and anti Israel education is wrong and racist. I urge you to revise the curriculum to accurately represent Jewish Experiences. I would also urge you to add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submited by JIMENA.
Thank you for your time.
