In the online J which I received today is an interview with President Mahoney in which she doubles down on her claim that the Leila Khaled event comes under the rubric of academic freedom, and the interviewer doesn't address the real issue here which is that giving material support to a US State Department designated terrorist organization is illegal under the Anti-terrorism Act. Material support includes any help which the terrorist would otherwise have to pay for. If the CSU attorneys are unfamiliar with this or have failed to inform her of this law ignorance of the law is no excuse. If President Mahoney goes ahead with this event tomorrow she opens herself and the CSU to criminal charges and penalties. ----- Forwarded Message ----From: J.
