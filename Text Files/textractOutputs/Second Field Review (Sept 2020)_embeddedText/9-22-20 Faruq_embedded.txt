From: Faruq Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 3:48 PM To: IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Public Comment To IQC
Dear IQC Representatives,
I urge you to include anti Semitism, Islamophobia and other forms of hate speech as part of the curriculum. However:
1. Israel is a foreign country that does not require special protection from criticism, or intermediaries to decide what is permissible. I also urge you to not include phrases like "anti Israel" or "pro Israel" or equivalent.
2. Boycotts are an individual right of Americans. There is no reason to single out Israel for special protection against boycotts.
3. Criticism of any foreign country's behavior is our right. Israel is a foreign country. Criticizing Israel's behavior is not anti Semitism!
4. Israel needs special scrutiny at a time when it is dispossessing Palestinians, meddling in our politics, and selling weapons to the government of India which is inspired by the RSS Nazi ideology.
4. Palestinian Americans have an absolute right to speech equality, and the same rights as any other Americans. They have special standing to criticize Israel's behavior towards Palestinians.
Thank you for the consideration.
Sincerely
FA
