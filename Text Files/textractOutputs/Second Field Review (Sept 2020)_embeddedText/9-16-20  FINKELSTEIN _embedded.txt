In this day and age of increasing antisemitism it is unconscionable not to include Jews in the ethnic study program. Jews are not being stigmatized because of their religion, but because of their ethnicity. If you follow a Christian religion and decide to no longer follow it, you are no longer Protestant, Lutheran, Baptist, Catholic, etc. But as we found out in Nazi Germany, if you are born a Jew, you are always a Jew.
