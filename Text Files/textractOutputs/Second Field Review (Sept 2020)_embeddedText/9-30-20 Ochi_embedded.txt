Dear Director/s,
As a retired secondary teacher and a concerned Japanese American, I urge you to include Japanese American History in the ethnic studies curriculum.
The decades-long discrimination against Asian immigrants that led to racist legislation and to the wartime incarceration of upwards of 120,000 men, women and children of Japanese ancestry are critical events in this country's history. Likewise, the grassroots movement for redress and reparations, led, primarily, by Japanese Americans (and supported by diverse religious and racial communities) holds issues and lessons that are tremendously important for today's political environment.
That the U.S. government's Commission on the Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) concluded that the wartime incarceration of Japanese Americans was based on wartime hysteria, race prejudice and failure of political leadership, spurred the redress movement that ultimately won a presidential apology and monetary restitution for over 82,000 former victims of the government's racist policy that was Executive Order 9066.
The lessons of Japanese American wartime incarceration for communities of color in this country is so important. Please, do not let those lessons be lost in the important arena of ethnic studies. Please contact me should you have any questions at all.
Most Sincerely,
/s/ Kay Ochi
