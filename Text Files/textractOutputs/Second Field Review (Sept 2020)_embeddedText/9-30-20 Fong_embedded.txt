Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I understand that the commission has decided to eliminate the module on the history of Japanese internment from the K-12 curriculum. These lessons on the unjust and illegal internment of Japanese American Citizens must be restored. This is particularly important given the current environment of anti Muslim and anti immigrant sentiment perpetrated by the current administration. There are so many lessons to be learned by our past mistakes of bigotry and exclusion that can only be learned by exposing such injustices to the entire school population. The teaching of history should always be prioritized on subjects that teach lasting takeaways, and the Japanese internment experience is history that must be taught so that it is never repeated in our country. There are many other historical subjects that lack such important takeaways. I cant believe that the commission would even consider eliminating such an important lesson for our children.
I strongly recommend that the commission reconsider its decision and add this important piece of history back to the curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely,
Stephen Fong
