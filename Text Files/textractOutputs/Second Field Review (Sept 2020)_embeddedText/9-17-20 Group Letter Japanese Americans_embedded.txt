Dear Tony Thurmond,
It has come to my attention that the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, in regards to the Asian American section, has failed to include a detailed history of the Japanese American community. The current draft of the curriculum outline has reduced the Japanese American experience down to one bullet point on page 91. This is unacceptable. The Japanese American community has been an integral part of California history; from the farmers who made the "unfarmable" land flourish with producer, to the activists who challenged the supreme court against the incarceration of 120,000 people based on their race.
It has also come to my attention that this current outline also leaves out the Vietnamese American, Korean American, and South Asian American groups as well as many others. We are also aware that the first draft of the curriculum had a Pan-Asian studies which covered issues such as the Model Minority Myth. This is critical to our Asian American history, and to leave this section out would be a disservice to the children who don't understand what it means to be Asian American, despite being bullied and attacked by others for being Asian American.
Please reconsider the Asian American curriculum in your Ethnic Studies proposal to be more inclusive of many other groups.
Thank you, Lynne Hanamoto In my 37th year As a Special Educator LAUSD
