"E Pluribus Unum" this is our nation's motto. Out of many one. This ethnic studies curriculum instead seeks to shatter our national fabric. Let me count some of the ways: It states "white privilege" as a truth. Let's exam this: When Ward Connerly was California regent, 19932005, he did away with racial preferences in the California university system. Now it's back on the November ballot in order to be reinstated. When one group is given preference based solely on skin color, it creates resentment in those more qualified but having the wrong skin color.
In your ethnic studies, you include the Nation of Islam. Why? Its leader, Louis Farrakhan, calls Jews, "vermin". dehumanizing us Jews same as Adolf Hitler - and you know how that turned out with at least six million murdered Jews. and speaking of Jews, how come we're not included in the ethnic studies? Does not the murder of Jews praying at a synagogue in Poway, California, warrant inclusion?
The curriculum also includes the Black Panther Party and other black supremest organizations.
You get the point. This curriculum will not heal our nation. Go back to the drawing board or just drop it.
