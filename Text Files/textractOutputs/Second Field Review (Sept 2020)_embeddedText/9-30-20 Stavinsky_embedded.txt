From: Tamara Stavinsky Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 7:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
To the Ethnic Studies Committee and Senator Stern,
As a Jewish American, I am well aware that we need to encourage tolerance and respect for all. I am also well aware that with anti semitism currently at an all time high, we need to be very careful not to fan those damaging flames in our education system.
I, along with thousands of other Californians, respectfully request that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum make the following 4 changes:
1) Teach about anti-Semitism and the Holocuast and that tolerance and acceptance is a must in a civilized society.
2) Include broad Jewish American experiences and include sample lesson(s) that reflect the diversity of Jewish Americans. The American Jewish community has Ashkenazi Jews, Sephardic Jews, Jews with varying religious denominations - orthodox, conservative, reform. There are also African American Jews (some that you might know include singer Drake, Tiffany Haddish, Lisa Bonet, David Blu, Rashida Jones, Maya Rudolph), Jews from China, India, etc. that reside here.
3) Remove anti Semitic language, dispel anti semitic falsehoods and ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement -- is excluded
4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing to the ESMC
Respectfully, Tamara Stavinsky
