Ethnic Studies Lesson Plans: Countering Dominant Narratives
The following lesson plans are a supplement to both ethnic studies and ING's Intercultural Speakers Bureau (ICSB) program that brings a panel of live speakers (in person or via webinar) representing different ethnic and religious groups to the classroom to address the interconnections of the various forms of bigotry they confront and what they are doing to combat it. Trained and certified speakers in the program include members of Black, Asian, Latinx, Indigenous, Middle Eastern, Muslim, Jewish, Sikh, and Hindu American communities.
