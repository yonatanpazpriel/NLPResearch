From: DAVID HOFFMAN Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment Period Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission:
As a member of a religious minority in this state, and as a citizen concerned with the direction this country is going under its current leadership, I am asking that you continue your review of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I speak not only for myself, but for my wife, the daughter of a Holocaust survivor. I speak for the Jewish Americans who, like people of color, bear the brunt of fascist hate language from groups like the KKK and Proud Boys.
I am pleased that your review process has officially acknowledged that antisemitism is a form of hate. But that does not go far enough. The model curriculum needs to provide a meaningful definition of antisemitism. There should be no return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel -- you must provide measures to keep such language out of the classroom. You should provide a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and Northern Africa who were exiled from or had to flee their homelands in the 20th century due to antisemitic and anti-Israel sentiments in their countries of origin. You should provide a sample lesson reflecting the contribution of Jews in the founding and building of our country. Finally, you should commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration.
