To the California Dept. of Education:
I stand with Jews and Israel in requesting that you revise the ESMC. Especially at a time when Anti-Semitism is on the rise and Jews and Synagogues are being targeted, I am appalled that the State of California would remove Anti-Semitism from its curriculum. I am further appalled that the State of California would take sides in a foreign dispute against Israel, a longtime ally of the USA, paving the way for the further spread of AntiSemitism in California and the U.S.
Make the following changes to the ESMC: �Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism �Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded �Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans �Re-commit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing the ESMC
