Hello, I am reaching out to implore that teaching all forms of antisemitism, representing the fully diverse Jewish community and historical accuracy be a curated and included narrative in schools. Comprehensive lesson plans need to be made in teaching fully well rounded history. Education is the first step to becoming an antisemitic America. I hope to see improvements made in the near future.
Best, Laura Wynne
