From: Molly Schneider Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 10:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include anti-semitism
While I support ethnic studies as a California high school requirement, I am deeply troubled that anti-semitism is not adequately defined, included and covered in lesson plans.This is absolutely imperative if you seek to keep bias out of the classroom. Anti-semitism is a serious and dangerous form of bigotry. In addition, please represent Jewish Americans as the diverse community that it is. I fully believe the intentions are good, and with changes, this can be a curriculum and step forward that we can be proud of. Please let me know how I can be included in public comment in the development of a final ESMC. I am an engaged community member in my school district and look forward to transparancy and opportunity to review in the process. Thank you, Molly Schneider
