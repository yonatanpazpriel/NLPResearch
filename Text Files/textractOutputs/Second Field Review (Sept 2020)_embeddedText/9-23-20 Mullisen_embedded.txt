To Whom It May Concern:
I'm a 7th grade teacher at Pasteur Middle School in Orangevale, California. I was recently made aware of some disturbing elements of the ESMC such as anti-capitalism, pro-socialism and pro-Marxism teachings.
In addition, there is a recommendation for students to watch the documentary "Burn, Motherfucker Burn!"
Teachings that come from groups that are in favor of defunding the police and "immediate release and record expungement of all drug related offenses and prostitution" are not appropriate for students in K12 schools.
I strongly believe that people of all colors, races, religion and creed should be respected and treated with fairness and compassion, but parts of this curriculum are inappropriate for K-12 students.
Allow me to quote someone who is familiar with these teachings: "For those of us that grew up in Soviet bloc countries, the ESMC is like deja vu," said Vera Hartford, California lawyer, who was a political refugee from communist Czechoslovakia. "We are dumbfounded by a curriculum that consistently elevates Socialism, Marxism, and Communism as the way students are encouraged to become socially responsible. We are familiar with an educational system that proselytizes this specific political dogma that is proven to be unworkable and discriminatory in itself. It grooms and conditions impressionable minds to an ideology in service of a political agenda. Intolerance, bullying, and loss of freedom inevitably follow."
Thank you for your consideration,
