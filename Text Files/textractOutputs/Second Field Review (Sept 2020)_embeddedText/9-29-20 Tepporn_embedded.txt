RE: Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
As Executive Director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation, I am writing in support of the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a panethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At a minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
Moreover, I would add that:
3. It is an egregious omission to not include mention in any of the lesson plans regarding the important, complex history of the former US Immigration Station at Angel Island -- a National Historic Landmark -in enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Act, the Immigration Act of 1907, the Immigration Act of 1918, and other immigration policies that effectively barred naturalization by people from most Asian and Pacific countries for the latter part of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. I strongly urge you to use our Immigrant Journeys curriculum guide as a resource (www.aiisf.org/curriculum).
Part of Angel Island served as an U.S. immigration station from 1910-1940 and its historic buildings were previously used to interrogate, detain, quarantine, and treat over half a million immigrants from over 80 different countries, particularly those from countries in the Asia/Pacific region. Asian detainees were subjected to more invasive medical exams and more through interrogations compared to their European partners. The Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation is the primary nonprofit partner to CA State Parks in preserving the site's buildings and ensuring that its histories and stories are not forgotten.
In partnership with CA State Parks, private donors, and other community organizations, we have been able to preserve the Immigration Station and transform the site from its designation in 1999 by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places to its

recognition in 2017 as one of America's 11 Most Endangered Historic Places Success Stories. This annual list highlights once-endangered sites "that are now thriving and contributing to their communities--while also focusing attention on the extraordinary efforts undertaken to bring them back from the brink."
Given that the term "Asian and Pacific Islander" encompasses a diverse set of over 50 ethnic communities that speak over 100 different languages, it is even more important that the "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI panethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3.
Care must be taken to not intentionally or unintentionally promote inaccurate narratives that perpetuate misperceptions of our communities as monolithic, as a "model minority" that is universally wealthy and well-educated, or that our communities are "perpetual foreigners" or less American than any other racial/ethnic group.
I strongly urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity, diversity, and meaningful inclusion prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely,
Edward Tepporn Executive Director Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation (415) 658-7691 etepporn@aiisf.org
