From: David Quinn Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:07 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Make the Proposed Curriculum Fully Public
Hello,
Why the secrecy? Make the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum fully public, so that all the people paying for the schools and entrusting their children to the schools can see what is proposed and what their children might be taught there.
Sincerely, Dr. David Quinn
