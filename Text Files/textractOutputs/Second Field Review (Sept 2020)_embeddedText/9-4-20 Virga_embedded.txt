There is no way I will allow my child to be exposed to this manipulated and inaccurate course of action. I will at minimum not allow this to be taught to my child this way. This ideological subversion is part of the problem. This is none of your business, I teach my children right and wrong. Why doesn't the education system focus on a blanket anti-bullying program and teacher reform for those imposing their opinions upon our children. I will at most be happy to participate in a Constitutional law suit against any who try to impose this upon us. There is no way I will allow this to be imposed upon my children. I don't need anyone convincing us that we do anything wrong or that one whole thinking is a problem. I have never seen something so racist and prejudice against as this. Start teaching civics class, home economics, etc. Stop this insulting, overstepping now.
