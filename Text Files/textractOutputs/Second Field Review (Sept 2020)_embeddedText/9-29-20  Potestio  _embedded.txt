From: DENA SUE POTESTIO Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 1:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please heed the voices of and protect the Jewish minority in America!
Dear Members of the California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education:
I urge you to heed the calls of American Jewish groups who are observing anti-Semitic language and anti-Semitic materials - and/or anti-Jewish language and anti-Jewish materials - included in the most recent draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I'm a 2018 and 2019 graduate of Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York, where I also took classes at the nearby Jewish Theological Seminary of America.
I witnessed firsthand the insidious nature of anti-Semitism from the left, while at the same time observing it flagrantly from the right (when a Jewish professor's office at Columbia University was spray-painted with a swastika).
I spoke up in a class at Union Theological Seminary when my professor included a book for discussion that was antiJewish, if not anti-Semitic, but failed to articulate its nature to the class.
I was the lone voice in the classroom because the momentum and fervor within it was anti-Israel.
The experience shook me to my core.
At an event about combatting anti-Semitism in America at the Jewish Theological Seminary around that same time in December 2018, a member of the audience asked the presenters if they were concerned about anti-Semitism coming from the left--from the Academy itself.
The speaker from JTS who is now the seminary's chancellor, Dr. Shuly Rubin Schwartz, commented that she was indeed concerned.
Quoting her:
"Yes, one of the things that is so challenging about the contemporary manifestations of anti-Semitism is that you have them both on the right as well as on the left. And you are describing a kind of anti-Semitism on the left that is, in a way, it's my understanding, simply the latest manifestation of anti-Semitism. Yes, it is now respectable to say, "I'm not anti-Semitic. I'm anti-Israel." But, look, you think about racial theories that were anti-Semitic in the late 19th century, they had the imprimatur of the latest scientific theory. So, the tendency - the impulse - to attach one's bigotry to "science" or to "objective truth," we understand, sadly, that only too well -- that "truth" sadly becomes a relative term.

It is, however, dangerous, pernicious; it has all of the hallmarks of anti-Semitism and I think that it is a willful elision of those terms in order to perpetrate rabid anti-Semitism, in my opinion. That is not to say that there isn't legitimate criticism of what's going on in the State of Israel's political policies, and Jews are hardy critics--some Jews are hardy critics of government actions. But that's very different from what you're describing which is, in my opinion, antiSemitism pure and simple."
Here's the link to the video where Dr. Schwartz made these remarks. Please see the question and quote above at 1:16:23, and a question by a Jewish student about anti-Semitic harassment on the Columbia campus at 1:11:42.

Therefore, please, I beg you, as a matter of understanding history and of having intellectual integrity, heed the voices of this small minority of Americans who are telling you that language and/or materials in the existing curriculum are anti-Jewish and/or anti-Semitic.
They would surely know.
As a recent student myself, as I mentioned above, I've personally experienced the backlash and harm of a misinformed classroom and of a professor who was too quick to use a bigoted and anti-Jewish, if not an outrightly anti-Semitic, author's work as part of the curriculum.
I spoke up - was the sole voice to do so - and was lambasted by the class.
But I would do it again, despite the anguish it caused me.
Please heed the voices of and protect the Jewish minority in America!
Sincerely,
Dena Potestio
