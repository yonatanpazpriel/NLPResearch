Dear IQC: 1. It would appear that a 5th racial/ethnic/cultural group should be added to the curriculum. Clearly Jews have made a significant impact on the American experience. 2. And while the study of bigotry (including anti-Semitism) is included in the curriculum, within the context of a white dominated culture, bigotry within the currently identified 4 groups should also be stressed/examined.
