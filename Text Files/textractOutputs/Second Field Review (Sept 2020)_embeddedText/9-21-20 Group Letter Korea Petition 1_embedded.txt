From: Joey Sent: Friday, September 18, 2020 9:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Korean Americans
September 17, 2020
Dear California Department of Education,
My name is eunju and I am a teacher at thanksgiving korean School I oppose the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in its current form, unless the CDE
incorporates lesson plans on Korean Americans into the draft adopted in November 2020 by the IQC. Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies must be inclusive and equitable.
California recognizes Korean Americans through two resolutions. Hangul Day was passed on October 19, 2019 and recognizes the Korean American community as "an integral part of mainstream American society" that has "made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas." California also recognized Korean American Day on January 13, 2020 by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 142, which declares that "with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans."
I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. Thank you for your consideration
Sincerely yours, Eunju park.
