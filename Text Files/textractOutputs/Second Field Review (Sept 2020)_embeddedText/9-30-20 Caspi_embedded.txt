From: Daniel Caspi Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 6:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Barbara Caspi Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments on ESMC draft to Instructional Quality Commission
I am writing to express my concern about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and would like to make some comments and suggestions. This course is important for all High School students and it is important for them to learn about Jewish Americans and antisemitism. 1) I would like to see an accurate definition of antisemitism included, such as the one in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010 and lessons about antisemitism and its threat. 2) I also think the curriculum should recognize the diversity of the Jewish people that are not only represented by white Europeans (Ashkenazi) or of Spanish descent (Sephardic), but alo of Middle Easter and North African descent. 3) Also there should be transparency and an opportunity for public comment in the development of the ESMC.
Thank you for your attention to my concerns on this grass roots matter.
Sincerely, Barbara Caspi
