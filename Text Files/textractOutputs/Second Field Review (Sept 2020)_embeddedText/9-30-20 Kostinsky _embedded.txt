The one most important message of Ethnic Studies should be Tolerance; it should not be used to indoctrinate hate of certain people or to push political agendas. The ESMC should take advantage of the wealth of materials and teaching assistance available from the Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance that help students to understand the Jewish people , Israel , and harmony among all groups: religious, ethnic, racial, gender, countries of origin, etc. Let's inspire students and touch their hearts and activate their brain cells, not turn them into angry haters.
