Dear Mr. Thurmond,
I am relieved to hear of Governor Newsom's refusal to sign the current draft of the ethnic studies curriculum. While a lot of work went into the curriculum and many changes were made, it still has a ways to go before it is ready.
I repsecrtfully request that the next version have safeguards to prevent one-sided political views, include JewishAmerican middle eastern communities, and teach students about and how to prevent anti-semitism and other forms of bigotry.
I also request that the process in the future will be transparent.
Thank you for your work on this effort.
Sincerely
Amy Idit Solomon Berkeley, CA
