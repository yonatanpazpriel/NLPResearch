Hello,
I have heard that there is a possibility that the history of the Japanese American experience in the U.S. may not be included in an Ethnic Studies Curriculum that is being planned.
I trust this is not true, but if it is, I would urge your department to include the history of Japanese Americans in the Ethnic Studies curriculum.
Although I am not of Japanese ancestry, I would be appalled if the curriculum omitted any of this history.
Thank you,
Warrick Liang
