As an American citizen, a mother, a teacher, a proud Jew, and a strong supporter of the ADL, I wish to express my concern regarding the direction of ethnic studies in California.
It is my strong belief that ESMC needs to include a lesson plan on antisemitism and a comprehensive definition of this enduring and ever-evolving form of hatred. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition and contemporary examples are highlyregarded and I recommend its use. As respected experts, ADL refers to this definition explicitly in our guide Antisemitism Uncovered (https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__antisemitism.adl.org_&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlA-AKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=CvYQfYNWNKYRHApmi4UJavN6ZEfa5ghXQgrLNruH mCo&s=Mx_FNlV1T6kDHYYWAK62pWPOrniSSXwprPbXV0zbg2M&e= ) and more broadly in our resources and lesson plans on antisemitism. Similarly, the U.S. State Department has used this definition since 2010, along with the European Union and others. The ESMC must remain free of the antisemitism and anti-Israel bias that plagued the initial � now abandoned � ESMC draft. Group bias of any sort and gratuitous political indoctrination do not belong in a high school curriculum.
As our world changes it is imperative that our students understand the background of people with whom they may not come into direct contact. I believe that an understanding of and respect for the experiences of Black, Latinx, Asian, Jewish and Arab Americans can only enrich our lives as we work together, play together and live together.
Sincerely, Elaine Feuer-Barton
