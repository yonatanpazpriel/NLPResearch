Dear IQC and SBE Members,
I am a California Jewish high school student/ally supporter.
We deserve an adequate ethnic studies model curriculum that represents our history in the classroom.
We are calling for the curriculum to:
� teach about antisemitism in all its forms. � represent the diversity of the Jewish community. �include a lesson plan about Middle Eastern communities, including Jews.
I am adding my research journal about my Jewish community in Libya. I hope it will show a bit of the huge and complex ethnic diversity the Jewish community enjoy from.
Thank you.
Shai
