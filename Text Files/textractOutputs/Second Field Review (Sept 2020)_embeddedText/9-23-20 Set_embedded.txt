From: Samira Set Sent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 1:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies
To whom this may concern,
From my understanding as the curriculum for ethnic studies - this new curriculum will dismiss the history of the ethnic minorities that have lived in the Middle East and other areas for centuries and who have been ethnically cleansed in some areas.
Please include the history of the Jewish people from the Middle East, North Africa, Ethiopia etc. and please include the history of other religious minorities such as the Kurds, Zoroastrians, Chaldeans, Baha'i, LGBT etc. who have struggled, been killed, mass murdered or hung.
Dismissing this would leave the curriculum with a narrow view of the world, dismiss the various Jewish groups and perpetuate antisemitism and lead to greater ignorance of the Jewish people and their struggles and mass murders and exodus.
Please understand that ALL Jews come from Judea and then spread to the rest of the world where they were slaughtered or kicked out from Europe, North Africa, Ethiopia and throughout the Middle East. Please remember us and our history.
Warmest regards, Samira Setareh
