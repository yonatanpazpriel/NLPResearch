From: Robert Baird Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Tony Thurmond Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Political Agenda from CA Ethnic Studies
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and Governor Gavin Newsom,
I write to you with deep concern about the current draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and to express my support for the detailed revision requests recently sent to you by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.
I firmly believe that rigorous standards of tolerance and respect must be part of any ethnic studies program.
1. NO slander or libel against any minority group. 2. NO political ideology especially that which targets a minority group. 3. NO teaching disrespect or incitement, which leads to hatred or violence. 4. NO participation in curriculum standards by known adversaries of any of the above 3 ethical standards.
Bigoted participants in setting standards for the ethical studies curriculum will eventually corrupt the curriculum in subtle and then in obvious ways. We must prevent bigoted politically ideological people from gaining any foothold in poisoning the minds of students at any level of education. The State of California must create a moral and ethical model for other states and the nation.
If invited and required, I will actively help with standard,
Sincerely, Robert Baird Bob Baird San Jose
