Anti-Zionist propaganda should not be allowed in the school system. I understand that CDE is again allowing a BDS group to influence the classroom. At this time that some Arab countries are striving for peace, it is very counterproductive that the school system allows BDS to influence students. It is a form of antisemitism. That is NOT social justice to all.
