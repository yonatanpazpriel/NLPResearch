From: PJ Hirabayashi Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Inclusion of Japanese American history in ESMC
I am a sansei (3rd generation) Japanese American woman, culture bearer, performing artist, and former Asian American Studies instructor at San Jose State University.
I am writing in support of an inclusive Asian American Pacific Islander unit in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I also underscore the importance of Japanese American history and their contributions to be included.
If their exclusion from the curriculum is a mere oversight or because their historical and social narrative is regarded as insignificant, this is testament to WHY it is critical for the Japanese American experience to be included. California students will learn how history has contemporary relevance--the injustice of incarceration during WWII and how violations of human/civil liberties and social injustices continue here as we witness what is happening today.
