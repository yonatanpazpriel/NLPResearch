Comment
"Pacific Islander Studies initial draft needs to be restored to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Our Pacific Islander Communities should not have to fight so hard to ensure our vibrant culture and rich heritage are included in our California classrooms. We are NOT an afterthought, we are NOT invisible!"
"PI history and stories need to be a part of ethic studies You all love to come and enjoy the islands and our people have fought in Wars along side your parents, sons and daughters. Pacific Islander parents are tax payers and their children deserve to be recognized and served."
"I am Pacific Islander"
"Let's go!!! It's about time we make our mark in our studies and in history."
"This is ESSENTIAL for our Pasefika Youth!"
"It is imperative that Pacific Islander studies are being STUDIED. Although we are a small percentage in population, we have have a rich culture that is embodied with our family roots and cross generations of music, art, dance, language, story telling, social justice and critical knowledge. It is important that we continue in educating ourselves and our allies about Pacific IslandEr history because if we don't, someone will."
"AMERICAS HISTORY & ETHNIC STUDIES NEED TO BE MORE DIVERSE!! SCHOOLS NEED TO START REFLECTING THE STUDENTS TOO!"
"Our personal stories and voices matter in education. Our future generations deserve to see our faces in the classroom setting."
"For My Children and the Future Generations to Come. It's TIME!"
"Pacific Islander studies are essential to us as a people!"
"Our state needs to recognize the rich and unique histories of Pacific Island people and cultures and include it in K-12 curriculum. Too often our territories are left out of American history and majority of Oceania is left out of World history. It's time for our people to flip the narrative, represent and be represented. Check the U. S. Census, we've been in this country for way too long to be disregarded! Support Pacific Island Studies in California K-12!"
"I'm signing because I am a Pacific Islander as well and I would love to see my people more educated and successful in every job opportunity out their for them. I would to see them in politics and also running for governor as well as being a judge or an officer

Comment
whichever that would get my people out there more to help people that look like them is always a plus in my book."
"I was very disheartened to see the that the most recent iteration of the ESMC... It removed histories of Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans and greatly reduced histories of Asian Americans, Central Americans and Native Americans. It is imperative for students to see themselves in history. Please sign (and share) this petition."
"As an American Samoan our history is vital"
"We need this especially for our Pasifika communities"
"Students should learn about all of the beautiful cultures that are here in our country."
"#WeAreOcean"
"Antoinette Charfauros McDaniel"
"PI students need to see themselves in the educational system."
"I'm signing this because I was never taught about myself in school and as a result felt so lost and insignificant. I had no cultural identity of my own because not even my teachers knew about my culture. I'm signing this so that other little PI kids can be proud because they know the history & can fully share the knowledge with others."
"Because my children deserve a piece of their roots taught & shared within the school's curriculum."
"Because PI's are grossly under represented in every single societal conversation."
"Because knowledge SHOULD NOT be a privilege and youth DESERVE to feel seen and heard."
"I am a forensic psychologist of Tongan ethnicity and believe in the importance of learning about our cultures here and abroad. San Mateo County has one the highest populations of Tongans in the world!"
"It is imperative"
"I am of pacific islander descent, and I want my heritage, people, and history to be represented in public education. Especially since the US wrongfully stole Hawaiian land and disenfranchised and erased indigenous Hawaiians. "
"PI curriculum matters!"

"I fully support the inclusion of Pacific Islander studies, voices, history, etc into the CA ESMC. Killisou chapur!"
"Lenna P Malieitulua <a href="mailto:malieitulua@gmail.com" rel="nofollow">malieitulua@gmail.com</a>"
"Pacific Islanders Studies is critical not only for people like me who come from the Islands of the Pacific Ocean but for all people to understand U.S. history and embrace the cultures that make the United States the amazing place we live in."
"It is ridiculous and nasty to neglect the vast community of Pacific Islanders in California! As all the other silenced and marginalized communities know, doing without our histories, our stories, our art and philosophy, only to be forced to study and memorize those from European perspectives leaves only terrible absences and pain."
"Ohana "
"I feel that it is imperative to include voices of the Pacific Islander and Arab community to build on the collective experience of those living in and out of the United States."
"washington petrus"
"I'm a Pacific Islander and have been marginalized in California before. I don't believe there's a worse feeling than this where you don't feel like you belong to the society that claims all people are equal. Having Pacific Studies in California will increase to the full our awareness of the people around us and help them see their place in the world as a people equally dignified in rights!"
"It is important to support Pacific Islander studies"
"I support Pacific Islanders studies"
"Our histories matter."
"I am in solidarity with our Pacific Islander community!"
"All of our community's voices deserve recognition, and Pacific Islander as well as Arab American groups are NOT an exception. Thank you for your continued work to build greater pride, knowledge and understanding amongst our children of diverse backgrounds, histories and perspectives!"
"Ethnic studies is incomplete without Pacific Islander studies!"
"It's time for Education you recognize our people and our contribution to society. We're more than a vacation destination--we're more than bodies on display for entertainment."

Comment
"as a native pacific islander our complex histories and people are not represented in the curriculum. this representation brings validity to our pacific islander youth and their stories/experiences."
"Everyone matters"
"I am a Pacific Islander college student"
"Education and history go hand in hand for a better tomorrow"
"It's important!!"
"Students deserve to learn all of history not part of history"
"Education not incarceration!"
"Critical curriculum for all!"
"REPRESENTATION MATTERS"
"in support of Pacific Islander Studies and Arab American Studies in California schools. Both are important parts in the American cultural mosaic. If left to the mainstream media to learn about Arab Americans, our students will get inaccurate information. In the case of Pacific Islanders, our students will get no education from the mainstream media because there is very little there about them."
"Everyone needs to know themselves included and see that they are -- and have others know about them, too."
"This revision does not stay true to Ethnic Studies!"
"We can't have ethnic studies without Pacific Islanders studied. We live in California and we matter."
"Sheri Heskett"
"Because I stand with ALL minorities! I will NOT stand by the genocide of our history!"
"The City of San Francisco has many Pacific Islanders who are part of the local school district and college student enrollment. These students deserve inclusion in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for the state of Ca. because they are a consistent part of the student population in San Francisco. I also support the inclusion of Arabic American course content in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to serve as a guide fir k-12 Ethnic Studies across this state."
"We need information representative of all people's of all walks but Pacific peoples' histories and lives have been largely washed away by white supremacist education and culture as well as by its colonization."
"I am signing because all histories need to be taught and honored."

"...because it's long overdue..."
"Ethnic studies is all of us"
"Our nation is diverse as should our studies be. Especially in California where Pacific Islanders neighbor our ocean and have influenced our great state."
"Ethnic studies is crucial to uplift BIPOC hxstory, narratives, and truths!!!"
"We are part of California history- represent!"
"WE DESERVE TO BE HEARD!"
"I'm signing because these are super important! Don't erase Pacific Islanders or Arab Americans!"
"Pacific Islander history is crucial to West US history, especially California and the greater Bay Area"

"I support PI studies!!"
"Tongaaaaaa "
"As a member of the Pacific diaspora in the mainland US, I deeply resonate with a feeling of disconnect and misunderstanding of my ancestors. Everything I've learned about my culture was passed down through my family. I never once had the opportunity to learn about my people in a classroom setting throughout my 12 years of school between kindergarten and high school. The only explanation I can assume as to why this is the case is that the public school system in the US does not want to acknowledge the death and destruction that occurred in the Pacific Islands because of colonialism. This act of hiding the truth from any students but particularly Pacific Island students is unjust. We deserve the right to learn about our history in school along with everyone else. Beyond that, we deserve to know the accurate history of colonization that reveals its negative effects, not just a history that celebrates the white men who "discovered" and "progressed" the island nations. It wasn't until I was at an insti"
"It would be ironic to include Ethnic Studies yet exclude certain ethnicities. It would be nice to formally share our history and culture with the world through education."
"Ethnic Studies are vital, as are Pacific Islander and Arab American studies, they need to be included!"
"This is necessary, we must stop overlooking others culture."

"Im signing because there are many PI's like myself who are born and raised in America but know very little about our peoples history."
"I'm signing this because I am of Pacific Islander blood and the issue with the lack of exposure to a certain culture is why many people are misunderstood."
"I support!"
"I want many of my brothers and sisters to know we aren't some type of tourist attraction"
"I'm signing because Pacific Island Studies is all too often subsumed under a too-broad AAPI umbrella, or ignored entirely.The Pacific is a huge place, full of vibrant beautiful cultures, and it deserves just as much attention as any other part of the world."
"PI and Arab studies should absolutely be a part of the curriculum. These ethnic communities are prevalent in the Bay Area. Put a stop to the erasure of their histories. You can't practice diversity and inclusion without acknowledging all of those who are in your classrooms."
"Support 100%"
"it's much needed "
"I was raised in a conservative northern CA city. I'll always remember my 4th grade teacher's reaction when I learned how Hawaii became the 50th state. This wasn't something I learned in public school but it should have been. We didn't even learn about the role Hawaiians played in building Sutter's Fort. Let's change the narrative!"

Comment
"People of Pacific Islander heritage are an important part of California."
"I have family members and friends of Pacific Islands descent. My community has a large population of the same. They deserve to be represented! As do Arab Americans. Mistrust and misunderstanding of others is overcome by education when direct friendships are not facilitated or possible."
"Voice your opinion who ever teach this classes about the Pacific Island and especially Samoa our tradition and culture the right way that count."
"Its important for America to reflect Americans and all of our cultures. Without Pacific Islander Studies I would not be in college."
"My Nana and Tata's history deserves to be taught and remembered. Chamoru and Guahan "Guam" contributions to the U.S. are significant. Our culture should not be erased but celebrated by every American. Preserving and teaching Micronesian history is integral to fairness and visibility. We must teach the truth of American history, and that includes perspectives from CHamorros."
"There is so much we don't know about other cultures, and it's time to learn before they are erased."
"Pacific Islanders have contributed a lot to California, and would be good to hear their contributions."
"terri spicer"
"Pacific Islanders deserve representation in our educational system."
"As an indigenous Chamoru feminist sociologist and Scholar-Activist, Ethnic Studies provided the *one* place in the Academy that allowed me to theorize my family's and my own existence in the diaspora. Moreover, it provided me with the analytic tools to understand how our specific experiences as a colony of the U.S. was necessarily linked to yet distinct from those of Black, Latinx & Asian American communities.I strongly and respectfully urge todus i Taotao Chamoru & todus who truly care about social justice in public education to not only follow but take a strong position in support of including Pacific Islander Studies in the K-12 curriculum.We need MORE, not less, knowledge of our ppl & our struggles to exist in a society we - and i familian-ta - build, sustain, enrich & yes, continue to struggle to be seen in and fight for our rights in day in, day out.Just as importantly, every student, regardless of their background, needs to learn that history too.

"I want people to understand the history of the different Pacific Islander cultures. I want others to know that there are many different people from different islands with customs and traditions all unique to their own communities. But most of all, I want those who have descended from these cultures to understand where they come from, to feel good about who they are and how they fit into this world. I didn't learn much about my culture and traditions until I was well into my adult years, and if I could change anything, it would be to have learned all about where my family came from when I was young. It feels good to know our roots and where we are from."
