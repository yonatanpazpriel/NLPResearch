Hello, I am a parent of a student at Half Moon Bay High School in the Cabrillo Unified School District. I'm writing with concerns about the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and am asking for revision to the ESMC with these key points:
� Add safeguards against promoting one-sided narrow political viewpoints in the classroom; � Include the history and experience of ethnic groups who have been left out of the curriculum,
such as a lesson plan about California's Jewish-American Middle Eastern communities; � Teach students to combat antisemitism and other forms of bigotry; and � Respect the rule of law and adhere to principles of transparency.
Despite some changes to the first draft, many issues remain. Jewish Americans are excluded from the second draft, save passing reference to the Holocaust and a small unit which asks students to write an essay about "the experience of Jewish and Irish Americans gaining white privilege in America." There is no meaningful mention of contemporary antisemitism, no mention that the majority of all religious hate crimes in America are against Jews, nor even a definition of antisemitism despite laying out countless other types of bigotry and bias. More generally, the ESMC is based on a specific movement within ethnic studies - "Critical Ethnic Studies" - which promotes as its educational aim, "radical resistances linked to global liberationist movements."
I am in support of my child - and all California high school students - being exposed to other cultures via ethnic studies. However, this current plan is NOT balanced.
Thank you, Andrew Nemiccolo
