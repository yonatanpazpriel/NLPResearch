To Whom It May Concern,
Thank you for taking the time to update curriculum to the Asian American studies program. Learning more about the history and contributions of Asians will provide a new appreciation of those who contributed to America's growth and enrich the lives of all.
It is quite a task, but I hope you'll consider making sure there is a sampling of a great variety of ancestry included in the scope of the curriculum including Filipinx, Chinese, Pacific Islanders, Hmong, Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, and other Americans in the final lesson plans. It was brought to my attention contributions of some of these groups has been excluded and now is the time to remediate the oversight.
Thank you for all of your hard work and I look forward to seeing what the end result is of your efforts.
Sincerely, Cindy Sakihara
