Hello,
Please find my comments regarding the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft. Specifically, I request the following be part of any final curriculum for students:
1. It should include lesson plans about Jewish Americans that recognize the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, and Mizrachi Jews, as well as Jews of color. Additionally, lesson plans on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent.
2. It should include an accurate definition of antisemitism such as the one developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance that was adopted by the U.S. State Department in 2010.
3. It should include lessons about antisemitism.
These topics are not sufficiently included in the current draft and, on the contrary, the current draft has an antisemitic bias. Any curriculum for CA public schools that is focused on ethnic studies that does not cover the Jewish culture is a weak ethnic studies curriculum. Beyond this, it would be incredibly irresponsible and dangerous to promote any anti-semetic bias to California high school students, especially during these challenging times when antisemetic beliefs and acts are on the rise.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
With Respect,
