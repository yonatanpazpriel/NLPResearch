From: Emeri Handler Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 4:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Constructive Ethnic Studies
I support the requests of the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies which you recently received to remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles" and resulting lessons by:
� Removing the inflammatory "Guiding Values and Principles" which can bring hate and political dogma into the classroom.
� Aligning all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes. � Adding Elements of a Balanced Curriculum for safeguards against
politicizing Ethnic Studies. � Excluding BDS and other one-sided political conversations about Middle
Eastern conflicts. � Including approaches to social change that work within the system to
improve it.
Sincerely,
Emeri S. Handler
