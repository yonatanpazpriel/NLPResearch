From: Jennifer Friedman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Jews in Ethnic Studies
I am a California voter writing to express my emphatic desire to see the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum include Jewish studies. Jews, as an ethnic group, have been the targets of extreme violence and exclusion in California and world wide. In addition, antisemitism is a key component of white supremacy. The Model Curriculum cannot engage in a full discussion of white supremacy without acknowledging anti-semistim. To exclude Jewish studies from the list of groups for study is wrong. It sends a terrible message to Jews nationwide that our experiences are not relevant. And it would be a disservice to the millions of California students learning about tolerance and equity.
I ask that you include Jews the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Thank you for considering my views.
