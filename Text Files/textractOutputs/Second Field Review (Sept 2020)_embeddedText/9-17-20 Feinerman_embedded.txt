Hello,
The overall goal for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is to keep bias out of our classrooms, and as a result, our communities will receive that benefit as well.
This can only be feasible if inclusion of a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry is taught hand-in-hand with the study of Jewish-Americans, in addition to the already proposed histories of African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans.
I urge you to revise this draft to include:
1) A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
2) An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
3) Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism.
4) Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
Sincerely, Stephanie Feinerman
