I'm Ruth Sasaki, a writer and editor of the Topaz Stories Project, capturing memories and stories of Topaz Concentration Camp survivors and their descendants.
I have just heard that Japanese American history has been cut from the most recent version of the Ethnic Studies curriculum, and I was stunned and appalled. Japanese Americans have contributed greatly to this country, and particularly the state of California, and our wartime experiences are an important lesson for students in today's climate, in which race prejudice, politically motivated fanning of anti-immigrant hysteria, and the failure of political leadership are once again targeting people of color. It's a sad repetition of history--a history which is not sufficiently known and understood even WITH courses on our history. By excluding our story from your curriculum, you are erasing us just as California tried to erase us in the 1940s.
Attempts to reduce the Asian American community to a monolithic "model minority" will only lead to misconceptions and stereotyping, and we will continue to be viewed as newcomers from somewhere else who just got off the boat.
Our taxes support your schools; do the right thing and acknowledge us.
