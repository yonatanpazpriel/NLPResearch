Hello,
As a potential teacher of this subject I find it disheartening that no example of a complete course is provided or referenced as an example. My district implemented project lead the way recently and a complete curriculum with day to day activities is proved for each class. You want a truly successful implementation then provide teachers with courses that are "ready to go" that we can build upon.
