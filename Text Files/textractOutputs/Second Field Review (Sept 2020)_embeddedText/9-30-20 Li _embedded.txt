Hi,
My opinion is that the current version is very biased. The school shouldn't be a place to fill in student minds with any political preferences.
Such course is not necessary in k-12 education. Children have already had opportunities to learn history.
Hope you can have a more careful assessment and the best decision.
Thanks. Daisy Li
