Hello!
My name is Natalie and I am a high school student at Mountain View High School in the Bay Area. I am asking you to create a more inclusive Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This means: - teach about all forms of antisemitism - represent the full diversity of the Jewish community - add a comprehensive lesson plan about Middle Eastern communities, including Jews.
I also want to share with you a letter from high school students and allies that over 350 students have signed. Please find it here: https://tinyurl.com/esmcrevisionsletter
Thank you. Natalie Arbatman
