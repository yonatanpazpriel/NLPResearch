From: Selwyn Oskowitz Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 9:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC
We need the following changes related to the ESMC:
1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism
2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded.
Sincerely,
Selwyn Oskowitz MD
