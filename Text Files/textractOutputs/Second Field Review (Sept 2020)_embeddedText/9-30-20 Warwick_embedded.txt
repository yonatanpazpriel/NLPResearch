To whom it may concern:
In the current form, the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum fails to follow Assembly Bill 2016, Chapter 327 of the Statutes of 2016, and Section 51226.7 of the Education Code.
Encouraging understanding of historic bigotry and horrible government actions against Jews world-wide will give current students with ethnic backgrounds a firm foundation of the dangers of bigotry of any kind, just how bad things can get.
According to the Preface of the Model Curriculum, it is supposed to "encourage cultural understanding of how different groups have struggled and worked together, highlighting core ethnic studies concepts such as equality and equity, justice, race[1] and racism[2], ethnicity[3] and bigotry, indigeneity, etc."
But, the Curriculum overlooks one of history's greatest examples, worldwide, which is how Jewish groups have struggled, suffered inequality, inequity, injustice, and bigotry. Jews have been against bigotry, were active in the Civil Rights Movement. Please include this.
1) Please veto the latest draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 2) Please extend the deadlines to develop and approve the curriculum 3) Please add several experts on Anti-Semitism who are sensitive and knowledgeable of Jewish history on the panel 4) Please revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to include a full study of worldwide Anti-Semitism throughout history 5) Include the history of Jews' involvement in the US Civil Rights Movement
Thank you, Jeff Warwick
