It is incredible that Jews are identified as "elite and white privileged" in this curriculum. Jews have endured vilification for many, many years in various countries. To find it happening now, in this country, is heart wrenching.
It should be noted that Jews were in the forefront of battling for the civil rights of our Black citizens, and continue in this effort for Blacks and other minorities.
Please delete this reference regarding Jews from the curriculum.
Sincerely, Mark Felman
