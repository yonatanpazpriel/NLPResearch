From: M Mathis Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 7:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti Semitic content in ethnic studies curriculum
As it stands, the draft curriculum for Ethnic Studies has anti Semitic content included in the Arab studies portion. That is wrong. Jews and people of Jewish heritage should not have to worry about such education in our public schools.
I would ask that the re-inserted content on Arab culture in the Asia section be removed back to the initial 2020 draft, and not the most recent version.
Very Respectfully, Melinda Mathis
