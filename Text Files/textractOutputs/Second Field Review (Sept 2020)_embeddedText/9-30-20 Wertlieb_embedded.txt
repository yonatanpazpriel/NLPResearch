From: Dave Wertlieb Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 9:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed changes to the ESMC
I fully support the CDE effort to update the proposed ESMC to include content about four traditional Ethnic Studies groups - African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans, and to purge
the curriculum of anti-Semitic content.
I understand that the latest (July 2020) ESMC draft was indeed restricted to the four groups and largely free of offensive content. I also understand that, later, on August 12, the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum. No problem with that, although why it was incorporated into the Asian American curriculum is a mystery. I have learned that the anti-Semitic bias in the 2019 draft was still found in this amended lesson plan.
I strongly urge the IQC to remove inaccurate and offensive material from the proposed curriculum. I also urge that the curriculum include a clear discussion defining anti-Semitism, and why promoting hatred against any of the groups included in the ESMC is racist, xenophobic, and goes against all the values we cherish in this country.
