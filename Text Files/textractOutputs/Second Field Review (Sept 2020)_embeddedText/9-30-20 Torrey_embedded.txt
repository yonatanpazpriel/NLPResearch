From: Yuki torrey Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 1:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment Regarding Including AAPI History in K-12 Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello I am Yukino Torrey and I am an Asian American Studies Student at UCLA, and I am writing you to ask that Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) History be included at a deeper level in the proposed K-12 ethnic studies curriculum. I believe that ethnic studies is so important as someone who did not have any curriculum like it until college, and realize that the Civil Rights Movement organizing around ethnic studies allowed/paved the way for the histories of many ethnic groups to be taught. Moreover, I think that especially for young folks it is important that they learn about all different marginalized groups in the US, especially for folks that are not planning on attending college ( so they can see themselves represented in what they are learning) or before attending higher education and having to choose a class from a specific ethnic studies department or having to specialize in a specific ethnic group for a ethnic studies major. I think that especially in this moment when we are seeing how connected all of our struggles are, I think that a more comprehensive ethnic studies curriculum is more urgent than ever for the K-12 education system in CA, to set a good foundation for solidarity and empathy building for young folks.
Thank you for your time and I hope that the committee seriously take into consideration making the ethnic studies curriculum for K-12 more comprehensive to reflect the diverse experiences of AAPIs!
Sincerely and in solidarity, Yukino Torrey
