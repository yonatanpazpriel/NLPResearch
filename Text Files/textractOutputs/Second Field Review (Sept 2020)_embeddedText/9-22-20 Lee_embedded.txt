Dear California Department of Education, My name is Meejeon Lee and I am the principal of Korean School of Marin County in San Rafael. It is exciting to see that Governor Newson is trying to introduce Ethnic studies into the K-12 curriculum and the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is moving forward. I do believe that a required course in Ethnic Studies has the potential to improve cross cultural understanding and to address the racism that we are witnessing throughout the United States. From my experience of teaching Korean American history at my school, I do strongly believe that the Korean American community's activities, impact, and contribution are significant and an important part of ethnic studies education. We could find a good example that referencing Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose in LA, 1992, and how this contributed to the violence and marginalization of minority groups. This incident implies a significant lesson for unity and solidarity among minority groups. It was also a turning point for many Korean Americans to realize the importance of civic engagement. Korean American experiences and interethnic relations would be very powerful topics for California students to learn how to cooperate with each other in the diverse community of California. On behalf of the Korean School of Marin County, its students and parents, I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans is yet again another act of marginalization and discrimination. Thank you! Regards, Meejeon Lee
