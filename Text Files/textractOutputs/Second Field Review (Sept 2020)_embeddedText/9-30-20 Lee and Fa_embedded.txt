From: Lee, Roselinn ( Linn ) Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 7:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Angelina Fa Subject: [EXTERNAL] Appendix B General Ethnic Studies Lesson
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission,
It is imperative to bring back the significant figures in Ethnic Studies like Dolores Huerta and Fred Korematsu who were present in the original curriculum draft. Attached, please see a necessary lesson we put together for you which allows you to directly integrate key figures into the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) Appendix B: General Ethnic Studies at your November meeting.
We are providing two versions of this lesson for you, the first, with the dominant spelling of history as present in the current ESMC, and the second version foregrounding the spelling of hxstory as is increasingly used in Ethnic Studies classrooms and communities.
The second version also includes a recommendation for the ESMC's Chapter 1, explaining why the purposeful language/spelling conventions are timely and necessary for the ESMC to acknowledge as part of current discussion and discourse, as well as an appendix with examples of these uses.
We look forward to your integration of this lesson into the ESMC, and your updates to Chapter 1 accordingly, to live up to the State Board of Education Guidelines for the curriculum being based on "current and confirmed research", as well as challenging "systems of oppression and the status quo, in an effort to generate discussions on futurity, and imagine new possibilities."
Sincerely,
