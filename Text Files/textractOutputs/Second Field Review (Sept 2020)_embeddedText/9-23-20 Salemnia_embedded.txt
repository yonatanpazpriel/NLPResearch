Dear IQC and SBE members,
I am a resident, an alum of the Los Angeles school system, and a UCLA graduate.
Currently, the planned curriculum fails to include prominent Middle Eastern & North African ethnic groups, ones who make up 60% of California's Middle Eastern peoples. The Middle East isn't just Arab. We are Persian, Druze, Zoroaster, Jewish, Assyrian, and more.
Our state's education is already poor as it is, we don't need to add ignorance on top of it. Then tipping the scales again with Anti-Semitic biases? Jews aren't attacked enough, you want to start education sanctioned hate crimes? Do better. At least have a proper definition of Anti-Semitism. Here is a link to the specific changes you can make: https://www.standwithus.com/esmc-analysis-and-revisions
Be actually inclusive, don't just speak on the colonizing Arab force, speak on the rich native cultures of the region. The people who survived the Arabic ethnic cleansing of the Maghreb, the Levant, and Mesopotamia, the minority religious groups, the stateless nations. Kurds are one of the largest ethnic groups, how can you ignore them? How can you omit the almost one million Jews forced out of their land?
Don't fail our state. Don't make the same mistakes as your predecessors did with Eugenics and other American misinformation. Don't fail our future.
