From: Isaac Engel Sent: Friday, September 18, 2020 2:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] second ESMC draft
I am a longtime resident of California and a product of the California Public School system. I appreciate the need for an Ethnic studies program for California students. In fact, I recall that my High School, situated in the largely upper class, overwhelmingly white enclave of Saratoga, had very progressive Social studies and English programs; e.g. I recall being assigned Richard Wright's Black Boy as reading material. The problem is that the designers of the ESMC have a radical left wing perspective that sees capitalism as the root of all racism, and are much too enamored of the intellectual baggage of the Intersectionality movement. I am grateful that much of the most objectionable material in the first draft of the ESMC were removed after they became public knowledge. I am concerned, however, by reports that some of this material has been snuck back into the program. I strongly urge that the CDE incorporate the recommendations of the Anti-defamation League into the Ethnic studies program, and reject the political maneuverings of the idealogues on the IQC.
Sincerely,
Isaac Engel
