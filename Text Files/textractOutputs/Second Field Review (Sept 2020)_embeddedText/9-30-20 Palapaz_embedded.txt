To whom it may concern
What? I hear that the Department of Education in California has no Japanese American History as part of the curriculum.
It is unbelievable that there is no requirement to include this in the Ethnic Studies Department. Even more so important, Japanese American history should be a mandatory subject in the general study of history in the school system.
Within the past decade, it has been proven that times have not gotten better but worse. This omittance to deny students the important issues of immigration, racism and white supremacy that sparked incarcerating Japanese American and their families, is lessons that speak widely to all people of color. We are all connected.
It is an embarassment to your position and to the children and parents of California that this is not being recognized as an important part of education.
thank you,
