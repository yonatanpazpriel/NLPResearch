From: Matthew Finkelstein Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 1:28 PM Subject: [EXTERNAL] Let the Jewish community know that you hear us in our time of distress. Include our voice in the ESMC!

My name is Matthew Finkelstein. I'm the President of the Jewish Democratic Club of Solano County. At this moment, with Proud Boys being actively called upon by a sitting president, we in the California Jewish community need you to take active measures and send a strong signal that you hear our concerns and are working to ensure that our voices are not erased in the upcoming Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This is an important curriculum and excluding Jews from it is as if to say that Jewish well being is not connected to the well being of other people in the state and that it's less important or somehow less of a priority. I have three major concerns:

1. 2. Mizrahi Jews and MENA minority communities comprise an
estimated 60% of California's population 3. from the region. It is imperative their stories not be erased. By
changing Arab American Studies to Middle Eastern Studies, this much-needed inclusion can be accomplished. 4. 5. 6. California's diverse Middle Eastern populations should be fairly and equitably represented. We 7. are asking the California Department of Education to follow the State Board's standards and guidelines, which require the curriculum to be balanced and portray represented peoples proportionately. 8.

3. And finally As you know antisemitism is a complex subject. Rather than inventing a definition we encourage

you to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition. It is

considered the

gold standard definition embraced by the EU, Germany, over 32 countries and virtually every legacy Jewish org, like

the ADL, AJC etc...

Thank you and I hope that you do consider these three points in the finalizing of the ESMC draft on behalf of myself and the Jewish people.
