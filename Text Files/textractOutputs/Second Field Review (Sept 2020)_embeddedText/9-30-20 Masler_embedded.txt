Dear CDE,
As a second generation holocaust survivor, I am all too aware of what can happen when we begin to allow antisemitism to disseminate and proliferate. Allowing this type of rhetoric into our classrooms, our children's minds, and our collective consciousness is going to be just the beginning if a wave of hate and hate crimes. I stand firmly in the belief that it is when we give in to the pressure of groups that stand for hate, it opens the door for the possibility of past mistakes to be repeated. When I was a child, my dad, a holocaust survivor, told me to always be aware and to never let this happen again - to speak out against the normalizing of abnormal and hateful thinking. Being young and naive, I didnt believe him at the time that something even close to the anti-semitism that led up to the holocaust could ever happen again, especially not on American soil. I hope you are listening and prove me right by banning BDS from the California curriculum - that this will never become possible in this great country of ours. #alllivesmatter #jewishlivesmattertoo
You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools.
Respectfully, Sherri Masler
