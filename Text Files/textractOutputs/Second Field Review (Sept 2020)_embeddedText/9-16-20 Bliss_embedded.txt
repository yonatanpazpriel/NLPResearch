Please eliminate any reference to BDS as it promotes anti semitism. Jews are an ethnicity and their history should be included. Any reference to Israel should be positive or not discussed at all. Include the discussion of the rise of anti semitism in our college campuses and how false information causes hatred of a minority. Jews have long been scapegoats. As it stands now, the curriculum will polarize ethnic groups instead of promoting harmony.
