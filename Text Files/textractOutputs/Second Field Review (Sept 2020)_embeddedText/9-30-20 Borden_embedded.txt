Good evening,
I'm reaching out to formally request that you expand your current Asian American studies curriculum in California, as I feel that there are many more points of study that should be added to give our students a well-rounded understanding of Asian American history. Some examples are Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, and Vietnamese Americans. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, Katie Borden
