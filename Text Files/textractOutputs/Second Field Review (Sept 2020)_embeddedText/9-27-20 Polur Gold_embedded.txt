Hello Ethnic Studies!
I hope that you're having a wonderful Sunday! I am contacting you to implore that you adjust your new lesson plan to teach about all forms of antiSemitism, cover the full diversity of the Jewish community (it's not just European, white Jews), and add a comprehensive lesson plan about communities in the Middle East, including Jews from B.C.E. To the diaspora and Israelis. So many forget or are unaware of the modern day anti-Semitism which plagued the world and is responsible for 2/3 of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Thank you.
