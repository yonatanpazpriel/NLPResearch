From: Young Choi Sent: Monday, September 14, 2020 11:25 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Petition for Inclusion of Korean American Studies in CA's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Sir / Madam,
Considering the current status and influence of Korean American immigrants over 150 years in the mainstream society in relation to the subject, the mainstream society's curriculum includes and introduces Korean people, leading to a better study of national history and social harmony. I think it should be an opportunity. Therefore, we request that you include the history and footsteps of Korean immigration in the curriculum.
Thank you.
Young Choi | Branch Manager
