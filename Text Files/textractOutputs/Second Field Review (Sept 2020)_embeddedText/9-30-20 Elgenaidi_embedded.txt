Dear Members of the California Department of Education and the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee,
We are writing to submit two lesson plans to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Scholars at the Islamic Networks Group (ING), a 27-year-old organization that provides teaching tools and resources to educators in California and all across the country, are working rigorously to create a curriculum with 15 individual lessons that address the role of dominant narratives in shaping racial and ethnic biases. Each lesson plan is centered around reflective exercises to help students critically consider their own experiences with narratives. We are submitting two of the first few lesson plans, "Introducing Narratives" and "Introducing Dominant Narratives," as samples for your consideration.
The first lesson (lesson #1 in the series), "Introducing Narratives," introduces students to how narratives are formed about events or a people by probing the sources of narratives in two ways: a) identifying who the storyteller is, the storyteller's prior or pre-conceived knowledge of the event or person, the assumptions that the storyteller makes, and the storyteller's personal biases; and b) how the storyteller has interpreted the events or person by the selection of what to feature and highlight in the story and what to leave out entirely.
The second lesson (lesson #3 in the series), "Introducing Dominant Narratives," is designed to teach students how to identify and critically evaluate dominant narratives they encounter in their daily lives. This lesson plan also addresses the role of power in perpetuating dominant narratives and determining who benefits from or is harmed by the persistence of these narratives.
Please find the two lesson plans as well as an overview of the full 15-lesson curriculum attached to this email. Thank you for your hard work and dedication to implementing an academically rigorous and balanced model curriculum, and we hope that you find our materials well-suited to the goals of Ethnic Studies.
Sincerely,
Maha Elgenaidi
