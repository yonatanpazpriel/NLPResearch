From: Lucie A Ramsey Sent: Sunday, September 27, 2020 4:51 PM To: Superintendent Cc: [Emails Redacted} Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Feedback
Hello,
My name is [YOUR NAME]. I am a resident of [YOUR LOCATION] and I am emailing today to encourage the inclusion of ALL Middle Eastern communities in the ESMC.
California's diverse Middle Eastern populations should be fairly and equitably represented. We are asking the California Department of Education to follow the State Board's standards and guidelines, which require the curriculum to be balanced and portray represented peoples proportionately.
I strongly urge you to incorporate JIMENA's lesson plan on antisemitism into a revised Middle Eastern and North African section. This plan places a focus on Jewish communities of color and includes the widely recognized definition of antisemitism from the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA).
Thank you for your work revising Sincerely, [YOUR NAME]
