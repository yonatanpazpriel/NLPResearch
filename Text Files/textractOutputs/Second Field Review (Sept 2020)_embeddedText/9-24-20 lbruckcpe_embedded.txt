From: lbruckcpe Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2020 4:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Bigotry in the new curriculum
You folks must think we are all stupid or something. Well, we're not! This new curriculum is a total distortion of history and facts, and is based solely on the propaganda being pushed by Leftist groups attempting to foster race hatred and ignorance. It's enough already! We do not need an Ethnic Studies curriculum or program in our K-12 schools. We need to follow the curriculum signed into law by President Trump which bolsters true American history and true American patriotism. We will remove our children and our funding from California public schools unless you stop the brainwashing and start telling truth. Like it or not, the time for your continuing lies is over!
