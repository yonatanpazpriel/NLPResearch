I am very concerned about the anti-Israel bias in the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am 94 years old, and grew up attending California public schools. I can remember the antiSemitism of the 1930's. I see a repetition of the same anti-Semitic themes now, just done indirectly, in the vilification of Israel.
The proposed curriculum offers no pro-Israel counterpoint to its anti-Israel bias (as found, for example, in the discussion of Arab Palestinian migration). As we have seen in recent years, the anti-Zionism, encouraged by the one-sided narrative propagated by some educators, has resulted in an increase in anti-Semitism.This is particularly alarming because it comes from individuals who claim to be anti-racist.
Respectfully,
Ada S. Thompson
