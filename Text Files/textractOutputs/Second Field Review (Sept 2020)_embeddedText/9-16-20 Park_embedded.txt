From: Bok-Hee Park Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 8:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Petition to Include Korean American Studies
I work as a teacher in ABCUSD for global leaders.
To not include the Korean American community in the Ethnic Studies Model curriculum would be to ignore a major part of California's and America's heart and soul. Thus, I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans is yet again another marginalization and discriminatory action.
Thank you for your time.
Cheerfully, Bok-Hee Park
