I forgot to mention that it makes no sense for your curriculum to compare Jewish Americans to Irish Americans because Irish Americans are n0t currently the target of hate and hate crimes. We are. Such study questions are not teaching reality. We have enough trouble with holocaust denial without having a mandated curriculum deny our current history in in America
