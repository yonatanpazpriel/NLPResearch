RE: Revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum / AB 331

Dear Governor Newsom:

I am writing to ask that you urge IQC and SBE Members to make the following revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum: `
 Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism in all its forms;  Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA; and,  Remove "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in
violation of AB331.

I am deeply concerned that without adequate safeguards, the discussions in these classrooms could morph into one-sided political advocacy and activism that will both subvert the academic mission of the university, and incite bigotry and harm against students.

Sincerely,

PAUL KORETZ Councilmember, 5th District
