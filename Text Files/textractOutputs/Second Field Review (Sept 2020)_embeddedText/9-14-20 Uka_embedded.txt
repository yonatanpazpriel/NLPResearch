From: Akunna Uka Sent: Monday, September 14, 2020 9:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] In Support of Inclusion of Korean American Experiences
To Whom It May Concern:
I am a social sciences teacher who benefited from participating in the Korean Studies Seminar in preparation for the East Asia course that I teach. As someone who did not grow up in Los Angeles or California, I was impressed by how much Angeleno and Caliornian history can be better understood through the lens of the Korean American experience. The ethnic studies model curriculum will influence curricula across the nation. It is so important that it be as inclusive as possible. Leadership of the National Korean Studies organization provides lesson plans and curriculum ideas to dozens of teachers each year and would gladly offer support so that the ethnic studies model curriculum can be more representative of the California story.
Thank you for reading and amplifying the experiences of people of color through this initiative.
Sincerely,
-Akunna F. Uka Teacher, New Roads School Truman Scholar NY-13
