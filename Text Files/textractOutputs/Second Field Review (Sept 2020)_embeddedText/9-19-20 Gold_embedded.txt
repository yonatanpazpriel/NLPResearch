From: Cheryl Shaffer Sent: Saturday, September 19, 2020 3:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Keep BDS out of the curriculum
To Whom It May Concern I am very fearful of the way education is moving in our state and request full transparency in reviewing the curriculum before the public commenting period is over. I hold you to your pledge of keeping BDS and antisemitism out of the curriculum.
Thank you, Respectfullly, Cheryl Gold
