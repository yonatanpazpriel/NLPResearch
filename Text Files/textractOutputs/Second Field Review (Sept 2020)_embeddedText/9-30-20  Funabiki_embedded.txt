To Superintendent Tony Thurmond
Please maintain Japanese American History in the California Department of Education. All students need to know the history of a group of Americans who lost their civil rights during World War II and were forcibly placed in internment camps. There was no trial to prove that any Japanese Americans had committed any treason or criminal offenses. Families lost their businesses, their homes, vehicles and property when they were forced into the interment camps. When they were released years later those same families had to start all over with nothing to their names.
Another important contribution to the war effort was made by the men and women in the military. Japanese Americans in the Military Intelligence Service, the 442nd Batallion and Merrill's Marauders made huge strides to help end the war. They sacrificed their lives for their country while their families were imprisoned in the internment camps.
You must keep Japanese American History in the curriculum. If this history is withheld from the educational system the same tragedy could fall upon others.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Amy Funabiki
