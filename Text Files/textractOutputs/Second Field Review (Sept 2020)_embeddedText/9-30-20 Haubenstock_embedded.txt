From: Brian Haubenstock Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
My name is Brian Haubenstock I urge you to revise the ethnic studies curriculum to:
� Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism in all its forms.
� Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA.
� Remove guiding values and principles which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
