Hi and I am a mom with two teenagers that live in Marin County. I write to support Jewish studies in the new eduction requirements under consideration related to ethics. It is importance for our children to build empathy around those that are harmed by society, to understand the depth of evil of some leaders, and to appreciate the positive contribution of Jewish culture to society, in general. Thank you for your consideration. Respectfully, Gina DeAngelis
