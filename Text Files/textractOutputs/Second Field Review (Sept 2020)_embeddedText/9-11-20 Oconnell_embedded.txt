To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:
I am very concerned about the state's proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum's anti-Israel bias, and the omission of acknowledgment of anti-Jewish prejudice. Recent incidents at high schools in my county, and rising anti-Semitism across the country, are sometimes excused as "anti-Zionism, not anti-Semitism." The proposed curriculum offers no pro-Israel counterpoint to its anti-Israel bias (as found, for example, in the discussion of Arab Palestinian migration). As we have seen in recent years, the anti-Zionism, encouraged by the one-sided narrative propagated by some educators, has resulted in an increase in anti-Semitism.This is particularly alarming because it comes from individuals who claim to be anti-racist.
Respectfully, Leslie O'Connell, Ph.D.
