Dear California Department of Education, Instructional Quality Commission, and State Board of Education Officials,
We are writing in response to the IQC email sent on the evening of August 12th, 2020, sharing that engagement with stakeholders over the last ten days had continued and resulted in the following changes:
� Replacing "Native American and Indigenous Studies" with "Native American Studies" throughout the document.
� Adding a sample lesson on the Pacific Islander experience. � Adding a sample lesson on Arab American Studies at a time in the near future.
We are pleased to see these improvements, but wanted to raise our ongoing concern at the lack of engagement and responsiveness during this review process with the Sikh community. Despite community members sending in public comment; sharing a letter from 52 of California's Gurdwaras; giving detailed recommendations for meaningful inclusion about the Sikh community; and submitting a petition signed by 1220 people; our requests continue to be ignored.
It is clear from these recent insertions, that there is scope for teaching about specific communities to be included in the curriculum through lesson plans, and it is also clear the Sikh community has not been engaged with or taken seriously as a stakeholder in this process. Meaningful inclusion in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is a critical and urgent conversation that the CDE and IQC needs to have with the Sikh community. We would be grateful for your response and remain committed to working with your team in order to secure meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum through a lesson plan, before it is finalized.
Yours sincerely,
Satjeet Kaur Executive Director The Sikh Coalition
Naindeep Singh Executive Director Jakara Movement
