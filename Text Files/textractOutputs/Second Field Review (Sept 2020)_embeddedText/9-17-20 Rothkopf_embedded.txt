I am writing to you today because I want your curriculum to be the best that it can be and because decisions you make today may influence curriculum around the country. I am particularly concerned about your draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
It's my understanding that the legislature's intent in mandating this curriculum was to bring more attention to the experiences of ethnic groups in California that historically encountered discrimination.
Not only are Jews excluded from the curriculum, the draft includes gratuitous anti-Jewish tropes � including in the lyrics to a rap song � and it endorses anti-Israel activism. As noted in Senator Ben Allen's letter to the Instructional Quality Commission:
The Draft Curriculum Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience The Draft Curriculum Omits Antisemitism The Draft Curriculum Denigrates Jews The Draft Curriculum Singles Out Israel for Condemnation
Weirdly, the glossary created by your team includes definitions of numerous forms of bigotry, yet leaves out anti-Semitism! The glossary, however, includes a lengthy and positive description of the Boycott Divest Sanction (BDS) movement. BDS's goal is to promote discrimination (of American Jews and Israel/Israelis).
Thankfully, Superintendent Thurmond has recommended the CDE remove all language that can be perceived as anti-Semitic and has recommended a draft that provides resources educators can use to acknowledge California's diversity and make connections to the experiences of all students.
On your site, I found the statement that the IQC took action on August 13, 2020, and posted the revised draft chapters. I could not find revisions on the glossary nor sections on Middle Eastern and North African populations.
Elsewhere, I've read that the revised curriculum portrays Jews as a group with "racial privilege" and continues to ignore the experiences of Middle Eastern Jews.
I am particularly alarmed at Jews being described as a group with "racial privilege." First, Jews are not one racial group! Second, "Jewish Privilege" doesn't exist. Please see the enclosed link from the September 2020 issue of Church & State, page 19. I hope that reading Stan Balis' story "Locked Out" will help clarify part of the issues raised in my letter.

The State of California and State Board of Education must take steps to eliminate discrimination and antisemitism from any endorsed curriculum.
Sincerely, Holly Rothkopf
