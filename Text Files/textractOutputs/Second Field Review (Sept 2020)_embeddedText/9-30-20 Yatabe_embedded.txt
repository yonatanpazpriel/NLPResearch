On February 19,1942 Executive Order 9066 was signed by the President of the United States resulting in the relocation of 110,000 people of Japanese ancestry from the west coast to hastily built internment camps. I went as a young boy with my parents and even though my father volunteered for the army and fought in Europe, we were not able to return to California until 1945. Each year on February 19th, I go to the elementary schools to tell what happened to this large group of Asian Americans. The children many of whom are from migrant families have never heard of relocation but completely relate to it when we discuss the plight of migrant children separated from their parents and placed in unsanitary internment camps. Both of these experiences should be part of the ethnic studies program. Please add them.
