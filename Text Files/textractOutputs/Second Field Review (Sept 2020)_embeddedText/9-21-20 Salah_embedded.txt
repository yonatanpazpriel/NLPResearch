Dear Ethic studies dept. The National Association of Asian American studies issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC. Core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in1969 include American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. A decades-long momentum in higher education includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies. Omitting and not specifically naming Arab Studies signals that Arab Americans do not deserve to be seen or heard.
