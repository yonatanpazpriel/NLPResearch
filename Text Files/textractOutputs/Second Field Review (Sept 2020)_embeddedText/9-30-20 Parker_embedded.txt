In Holder v Humanitarian Law Project the Supreme Court of the United States upheld the conviction of the Humanitarian Law Project for providing material support to terrorist organization which is on the US State Department list of designated terrorist organizations. Leila Khaled is a founder and leader of the PFLP which is on this list. When Dr. Abduhadi with the permission of SFSU and the CSU arranged with Zoom to present a lecture by Leila Khaled they violated the Patriot Act, and I believe the curriculum you have created is a similar violation of this law. Zoom withdrew their platform from the Leila Khaled event for this reason. The title of the Humanitarian Law Project curriculum was "Teaching Peace" and its purpose was to teach the terrorists how to accomplish their mission peacefully, and to lessen their reliance on violence. However noble their intention the Supreme Court ruled that they had provided "material support" to terrorists, and had "enhanced the legitimacy" of their organization. When SFSU agreed to allow Leila Khaled to speak to their students they provided material support and enhanced the legitimacy of the PFLP and violated the Patriot Act which is a criminal offence. I believe the ethnic studies curriculum is illegal for the same reason. Before you institute a curriculum which violates the law I suggest you consult with a knowledgeable attorney regarding its legality.
