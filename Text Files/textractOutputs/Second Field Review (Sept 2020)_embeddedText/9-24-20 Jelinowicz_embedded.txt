I do not believe this should be taught in our schools. Appendix A Unit 6 Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American is an example of why it should not be in our schools. This assignment is not good for bringing groups together. According to this unit Jews have gained racial privilege and equality. Jews still face discrimination for being Jewish such as the recent murder of an Orange County boy being killed for being Jewish, synagogue shooting in Poway, swastikas spray painted at Jewish Cemeteries and many other local events. This is biased and leads students to the wrong conclusions. Please do not allow these ethnic studies to be taught in our schools. We need to bring groups together and this curriculum does not do the job.
