From: Ammar Qadan Sent: Sunday, September 20, 2020 3:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic Studies,
Ethnic Studies must be inclusive, and not an excuse to further erase the voices of Arab Americans. Arab American studies as a core part of the Asian American studies curriculum is not only essential but a moral imperative. An outcome that excludes or casts aside this vulnerable community will further diminish a voice that is already underrepresented. If Arab Americans are not registered we become unsafe and unable to contribute to our society like other Americans.
Thank You in advance for your kind action
