From: Steve Epner Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:20 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Address anti-Semitism. With anti-Semitism on the rise in the world including California, it is unconscionable not to include it's discussion for the ethnic studies model curriculum. This is a shameful and deliberate omission that should be rectified; a sin of omission.
