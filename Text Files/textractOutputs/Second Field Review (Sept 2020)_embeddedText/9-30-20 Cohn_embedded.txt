Action Alert: Ask the CA Department of Education for Continued Improvement on the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Since last year, the Jewish Public Affairs Committee (JPAC) has been advocating for the removal of anti-Israel and antisemitic themes in California's draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). JPAC is a coalition that includes our JCRC and 24 other Jewish institutions across California.
Thanks to these efforts and those of others, the CA Department of Education (CDE) released recommendations for an improved second draft on August 3. Here is a link to the second model curriculum draft: https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/esmc2ndfieldreview.asp. However, on August 12 the CDE announced three major changes to the curriculum, mere hours before the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) was set to reconvene. While they removed denigrating content from the initial draft and acknowledged that antisemitism is a form of hate, the four requests below show that there is still work to be done in order to ensure the curriculum offers a safe and representative education for all California students. I ask the CA Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to accept and pledge to the following FOUR requests related to the ESMC: 1. The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism. 2. No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future. 3. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color. 4. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum. Thank you, Marianne Cohn,
