From: Arthur Yoshii Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 2:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Asian American Ethnic Studies - Public Comment
To Tony Thurmond:
It has come to my attention that the current outline of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum disregards the Japanese American, Vietnamese American, Korean American, and South Asian American groups from the lesson outline. I am also aware that the first draft of the curriculum had a Panethnic Asian studies which covered issues such as the Model Minority Myth. This is critical to our Asian American history, and to leave this section out would be a disservice to the children who don't understand what it means to be Asian American, despite being bullied and attacked by others for being Asian American.
Although you've spoken to the APISBMA advocacy group about this, and a positive conversation was had moving forward with the next draft of the outline, I want to use this email as a reminder to keep to your word.
Please pay attention to the Asian American curriculum in your Ethnic Studies proposal as to be more inclusive and include detailed lesson plans of each diverse group.
Thank you, Arthur Yoshii
