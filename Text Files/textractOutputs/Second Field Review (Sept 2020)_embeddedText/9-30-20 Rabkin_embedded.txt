I join with ADL in renewing their call for a lesson plan on Jewish Americans and inclusion of a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry, supporting AB 331 ï¿½ High school course requirement in Ethnic Studies:
I agree with ADL in supporting AB 331 which will require California high school students to complete an Ethnic Studies course to graduate. As a leading provider of anti-bias education, ADL recognizes that attitudes and beliefs affect actions and our communities. To that end, ADL supports adding Ethnic Studies to California's high school curriculum. A pedagogically sound Ethnic Studies course will promote respect among students by teaching about the diverse histories, cultures, and contributions to our nation.
