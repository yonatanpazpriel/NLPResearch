From: marilyn meier Sent: Friday, September 11, 2020 3:50 PM To: Superintendent Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
Mr. Tony Thurmond Superintendent of Public Instruction
I would hope that you will speak out. Please be an advocate for inclusion. Please help to make a change to the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. At the moment, Jews are not listed as a group that gets targeted. But white supremacists are always keeping Jews as a target and consider them an ethnicity not just a religion and they have acted and killed people they believe to be Jewish. If this course might help diminish hate in our state, please be a voice for inclusion.
