To whom it may concern,
As a native Californian, I have enjoyed the open and accepting nature of the California lifestyle. However, when I read the planned curriculum for ethnic studies, I was appalled and distraught that the state that I have called home for most of my life would turn its back on the Jewish community with such vile hate and antisemitism. Please remove these parts of the curriculum and give a fair and balanced approach to ethnic studies to the children of our state.
Thank you, Karen
