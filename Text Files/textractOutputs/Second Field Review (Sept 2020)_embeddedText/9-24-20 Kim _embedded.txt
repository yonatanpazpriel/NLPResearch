From: Helen Kim Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2020 1:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education,
While it is exciting to see that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is moving forward and students will have the opportunity to learn about our diverse community, I am deeply concerned that Korean American studies have been excluded.........
Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. To leave out Korean Americans would be yet another marginalization and discriminatory action. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely,
Helen Kim New Praise Church Korean Studies Class
