We are a nation of laws. Those that break the law and resist the police are criminals. We should not be teaching kids to disobey law enforcement. We ahould be teaching them to respect the police, military, our National anthem. I oppose this curriculum because the final parts is teaching them to disobey law enforcement. That is not how our system works. We have methods to change the law. You should spend more time teaching them about freedom, responsibly, strong work ethics and less time listening to terrorist groups that kill people who say all lives matter. bLM is a political party. 100 percent of tgeir donation goes to one party. If you allow this you also jeed to allow the Tea Party to teach. Please stop the insanity.
