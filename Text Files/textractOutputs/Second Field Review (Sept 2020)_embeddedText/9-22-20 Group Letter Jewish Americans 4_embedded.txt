From: Ellia Torkian Sent: Monday, September 21, 2020 8:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Jews in the Curriculum
Dear IQC and SBE Members,
I am a California Jewish high school student/ally. We deserve an adequate ethnic studies model curriculum that represents our history in the classroom. We are calling for the curriculum to: � teach about antisemitism in all its forms. � represent the diversity of the Jewish community. �include a lesson plan about Middle Eastern communities, including Jews.
Thank you!
Best, Ellia Torkian
