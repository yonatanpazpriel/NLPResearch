On May 5, 2016 after an Israel Independence Day event which was scheduled to be held in the quad at SFSU did not occur as scheduled I made sign which read "Jews are the Indigenous People of the Land of Israel." I remember the date because it was shortly after the Mayor of Jerusalem was shouted down by Palestinian "protesters." I believe this was the first time this concept had been enunciated on this campus. As I walked around the quad with the sign on my head I was accosted by a very big guy who threatened me, and took the marking pen I had used to make the sign out of my pocket. Later, when I saw the Dean of the School of Ethnic Studies I asked him why Jews were not included in ethnic studies, and he told me that they had never asked to be included. While we were talking the big guy came up and stood next to the Dean as if to make it clear that they were friends. When I asked them for the name of this big guy they both refused to tell me. So now I am publicly asking Kenneth P. Montiero to recognize that Jews are the indigenous people of the land of Israel, and to stop teaching the falsehood that we are "European colonists who have stolen the land from the indigenous Palestinans." Contained inthis email is an overview of Jewish history which shows that the Arabs are the colonial settlers who stole the land from the indigenous Jews.

Hi Barry, I received a promo from Stand With Us which included a booklet entitled "Israel Timeline: A Journey Over 3,000 years. On the first page it says "Over 3,000 years ago an in igenous people developed a thriving civilization and culture in their homeland." It goes on to give an excellent overview of Jewish history. I went to their website and found that this booklet is on their download page. Can this be copied and pasted into a link which I can forward? I still think that teaching about our indigenous status is the only

way to change the perception of our relationship to the land of Israel, and I am thrilled that SWU has begun to use this term in their booklets. Best, Ruth
