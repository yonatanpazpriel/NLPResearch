Governor Gavin Newsom and C.D.E. Chancellors, Good Morning!
I wholeheartedly support the concept and commend your signing into law AB1460 mandating ethnic studies as part of college matriculation requirements. It should, in theory, serve to broaden understanding of the history of thy neighbor and would put California on the cutting edge of taking steps to combat `racism.' However, the plan, to my understanding, limits itself to educate California youth about the history of four specific populations: African-Americans; Asian-Americans; Latina and Latin-Americans; and Native-Americans. This will serve as an effective reference resource of knowledge that the ethnic studies' students can share with their parents, grandparents, siblings and neighbors. Yet, it overlooks the other dreadful 'ism'; anti-Semitism.
This may prove a long term significant oversight for California Jews directly, and the other approximate 7 million American Jewish citizens, indirectly. California has the fourth largest educational system in the U.S. and is a trend setter for the rest of our nation. Since the ethnic studies endeavor may well be funded with State and Federal dollars, I think it most appropriate to see if Anti-Semitism education can be incorporated somewhere within the program when the C.D.E. hammers out the details in the near future. After all, how many opportunities cross our path where we can make a positive difference? Governor Newsom and Chancellors, this may well be one of them.
Unless one has experienced Anti-Semitism personally, I doubt that they can ever be in a position to fully recognize and then commit to rectify

this abomination. With my compliments, I am providing you and the C.S.U. Chancellors, a brief, but pertinent appreciation for what Jews are experiencing:
"Anti-Semitism, an overdue review" (763 word Op-ed)

Anti-Semitism has been, is, and will probably continue to be a scourge until fully understood and then passionately opposed.
For those fortunate not to have been targeted, it's a spectrum of discriminatory activities aimed solely at Jews. It ranges from hate speech to violent and potentially lethal confrontations, often associated with property damage including desecration of religious and cultural institutions.
White supremacists, radical Islamists, Iran and proxies were once at the forefront of those leading the charge against Jews and Israel. Later, various subgroups supplemented their ranks, including a number who tactically projected the less threatening persona of anti-Zionism, effectively masking an anti-Jewish agenda.
To a degree, hatred claimed legitimacy from the endless flow of antiIsrael/anti-Jewish rhetoric spewing forth from the United Nations; various social bonding groups including Neo-Nazis and the K.K.K.; and spiritual leaders the likes of Minister, Louis Farrakhan; among others.

This set the groundwork for Students for Justice in Palestine and others of similar ilk. S.J.P. found welcoming breeding grounds on college campuses across the United States. There, they challenged Israel's legitimacy and threatened her viability via Boycott, Divestment and Sanction demands; a significant part of their modus operandi. With no shortage of receptive teaching staff and naï¿½ve, angry students, their ranks swelled. This was more so, as few administrators were willing to take on contentious student groups operating under the cloak of "social Justice," while blaming every misfortune on Jews and Israel.
To inflame passions, they utilized words such as "apartheid state" and "genocide" in conjunction with unsubstantiated allegations of brutality towards Palestinians; and anti-Israel confrontations followed. With media present, the drama intensified. Repeating falsehoods over and over again, contentious leaders convinced themselves and their lockstep followers of the effectiveness of deceptive propaganda; similar to Nazis tactics in the 1930's.
Antagonistic politicians including U.S. Representatives: Ilhan Abdullahi Omar (D-Minn 5th D) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mi 13th), among others; seemingly ignored select concerns of their Jewish constituencies, as well as other American Jewish citizens in favor of pursuing personal antiIsrael agendas. This provided an additional source of agitation. Some responsibility for this failing must be borne by, Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, their mentor, who avoided confrontation with upcoming party hot-heads.
Recognizing vulnerability and seemingly unopposed, provocateurs act as if they have free rein to regard Jews and others who support Israel as targets of opportunity. Not surprisingly, hate-incidents are on the rise on campuses and elsewhere.
Protections under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 offered recourse for discrimination based specifically on race, color, and national origin. As a result, Jews found themselves on the receiving end

of occasional religious discriminatory attacks. Even with President Trump's 12/11/2019 Executive Order directing the Department of Education to consider anti-Israel bias on the basis of Jewish ethnicism; yet at the end of the day, Ken Marcus, D.O.E., Office of Civil Rights will have to determine in court if this E.O. proves a sufficient deterrent. So far, I doubt it.
With Jews increasingly regarded as a so-called "privileged" subclass within white America, and not the historic "Vulnerable" at-risk minority they are; the ability to mount a bipartisan legislative consensus to combat anti-Semitism is proving complicated.
It will, therefore, require an organized outcry from a broad base of American citizenry; to bring adequate pressure to bear upon congress to motivate it to tackle the injustices not only of racism, but also the "AntiSemitism Pandemic," currently afflicting all levels of America. This abomination respects nothing and makes itself visible any time it wishes, even under the watchful eye of the media.
At what should have been a defining moment within our nation's history; Black Americans marching with others to call attention to the brutal death of George Floyd; was instead compromised by focused hatred when a contingent broke away and flagrantly and violently attacked Jewish individuals, businesses, homes, religious institutions, in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles, as one case among others.
Looters stole much more than money and possessions. They bullied away the dignity from another group of historically oppressed individuals, including aged Holocaust survivors. This was made even more frightening with law enforcement appearing restricted in their involvement. This was reminiscent of the November 9-10, 1938 Kristallnacht Holocaust nightmare. In both cases and with probably more to follow; acts of anarchy appeared tolerated and therefore proceeded and will likely continue to do so.

BLM and many other protestors against racism appear willfully ignorant of the other `ism,' anti-Semitism; and therefore do not know enough to care, let alone rectify this abomination. They and others are overdue for a history lesson.
