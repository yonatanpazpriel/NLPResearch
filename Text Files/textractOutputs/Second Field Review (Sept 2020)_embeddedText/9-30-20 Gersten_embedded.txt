Dear CDE,
I am concerned that after being pressured by organizations trying to restore BDS and antisemitism to the curriculum, the CDE has added a chapter that is not open to review. I welcome an Arab-American lesson, but not one guided by the hand of BDS radicals and hidden from the public. The protocol of allowing the public to review the curriculum and comment on it allows constituents to hold the CDE to its commitment against discrimination, as promised when revising the first draft. I ask that the CDE stand by its previous pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum, and to open the additional sample chapter up to fair and transparent review prior to the closing of the comment period on September 30th.
The United States Congress and many governments around the world oppose and condemn BDS for what it is-blatant discrimination, and therefore is an affront to Americans of all races, colors and religions, let alone California taxpayers, students and teachers. It is also is marked contravention of the international IHRA definition of antisemitism.
Do not allow for the teaching of our children hate for Jewish people and the State if Israel. There is enough of that around the world without allowing the indoctrination of it as well in our children.
As taxpayers and educators in this state, we implore you to reject BDS and antisemitism in our public school curriculums.
Bill and Cassandra Gersten
