California Department of Education
Greetings,
Dear California Department of Education,
The inclusion of Ethnic Studies in our education system is a great step forward. However, the exclusion of Korean American studies from California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is deeply concerning. This is a petition to include Korean American studies in the Asian American studies portion of the curriculum.
The Korean American community has long helped shape the American landscape through its community activities, its contributions, and more. For example, we can't discuss the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest without including Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose during that period and how this contributed to the violence against and marginalization of Asian Americans. Korean Americans including Dr. Sammy Lee and Col. Young Oak Kim also helped shape this country through their actions, valor, and character. Dr. Lee won Olympic gold for America in 1948 and 1952 and was the first Asian American man to do so. Col. Kim was a U.S. Army officer who became the first Asian American man to lead a combat battalion on the field during the Korean War. He was also a World War II hero. His humanitarian efforts also shaped the landscape of Los Angeles through the founding of several nonprofits and organizations that help the youth, battered women, and minorities.
Korean American history and identity should be taught as part of the curriculum because this community played a major role in California and the country. Korean Americans founded the Willows Korean Aviation School/Corps in Willows, CA in 1920. The Korean Air Force views the school as its origin. To understand the Korean American community, its history and ethnic identity is to also understand the framework of our country and how this great nation is made up of minorities and their histories.
Also, California recognizes Korean Americans through two resolutions. Hangul Day was passed on October 19, 2019 and recognizes Korean Americans as "an integral part of mainstream American society and have made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance,

technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas."
California also recognized Korean American Day on January 13, 2020 by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 142 citing that "with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to turn emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans."
To leave out Korean Americans from California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is yet another marginalization and discriminatory action.

America, Korean Americans have been through a lot in society and contributed to many essential fields."
"I'm an American who comes from Korea and it just makes sense to include the roles Korean Americans have played in the history of this state and nation!"
"I am a retired educator of color who worked with ALL students in CA's demographic during my 47 years in education. The whole notion of leaving anybody out or belittling anyone's contribution to our national history is offensive to me."
"It is part of history so it should be included it."
"Steve Do"
"Learning the history is much more valuable than anything else"
"Just as a suggestion, it would be very informative to include what the current ethnic studies curriculum is consists of in the conclusion so that we have to compare this lack of inclusion to."
"I want Korean's to be included"
"I'm signing. This is very important matters especially for the Korean people!"
"It's important!"
"Korean history should be taught."
"Jennifer lee"
"As a Korean-American attorney who has been practicing immigration law for the past 40 years, I have observed the contributions Korean- Americans have made to make our community a better America."
"It's important"
"The exclusion of Korean Americans from last year's California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum was unacceptable. We must no longer accept being invisible! The nearly 2 million Korean Americans have been part of the fabric of this country since 1890, when the first Korean became a US Citizen (Philip Jaisohn ). For too long, the Korean American experience has been been excluded, despite our contributions to the growth of this country during the 20th century to present. Please ensure that we are included and share this with others you know."
"For Koreans to have been left out in the last proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) was completely unacceptable. I am signing this because Korean Americans should no longer accept being invisible. The nearly 2 million Korean Americans have been

Comment
part of this country since 1890, when the first Korean became a US Citizen (Philip Jaisohn ). Korean Americans have contributed greatly to the foundation and fabric of this country throughout the 20th century. We have shaped the landscape of cities such as Los Angeles, Flushing, NY, Fort Lee, NJ, Palisades Park, NJ, Alexandria, VA, Irvine, CA and so many more. It is critical that students are provided with the knowledge, history, context to fully appreciate the role of Korean Americans in this country."

"I want to study about Korea!!"
"This is important to our future generations learn their roots and history."
"Sarahkeesook kim"
"I support Korean American studies and the community is an important part of the American tapestry."
"Bc all cultures and ethnicities deserve the right to be learned and taught."
"Our family immigrated from Korea on Dec 12, 1979 to Los Angeles. Father was a ranking officer of the Korean military. For those that know Korean history 12/12/1979 is a significant date. Our family now resides in NJ but we work hard to pass on as much history as we can. Very important. Such a program exist at USC (alma mater) with a center. Further accessibility would be important course."
"No one is free until we are all free. Celebrate and educate on cultures, undo genocide."
"I'm Korean American"
"Disaggregating Asian Americans in ethnic studies curriculums is a necessary step towards diversity and inclusion. Korean Americans have uniquely shaped every sector, particularly in California."
"Koreans are a distinct cultural group and deserve the attention and scholarship that entails. Period."
"It's important"
"I'm signing because I believe all history and cultures are important. How can we teach future generations compassion and understanding and diversity if we do not broaden their education and views?"
"Dear California Department of Education, While it is exciting to see that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is moving forward and students will have the opportunity to learn about our diverse community, I am deeply concerned that Korean American studies have been excluded.Korean Americans including Kyong Won "K.W." Lee should also be taught about. He is considered the godfather of Asian American journalism, being he was the first Asian American hired by American media. Lee spearheaded the investigation into the Chol Soo Lee case while he worked for the Sacramento Union. K.W. Lee wrote hundreds of articles on the wrongful conviction of Korean American Chol Soo Lee, causing the Free Chol Soo Lee Movement. The demonstrations and protests became the first Pan-Asian movement and resulted in Chol Soo Lee's acquittal. Such a historic case should not be ignored.Angela Oh is another
