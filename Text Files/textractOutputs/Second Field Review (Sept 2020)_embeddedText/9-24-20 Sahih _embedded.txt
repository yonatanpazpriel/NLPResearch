To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to you regarding the CA ethnic studies curriculum that will be implemented in all public schools. I want to take time to request that anti-Semitic language and BDS are kept out and that the curriculum offers fair representation for all California students. In addition, I request the following:
1) Include broad Jewish American experiences including the holocaust and to teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing to the ESMC
I appreciate your consideration in this important matter.
Respecfully,
