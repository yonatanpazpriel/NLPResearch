Guiding Principles of Ethnic Studies and Related Course (in Los Angeles Unified School District):
https://achieve.lausd.net/cms/lib/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/226/Principles%202017.pdf
� *The course examines the experiences, histories, struggles and victories of ethnic and cultural groups, with a focus on African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Chicana/os and Latina/os, American Indians.
� The course examines how race and ethnicity have been constructed in the United States, have changed over time, and continue to shape the country today (History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016).
� The course will teach students to understand the concepts of intersectionality1,power, privilege and/or oppression in relation to: o Their own **identities as human beings and acknowledging their ancestral roots. o The complexity and diversity of the American experience.
� To establish the context of Ethnic Studies and related courses, the course will include aspects of the history of Los Angeles and American Indians native to the Southern California region.
� The course concentrates on building the capacity of students to interact effectively in a culturally diverse society. As culturally competent persons, students can assess their own cultural orientation, value diversity, manage the dynamics of differences and adapt to diversity (Lindsey, 2013).
� The course emphasizes mutual respect, dignity, and self-worth of all students, while also acknowledging that students begin the course with intellectual assets, knowledge of their culture and that they are sources of community wealth.
� The course will teach students about social justice and social responsibility, and to understand that they can become agents of change at local, state, national, and global levels.
� The course will teach students to examine colonialism, its significance historically, and its significance to their own ancestral legacies.
� The course will develop student perspectives and modes of thoughtful judgment designed to extend critical thinking(History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016, p.744).
� The course will include curriculum, resources, and materials include a balance of topics, authors, and concepts, including primary and secondary sources that represent multiple, and sometimes opposing, points of view or perspectives (History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016).

Introduction
In an Ethnic Studies course:
� "Students will become aware of the constant themes of social justice and responsibility, while recognizing these are defined differently over time" (History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, p. 420).
� "Students may consider how to improve their own community, what constructive actions can be taken, and whether they are providing a model for change [in their communities] and for those in other parts of the state, country, and world." (HistorySocial Science Framework for California Public Schools, p. 422)

� Students will learn about social justice and social responsibility,and understand that they can become agents of change at local, state, national, and global levels.
Implications for the Classroom
� Regarding students' rights and responsibilities, please see the LAUSD Parent Student Handbook.http://achieve.lausd.net/cms/lib08/CA01000043/Centricity/Domain/577/Ha ndbooks/Parent%20Student%20handbook_%202016%2017.pdf
� An ethnic studies course should provide students with depth of understanding in relation to ethnic and social issues, rather than promoting specific political activism, demonstration, protest or the like. Ethnic studies is a scientific inquiry of ethnic groups and their interrelations (Yang, 2010, pg. 14)
An Ethnic Studies course:
� Should include examples of civic engagement (e.g., voting and other peaceful social justice activities) and the impact they have had on United States history. Students who are considering volunteering, social justice activities, community engagement, etc., should consult with their school teacher/advisor and parents/guardians to evaluate that the activities are lawful, peaceful,and nonviolent.
� "Whenever possible, should [create] opportunities for participation and for reflection on the responsibilities of citizens in a free society" (History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools,2016,p. 19).

...
Description of Each Guiding Principle: 1. Attend to the varied student populations in the classroom by embracing diversity as an asset for engaging in rich and rigorous instruction. Ethnic studies is inclusive of students and families from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, sexual orientation, race, class, gender, socioeconomic, linguistic, and ability backgrounds. Culturally competent teachers respect and integrate these differences into their instruction. Students who are still developing their academic, linguistic, cognitive, and social-emotionalcompetencies are viewed as able, important contributors to the classroom discourse.
2. Explicitly teach the academic skills, habits of mind, and rhetorical strategies that are employed when engaging in reading, writing, speaking, and thinking in the area of ethnic studies. Ethnic studies teachers should expose students to a variety of instructional practices and techniques designed to assist students in identifying the strategies and appeals employed in text or visual media. Effective instruction embeds the critical aspects of thinking in the history/social science and literature disciplines, including explicit modeling and practice with sourcing, contextualizing, and corroborating evidence (Wineburg 1991, Seixas 2009, De La Paz 2013). Ethnic studies teachers provide ample opportunities for guided collaborative practice and independent practice, both orally and in writing as well as through the use of visual aids and/or media. Teachers utilize a gradual release of responsibility approach that fades, scaffoldsand supports, and promotes self-regulation of learning so students build independence with their academic skills (Wineburg 1991, De La Paz 2005, De La Paz & Felton 2010). Teachers must also provide explicit instruction on the essential elements of expository and argumentative writing by allowing students to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize evidence from multiple historical and/or literary sources, as well as learn from models and rubrics when developing proficient historical analysis and fluent writing (Young & Leinhardt 1998, De La Paz 2013).
