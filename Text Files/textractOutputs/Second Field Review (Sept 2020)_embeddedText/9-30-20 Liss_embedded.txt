As a former educator, I am very concerned. Please correct the anti-semitic bias of this curriculum! Marcia Liss
Under California's AB 331, California high school students will be required to complete an Ethnic Studies course to graduate. After the ADL and allies successfully prevented the adoption of a biased 2019 version of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), the California Department of Education (CDE) ordered a new draft. Officials pledged to restrict the content to four traditional Ethnic Studies groups - African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans, and committed to purge the curriculum of antisemitic and anti-Israel content.
The July 2020 ESMC draft was indeed restricted to the four groups and largely free of offensive content. ADL submitted initial comment towards improving the draft. Later, on August 12, the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum. Unfortunately, the antisemitic and anti-Israel bias in the 2019 draft was found in the lesson plan.
As a Jewish community, we have a special duty to speak out and stand up when we experience injustice. If California passes this curriculum without correcting the antisemitic bias,it can reverberate throughout the country because states often borrow curriculum from each other due to a process that can be expensive and time-consuming.
The deadline for registering your concerns with the state is Wednesday, September 30. To learn how you can take action, follow this link: https://sandiego.adl.org/.../takeaction-on-ethnic.../
