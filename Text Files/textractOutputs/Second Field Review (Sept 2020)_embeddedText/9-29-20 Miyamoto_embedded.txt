Dear Tony Thurmond,
It has come to my attention that the current outline of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum disregards the Japanese American experience. It is a vital part of our history that Japanese Americans were placed in concentration camps during world war 2. These were American citizens whose personal property, real estate and bank accounts were seized.
The 442nd division of the military is the most highly decorated unit made up of Japanese-American soldiers while their families were placed in concentration camps without legitimate reason.
The model minority myth is so important to dispel as well.
Although you've spoken to the APISBMA advocacy group about this, and a positive conversation was had moving forward with the next draft of the outline, I want to use this email as a reminder to keep to your word.
Please pay attention to the Asian American curriculum in your Ethnic Studies proposal as to be more inclusive and include detailed lesson plans of each diverse group.
Thank you,
