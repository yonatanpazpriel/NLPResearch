From: Jasmine Yadegar Sent: Tuesday, September 8, 2020 10:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
To whom this may concern:
I was born and raised here in the U.S. I spent most of my life in school and have a PhD in Industrial/Organizational Psychology. Never in all these years did we study anything that taught us any form of racism whether it was by form of race, gender, ethnicity, minority, etc. Any form of prejudice and racism is not ok. In this day and age, I cannot understand how and why we would go backwards as a society and community to encourage any type of study that would bring forth any form of prejudice, racism and injustice that we've been trying to eradicate for many years.
I will pull my children out of school and homeschool them and file a lawsuit if anything of this nature does pass and come about for my children and future generations to come. This is a terrible example to set for students. This is the very reason many people left their countries to come to the U.S. and now we are moving backwards. It's so sad and completely unacceptable.
I would like more information about AB-331 Pupil instruction: high school graduation requirements: ethnic studies - how it came about, why it's being considered and why we have to even have this exchange. What good will this bring? What are we expecting students to learn and get out of this curriculum and why?
