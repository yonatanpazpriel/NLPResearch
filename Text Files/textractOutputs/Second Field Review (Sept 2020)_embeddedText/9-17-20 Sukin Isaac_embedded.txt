I read the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Appendix A, Unit 6 and found the content alarming, particularly this sentence:
"[Students] will be asked to think critically about why and who is allowing this evolution [of Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege] in white identity and how this shift is affecting the identity of Irish and Jewish Americans."
Who is allowing this evolution in white identity? Really? This makes it sound like there is some semitic cabal that is conspiring to corrupt traditional white heritage. Of course that's not the case.
Further, the whole framing of "how do Jews and Irish people affect white identity" casts Jews and Irish people as fundamentally non-white. Firstly, not all ethnic Jews are white. Some are from the Middle East or Africa and have non-white skin tones. Completely ignoring those people is harmful. Second, white Jews and Irish people aren't suddenly becoming white and joining the skinhead party. Maybe racists who thought of "white" as somehow excluding some white-skinned people have realized they don't get to define what "white" means, but it's not like racists are the educational authority who get to define what "white identity" means.
