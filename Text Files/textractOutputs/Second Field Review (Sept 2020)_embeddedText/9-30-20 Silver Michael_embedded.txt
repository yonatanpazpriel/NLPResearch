Hasn't the world had enough of hatred and anti-Semitism--why must the CDE contribute to the sickness by indoctrinating young students with false and damaging propaganda. I urge the CDE to stand by its pledge to exclude BDS and anti-Semitism from its curriculum. The rest of the country and the world is watching to see if the CDE will take the high road.
Sincerely, Michael Silver
