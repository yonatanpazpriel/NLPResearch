The `new' anti-sematism (read: hate speech) is to pretend that this is about Israel when we all know - even you if you arer honest with yourself - that it is the `new' cover for hatred of Jews.
Given your professed openness and sense of fairness, the list of so-called truths above Jews - shall we start with the ridiculousness that Jews and white supremacists - some of whom I've helped to prosecute - are somehow connected or even remotely on the same page is so patently ridiculous, actually stupid! on it's face - that if you even hint at subscribing to such a belief system then really, get up tomorrow, look in the mirror and look at the face of a phony, miserable, projecting and dishonest racist.
Hopefully, you might not have to look in that mirror. Odds, unfortunately, say `yes.'
Have a good evening.
PS: I just took a week long trip across America. Do you know that most people are decent, honest, hard working, down-to-earth and much more (in that vain)? The cravenness of your potential actions are antithetical to such decent people and every decent thing that they, and so many more, are part of. Smarten up, please.
