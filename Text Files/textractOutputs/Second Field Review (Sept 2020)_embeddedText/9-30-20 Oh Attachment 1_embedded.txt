Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Dosan Ahn Chang Ho was a Korean American leader and Korean patriot who founded the first organized-Korean American settlement in the United States in early 1905. He was a political and Korean independence activist who fought for the rights of Koreans in the U.S. and around the world. He raised the Korean American voice and identity in the early 1900s. Dosan also created a Korean Labor Bureau in Riverside, CA to help Korean workers find better jobs and working conditions. Dosan also established several Korean organizations in the U.S. in the hopes his community would gain voice and identity in America. The lesson demonstrates the struggles ethnic minorities like Korean Americans had to go through in the early 20th century.
Today, there is a Dosan Ahn Chang Ho statue in Riverside, CA commemorating his work. Also, the Korean National Association building in Los Angeles is still standing and serves as a reminder of the early-Korean American community's independence efforts and doubles as a museum. In 2002, the I-10/I-110 interchange was named the "Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange" and is a marker of the diversity of our nation's roots and future.

This lesson uses videos, books, and articles to illustrate how Korean Americans navigated the multiethnic landscape of California and the United States in the early 1900s with Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's help and leadership.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, First Koreatown USA, identity, ethnic voice, multicultural, multiethnic, labor.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Better understand the Korean American experience and multiethnic America through the story and lives of the Koreans who lived at Pachappa Camp, the first Koreatown USA established by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho in 1905.
� Write an essay, report, or video about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's efforts to raise Korean American voice and identity through his organizations, civic activity, and labor management efforts through the Korean Labor Bureau. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure their essay writing skills and learn how to use video presentations, which is an essential skill to have in the online learning platform.
Essential Questions:
1. Why is it important to study the stories of ethnic minorities like Koreans in the United States?
2. What do the struggles for voice and identity by Korean Americans reveal about America's racial history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Korean Americans through the story of Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and his efforts to raise the voice and identity of the small community, (read essential questions 1�2 aloud).

2. The teacher presents some basic information about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and the early Korean American community. The teacher asks students if they have questions about Korean Americans and writes them on the white board.
3. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the early-Korean American community and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.
4. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
5. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Korean American experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a clip from a video about Korean Americans and the early community during the early 20th century. Note the students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured as they looked for labor, shelter, and identity in the United States:
"Footsteps of Korean Americans," a short Documentary about the experiences of Koreans in the United States gives a concise overview of when, how, why, Koreans came to America. The film covers Korean American community development and identity in the early 1900s and discusses Dosan and Pachappa Camp. The documentary's narrative shows the development of the Korean American community within the context of race relations in the United States. The film ends on a positive note with an overview of how Korean Americans are facing and dealing with the racial divide in the U.S. and at the same time learning to deal with its newfound identity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtOtB5yuQ (37 minutes total. Only show the first 9 minutes and 25 seconds on Pachappa and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho).
6. The teacher shows a short video about Pachappa Camp published by the University of California Riverside June 2019. As students watch the short video

describing the camp and the early-Korean American community, they should think about how these Korean Americans lived, struggled, and developed their identities and voices during the early 1900s when anti-Asian sentiment was high.. https://youtu.be/YwylsG066I8.
7. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (For example: What were some of the struggles Korean Americans faced in the early 1900s?) Students should think for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Korean Americans were struggling for voice and identity because their homeland was no longer a country but a colony of Japan during the early 1900s. Thus, Korean Americans faced double racism and oppression from the Japanese and from Americans whose anti-Asian sentiments were high.
� Korean Americans must have felt a great deal of frustration and sadness at the loss of their homeland to Japan.
� Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and other Korean American leaders worked for the independence of Korea and established organizations and communities like Pachappa Camp to help raise the voice and identity of their people.
� Korean Americans learned to embrace both their host country's culture and keep their heritage and culture while pursuing independence activities.
� Ultimately, Korean Americans developed an identity of their own.
8. Have students read Chapter 2, pages 15-30 from Korean Americans: A Concise History. As they read the excerpt, students should think about: What it must have

been like for Korean Americans who struggled for the freedom of their homeland while facing racism in the United States? (pages 15-30, Korean Americans: A Concise History by Edward T. Chang and Carol K. Park).
a. As students read the chapter, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the authors, Chang and Lee, what happened to the Korean American community in the early 1900s and how did they gain their voice and identity? (See pages 23-25).
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Racism and discrimination were and are issues to this day. Korean Americans and Asian Americans continue to deal with the issues as do other minorities in the United States.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding historic oppression and racism is marginalized and should be discussed using lessons like this on Korean Americans and other Asian groups.
iii. Minority communities were pillars of strength and places of congregation and learning. The story of Pachappa Camp, founded by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, demonstrates how minority stories actually make up the fabric of U.S. history.
iv. Implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too small of a community to care about by political leaders or documented by historians, must be discussed to show how racism and discrimination are systemic.

Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework: -
Chapter 12 of the framework includes a section (pages 272-276) on how the U.S. changed post-Civil War Era. During the early 1900s the U.S. population began to shift and grow. The chapter asks "Who came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century? Why did they come? What was their experience like when they arrived?" Students will learn about the Korean American role in the changing demographics and landscape of California and the United States.
9. Assessment � To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments:
a. Write one-to-three paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or
b. Discussion group exercise where students are paired in groups of two or three. Each group writes a paragraph about what they learned, and which addresses the essential questions. The group chooses a presenter and they read their work aloud. Then a larger discussion can be held addressing their thoughts about the topics.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: See Step 10 above.
