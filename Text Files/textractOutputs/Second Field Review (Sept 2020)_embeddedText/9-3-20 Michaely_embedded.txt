To whom it may concern I am a mother of twin boys middle school We left West Hollywood elementary due to anti-Semitism. We moved to Beverly hills because we knew that here it will not happen nobody will allow it to happen so please don't allow anybody to teach my kids our kids Jewish kids kids from Israel to hear anti-Semitic doctrine in their school. Thank you Shlomit
