I am a member of the Jewish community of San Jose. I firmly support all efforts by the Jewish agencies to have the CA Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission amend their policy of inclusion and their intention to educate regarding modern era Jewry.
To wit: -AntiSemitism must be defined and understood as the practice of hate and terror that it is. -"Israel" "Jews" and "Israelis" are terms that must be paired with respectful definitions and reference words at all times, in all conditions. -Jews are diverse. An image of a European male with pale skin or facial hair does not and cannot represent the whole of American Jewry--nor should it. The plurality of Jews must be represented and taught.
And finally, Treat with respect those invested in improving or pluralising the representation of Jews in California's educational materials. We are subject matter experts. We are personally involved. We strive for a fair rendering of our people with a not so-dimmed remembrance of what ignorance got us in the 1940's.
Respectfully, MK Hochberg
