From: jmoe Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Reject the Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am concerned that the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is biased and one-sided. For example, the guiding principles in chapter 1 include the following: � Critique empire-building in history and its relationship to white supremacy, racism (as well as
patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism) and other forms of power and oppression � Challenge imperialist/colonial beliefs and practices on multiple levels (Ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized � the four I's of oppression)
The single easiest fix is to remove the "Guiding Values and Principles" while retaining the "Eight Outcomes of K-12 Ethnic Studies." Teachers can align their lesson plans to the Outcomes.
The Outcomes encourage critical analysis of multiple perspectives, but the Values promote a one-sided political agenda. Additionally, the Outcomes require evaluating the strengths and limitations of different approaches to affecting change, but the Values only permit limited types of approaches and don't evaluate the downsides to them. This conflict could confuse K-12 educators.
The proposed "Guiding Values and Principles" conflict with the "History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, 2016", which states that a well-designed Ethnic Studies course should include "a balance of topics, authors, and concepts, including primary and secondary sources that represent multiple, and sometimes opposing, points of view or perspectives".
I believe that a model Ethnic Studies Curriculum will be beneficial for California's diverse student population. However, I ask that you reject the current proposed model and remove the biased and onesided political agenda.
Sincerely,
