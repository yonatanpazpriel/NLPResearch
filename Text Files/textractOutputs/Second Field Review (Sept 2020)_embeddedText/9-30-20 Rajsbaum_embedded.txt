I am writing to you to request changes are made to AB 331 and the model curriculum. Primarily you need to ensure that state approved materials are free from partisan and political bias and do not target any group. And prohibit that teachers use the classroom for one sided partisan activism or advocacy particularly against one group. Although AB 331 has not been finalized it seems like it will promote antisemitism and erase the Jewish minority experience and target Jewish students. Jews are already the largest target of hate crimes in the United States. Proposed lesson plans should not be antisemitic and should not support targeting Jewish students. AB 331 needs to include lessons on antisemitism with an accurate definition such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. So teachers can recognize when the proposed lessons are targeting Jewish students and please add language to prohibit targeting of Jewish students. Please include lessons on Jewish studies that recognize the diversity of the Jewish community. The current curriculum defining Jews alongside Irish as white attempts to strip us of our history and indigenous Semitic roots as well as ignores the incredible diversity of the Jewish community with Ashkenazy, Sepharadic, Mizrahi Jews and Jews of every color and national origin. This also already singles out and attacks two different groups without reason. At the moment there is a huge problem with transparency. There needs to be an opportunity for public comment after each phase of the model curriculum development. Supporting materials and lessons need to be vetted to be free of politics and hate. And material should not be added once public comment is barred. Sincerely, Cynthia Rajsbaum
