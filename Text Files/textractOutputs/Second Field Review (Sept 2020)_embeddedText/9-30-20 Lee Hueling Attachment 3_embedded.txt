The Model Curriculum
Legislation
Assembly Bill 2016, Chapter 327 of the Statutes of 2016, added Section 51226.7 to the Education Code, which directs the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to develop, and the State Board of Education (SBE) to adopt, a model curriculum in ethnic studies.
Consistent with the legislation this document will: (1) offer support for the inclusion of ethnic studies as either a stand-alone elective, and/or to be integrated into existing math, science, history�social science, and English language arts, and/or other courses; (2) be written in language that is inclusive and supportive of multiple users, including teachers (single and multiple-subject), support staff, administrators, and the community, and encourage cultural understanding of how different groups have struggled and worked together, highlighting core ethnic studies concepts such as equality and equity, justice, race[1] and racism[2], ethnicity[3] and bigotry, indigeneity, etc., (3) include course outlines that offer a thematic approach to ethnic studies with concepts that provide space for educators to build in examples and case studies from diverse backgrounds; (4) include course outlines that have been approved by the University of California as having met the "A�G" requirements for college readiness, in addition to sample lesson plans, curricula, primary source documents, pedagogical and professional development resources and tools, current research on the field, among other materials; and (5)

Focus on Four Foundational Disciplines
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will focus on the traditional, ethnic studies first established in higher education, which has been characterized by four foundational disciplines: African American, Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x, Native American and Indigenous, and Asian American studies.[4] The focus on the experiences of these four disciplines provides an opportunity for students to learn of the histories, cultures, struggles, and contributions to American society of these historically marginalized cultures which are often untold in U.S. history courses. Given California's diversity, the California Department of Education understands and knows that each community has its own ethnic make-up and each demographic group has its own unique history, struggles, and contributions to our state. Therefore, under the direction of State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, this model curriculum has been written to include information on the foundational disciplines in ethnic studies, and affords local educational agencies the flexibility to adapt the curriculum to address the demographics and diversity of the classroom . The adaptations should center on deepening or augmentingexpansion, rather than scaling down any of the four disciplines.
This model curriculum is a step to rectifying omission of the experiences and cultures of communities within California. includes the more complete telling of history. Ethnic studies courses address institutionalized systems of advantage, and address the causes of race within the context of how white dominated culture impacts racism and other forms of bigotry including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia within our culture and governmental policies. such as including anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Educators can create and utilize lessons rooted in the four foundational disciplines alongside the sample key themes of (1) Identity, (2) History and Movement, (3) Systems of Power, and (4) CivicSocial Movements and Equity to make connections to the experiences of all students .Students equipped with knowledge of the foundational disciplines and key themes should also apply research and analytical skills to examine the social, political, historical, economic, environmental, ethical, and other trends and influences in decision-making within their context and acquire the relevant civic knowledge and

Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview
Why Teach Ethnic Studies in a K�12 Environment?
Ethnic studies helps bring students and communities together. This does not mean glossing over differences, avoiding difficult issues, or resorting to clich�s about how we are all basically alike. It should do so by simultaneously doing three things: (1) addressing ethnic experiences and differences as real, and unique, and valuable; (2) building greater understanding and communication across ethnic experiences and differences; and (3) revealing underlying commonalities that can bind by bringing individuals and groups together; and (4) providing opportunities for students to address inequities through civic learning activities. Ethnic studies is designed to benefit all students. Christine Sleeter, Critical Education scholar, posits, "rather than being divisive, ethnic studies helps students to bridge differences that already exist in experiences and perspectives," highlighting that division is antithetical to ethnic studies. Her study of the research on ethnic studies outcomes found that instruction that includes diversity experiences and a specific focus on racism and other forms of bigotry has a positive impact in terms of "democracy outcomes" and higher-level thinking .[1]
Sleeter's research shows that culturally meaningful and relevant curriculum such as an ethnic studies course, which helps students develop the skillsets to engage in critical conversations about race, can have a positive impact on students. Research also shows that curricula that teach directly about racism have a stronger impact than curricula that portray diverse groups but ignore racism. Students that become more engaged in school through courses like ethnic studies are more likely to graduate and feel more personally empowered. By asking students to

examine and reflect on the history, struggles, and contributions of diverse groups within the context of racism and bigotry, ethnic studies should promote civic civic engagement with the goalscan foster the causes of equity and justice, by providing opportunities for students to impact public policies by engaging with local, state, and national policymakers.
Ethnic studies requires a commitment among its teachers to personal and professional development, deep content knowledge, socio-emotional learning, safe and healthy classroom management practices, and instructional strategies that develop higher-order thinking skills in children. It requires a commitment from the school community--parents, administrators, elected officials, and nonprofit partners--to support an ethnic studies program even when it challenges conventional ideals or prompts difficult conversations.
This model curriculum, therefore, is provided as only a small piece of a much larger set of resources necessary for a successful ethnic studies program.
Defining Ethnic Studies
The History Social-Science Framework for California Public Schools: Kindergarten through Grade 12 defines ethnic studies in the following passages:
"Ethnic studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses many subject areas including history, literature, economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science. It emerged to both address content considered missing from traditional curriculum and to encourage critical engagement.
"As a field, ethnic studies seeks to empower all students to engage socially and politically and to think critically about the world around them. It is important for ethnic studies courses to document the experiences of people of color in order for students to construct counter-narratives and develop a more complex understanding of the human experience. Through these studies, students should develop respect for cultural diversity and see the advantages of inclusion . "Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field, ethnic studies courses may take several forms. However, central to any ethnic studies course is the historic struggle of communities of color, taking into account the intersectionality of identity (gender, class,

sexuality, among others), to challenge racism, discrimination, and oppression and interrogate the systems that continue to perpetuate inequality ."
At its core, the field of ethnic studies is the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity, with an emphasis on the experiences of people of color in the United States. People or person of color is a term used primarily in the United States and is meant to be inclusive among non-white groups, emphasizing common experiences of racism. The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression that continue to have social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political impacts. It also deals with the often-overlooked contributions to many areas of government, politicas, the arts, medicine, economics, etc.social life made by people of color and provides examples of how collective social action can lead to a more equitable and just society can change society in positive ways.
Beyond providing an important history of groups underrepresented in traditional accounts and an analysis of oppression and power, ethnic studies offers a dynamic inquiry-based approach to the study of Native people and communities of color that encourages utilizing transnational and comparative frameworks. Thus, the themes and topics discussed within the field are boundless, such as a study of Mexican American texts, the implications of war and imperialism on Southeast Asian refugees, African American social movements and modes of resistance, and Native American/Indigenous cultural retentions, to name a few.
Furthermore, the field presents an opportunity for different cultures to be highlighted and studied in a manner that is meaningful and can be transformative for all students. Ethnic studies provides students with crucial interpersonal communication strategies, cultural competency, and equity driven skills (such as how to effectively listen to others, give people in need a voice, use shared power, be able to empathize, select relevant/effective change strategies, get feedback from those you are trying to help, know how to deliberate, know how to organize and build coalitions) and positive ways of expressing collective and collaborative power that are integral to effective and responsive civic engagement and collegiality, especially in a society that is rapidly diversifying .
The History of Ethnic Studies
The history and genealogy of ethnic studies can be traced back to the activism and intellectual thought of pioneers such as W.E.B. DuBois, Mary McLeod Bethune, Grace Lee Boggs, Rodolfo

Commented [27]: On the cusp of pointing to the need to support students for action for social and policy changes. Where and how frequently can we insert this?
Commented [28]: Then, we should call out how students should and can practice engaging with power structures to effect change. Can we put this in there? Commented [29]: why only "social life"- why not society, politics, government, the arts, medicine, economics, etc? Commented [30]: can lead to a more equitable and just society Commented [31]: Empowering young people to see themselves as both "contributors" and "leaders" in recognizing and promoting equity and justice through high quality civic engagement sets the groundwork for a lifetime of commitment to collective social action.
Commented [32]: Any thoughts on what this means? Should these be called out as civic engagement knowledge and skills as well? Commented [33]: maybe also something around how to use positive ways of expressing collective or collaborative power? Commented [34]: equity driven skills- how to effectively listen to others, give people in need a voice, use shared power, be able to empathize, select relevant/effective change strategies, get feedback from those you are trying to help, know how to deliberate, know how to organize and build coalitions?

Acu�a, Carter G. Woodson, Carlos Bulosan, Vine Deloria Jr., and Gloria Anzald�a. These scholars argued that the histories, perspectives, and contributions of those on the social, political, and economic margins--African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Chicanx/Latinx, and Native Americans--be included in mainstream history (as well as other traditional disciplines) to be able to better understand the past, envision new possibilities, and celebrate the nation's wealth of diversity.
By 1968, this call was crystallized as Black Student Union members at San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) began organizing around the issue. Soon after, they were joined by other students, culminating with a student strike. Inspired by youth activism and organizing in the Civil Rights, Black Liberation, American Indian, Chicano, Asian American, labor, and anti-Vietnam war movements, students at San Francisco State College embarked on a strike (November 6, 1968�March 20, 1969) demanding: (1) equal access to public education, (2) an increase in faculty of color, and (3) "a new curriculum that would embrace the history of all people, including ethnic minorities."[2] Led by the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF)--a coalition of students from the campus' Black Student Union, Latin American Student Organization (LASO), the Intercollegiate Chinese for Social Action (ICSA), the Mexican American Student Confederation, the Philippine American Collegiate Endeavor (PACE), La Raza, the Native American Students Organization, and Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA)--students refused to attend classes for five months until administrators met their demands.
In 1969 the first college of ethnic studies was established at San Francisco State University. Students were now able to take courses devoted to foregrounding the perspectives, histories, and cultures of African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Chicana/o/x/, Latina/o/x, and Native Americans. In early 1969, students at the University of California, Berkeley successfully launched a strike that resulted in the creation of one of the first ethnic studies departments. Meanwhile, at the other end of the state, as early as 1968 students at California State University, Los Angeles and California State University, Northridge were establishing Chicano studies and Black studies departments. Soon, college students across the nation began calling for the establishment of ethnic studies courses, departments, and degree programs. Over 50 years since the strike at San Francisco State College, ethnic studies is now a vibrant discipline with multiple academic journals, associations, national and international

conferences, undergraduate and graduate degree programs, and thousands of scholars and educators contributing to the field's complexity and vitality.

Since the student movements of the 1960s, ethnic studies proponents have fought for the inclusion of ethnic studies across public schools at the K�12 level and higher education. Over the last 10 years this movement has gained substantial traction at the local level as numerous California public school districts have either passed their own ethnic studies graduation requirements or are implementing ethnic studies courses.18

At the state level, the California State Legislature has drafted and voted on several bills to help bolster support for ethnic studies implementation at the K�12 level, including Assembly Bill 2016, which authorized the development of this document.

The Benefits of Ethnic Studies
In a 2011 report for the National Education Association entitled The Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies, Christine Sleeter stated that,
There is considerable research evidence that well-designed and well-taught ethnic studies curricula have positive academic and social outcomes for students. Curricula are designed and taught somewhat differently depending on the ethnic composition of the class or school and the subsequent experiences students bring, but both students of color and white students have been found to benefit from Ethnic studies.[3]

As the demographics continue to shift in California to an increasingly diverse population--for example, with Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x students comprising a majority in our public schools and students of two or more races comprising the fastest growing demographic group--there is a legitimate need to address the academic and social needs of such a population. All students should be better equipped with the knowledge and skills to successfully navigate our
increasingly diverse society.[4] Ethnic studies provides the space for all students and teachers
to begin having these conversations. Furthermore, ethnic studies scholars and classroom teachers established through research that courses in the field have:

Commented [36]: Would it be worthwhile to also talk about the education system's deliberate efforts to also reduce civics courses in the 60s? Basically, up until the 1960s, there used to be 3 civics courses in high schools and during the 1960s, it got reduced to be barely existent? That was an institutional decision in education, likely based on race and access. And, this is why we need to reverse course from those racist decisions in the 60s.

Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies

13

The following values and principles[13] [14]are central to guiding ethnic studies teaching and learning:
1. cultivate empathy, community actualization, cultural perpetuity[15], self-worth, selfdetermination, and the holistic well-being of all participants, especially Native People/s and people of color;
2. celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of color by providing a space to share their stories of struggle and resistance, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth;
3. center and place high value on the pre-colonial, ancestral knowledge[16] of Native people/s and people of color that is typically marginalized in society;
4. critique empire-building in history and its relationship to white supremacy, racism[17] and other forms of power and oppression
5. challenge imperialist/colonial[18] beliefs and practices on multiple levels[19] 6. connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for
social justice on the global and local levels to ensure a truer democracy; and 7. conceptualize, imagine, and identify build new possibilities for post-imperial life that
promotes collective narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radical healing, and take effective, practical, and appropriate informed action by applying their knowledge to make persuasive arguments and practice effecting social and policy
changes to realize those possibilities .[20]
Eight Outcomes of K�12 Ethnic Studies Teaching[21]
The following eight essential outcomes for ethnic studies teaching and learning are offered to assist with K�12 implementation of Ethnic Studies:
(1) Pursuit of justice and equity��Ethnic studies did not arise in a vacuum. It arose with the intent of giving voice to stories long silenced, including stories of injustice, marginalization, and discrimination, as well as stories of those who became part of our nation in different ways, such as through slavery, conquest, colonization, and immigration. Ethnic studies should address those experiences, including systemic racism[22], with both honesty and nuance, drawing upon
14

multiple perspectives. Ethnic studies should also examine individual and collective efforts to challenge and overcome inequality and discriminatory treatment, past and present.
The exploration of injustice and inequality should not merely unearth the past. ItStudents should also examine current social dynamics to identify create a better understanding of dissimilar and unequal ethnic trajectories, in order to take informed action strive for to foster a future of greater equity and inclusivity. In the pursuit of justice and equality, ethnic studies should help students comprehend the various manifestations of racism and other forms of ethnic bigotry, discrimination, and marginalization. It should also help students understand and practice the role that they can play individually and collectively in challenging these inequity-producing forces, such as systemic racism.
(2) Working toward greater inclusivity��The ethnic studies movement arose because of historical exclusion and pursued greater inclusion. California ethnic studies should emphasize educational equity by being inclusive of all students, regardless of their backgrounds. This means incorporating the experiences of a broad range of ethnic groups, while particularly clarifying the role of race and ethnicity in California and the United States. Yet, due to curricular time constraints, difficult choices will have to be made at the district and classroom level. While ethnic studies should address ethnicity in the broadest sense, it should devote special emphasis to the foundational disciplines while making connections to the varying experiences of all students.
(3) Furthering self-understanding��Through ethnic studies, students will gain a deeper understanding of their own identities, ancestral roots, and knowledge of self. Ethnic studies will help students better exercise their agency and become stronger self-advocates.
Not every student has a strong sense of ethnic identity. However, all students have an ethnic heritage (or heritages) rooted in the histories of their ancestors. Building from the concept of student-based inquiry, ethnic studies should provide an opportunity for all students to examine their own ethnic heritages. Increasing numbers of students have multiple ethnic heritages.
For example, this search can involve the exploration of students' own family histories. Through oral histories of family members and, where available, the use of family records, students can develop a better understanding of their place and the place of their ancestors in the ethnic trajectory of California and the United States. For students with non-English-speaking family

members, this would also provide an opportunity to develop research skills in multiple languages. However, educators should be sensitive to student and family privacy, while also recognizing that factors like adoption, divorce, and lack of access to family information may complicate this assignment for some students.
(4) Developing a better understanding of others��The essential and complementary flip-side of self-understanding is the understanding of others. Ethnic studies should not only help students explore their own backgrounds. It should also help build bridges of intergroup understanding.
This interethnic bridge-building can be furthered in various ways. Obviously, it can be enhanced by exposing students to a wide variety of voices, stories, experiences, and perspectives through materials featuring people of myriad ethnic backgrounds. But bridge-building can also occur through the classroom sharing of students' personal stories and family histories. In this way students can simultaneously learn to understand ethnic differences while also identifying underlying commonalities and personal challenges.
With mutual respect and dignity being emphasized, students will develop an appreciation for the complexity of diversity and how it continues to shape the American experience. Additionally, students will learn how to transform their appreciation of diversity into action that aims to build community and solidarity. High quality civic learning professional development and resources for teachers are instrumental in achieving this goal.
(5) Recognizing intersectionality��Ethnic studies focuses on the role of race and ethnicity. However, these are not the sole forces affecting personal identity, group identification, and the course of human experience. People, including students, are not only members of racial and ethnic groups. They also belong to many other types of social groups. These groups may be based on such factors as sex, religion, class, ability/disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship status, socioeconomic status, and language use.
For each individual, these multiple social categories converge in a unique way. That confluence of groups is sometimes called intersectionality. Those myriad categories influence, but do not necessarily determine, one's life trajectory. They also may influence how a person is perceived and treated by others, including both by individuals and by institutions. The inequitable

To some degree, each person's individuality and identity are the result of intersectionality. The lens of intersectionality helps both to explore the richness of human experience and to highlight the variations that exist within ethnic diversity. By highlighting intragroup variations, intersectionality can also help challenge group stereotyping and polarization.
(6) Promoting self-empowerment for civic engagement��Ethnic studies should help students become more engaged locally and develop into effective civic participants and stronger social justice advocates, better able to contribute to constructive social change. It can also help students connect current resistance movements to those of the past, and to imagine new possibilities for a true democracy. Since racism and other inequities are institutionalized through public policy, it is important for students to civically engage with policymakers to effectuate constructive change.The promotion of empowerment through ethnic studies can occur in various ways. It can help students become more astute in critically analyzing documents, historical events, and multiple perspectives. It can help students learn to discuss difficult issues, particularly when race and ethnicity are important factors. It can help students learn to present their ideas in strong, compelling, jargon-free language. It can help students assess various strategies for bringing about change. It can provide students with opportunities to experiment with different change strategies, while evaluating the strengths and limitations of each approach. In short, through ethnic studies students can develop civic participation skills, a greater sense of self-empowerment, and a deeper commitment to life-long civic engagement.
(7) Supporting a community focus��Ethnic studies in all California districts should address the basic contours of national and statewide ethnic experiences. This includes major events and phenomena that have shaped our diverse ethnic trajectories. However, individual school districts may also choose to enrich their approach to ethnic studies by also devoting special attention to ethnic groups that have been significantly present in their own communities.
By shaping ethnic studies to include a focus on local ethnic groups, districts can enhance learning opportunities through student-based inquiry into the local community. Such research can draw on multiple sources, such as local records, census material, survey results, memoirs, and media coverage. It can also involve oral history, providing voice for members of different ethnic communities and allowing students to engage multiple ethnic perspectives. This local

(8) Developing interpersonal communication��Achieving the preceding principles will require one additional capability: effective communication. Particularly considering California's extensive diversity, ethnic studies should help build effective communication across ethnic differences. This includes the ability to meet, discuss, and analyze sometimes controversial topics and issues that garner multiple diverse points of view. In other words, students should learn to participate in difficult dialogues. Further, students participating in Ethnic Studies will be equipped to analyze and critique contemporary issues and systems of power that impact their lived experiences and respective communities. They will engage in meaningful activities and assignments that encourage them to challenge the status quo through policy change as well as meaningful activities that empower the students to not simply encourage change and reimagine their futures.
Ethnic studies should help students learn to value and appreciate differences and each other's lived experiences as valuable assets in our diverse society in order to communicate more effectively and constructively with students of different varying backgrounds. It should help them develop the ability to communicate and interact with empathy, appreciation, empowerment and clarity, to interact with curiositycivility, to listen empathetically without judgementattentively, and to critically consider new ideas and perspectives. It should also encourage students to be willing to modify their positions in the light of new evidence and compelling insightsarguments. Students should not seek to dominatejust engage in conversations and debates, but rather practice a model of engagement which places a greater priority on listening, seeking to understand before than seeking to persuadeconvince.
Even the concepts ofterms "race" and "ethnicity" present challenges. What do they mean? How do they relate to each other? How were concepts of race, like "whiteness" and "blackness" constructed? How has our understanding of race and ethnicity that relationship changed over time? How are race and ethnicity as group identitiesis this relationship reflected in public documents, such as the U.S. Census and most formal applications? How do these group identifiers impact social connection and division? Ethnic studies should help students address these and other fundamental issues that complicate intergroup communication and understanding.

By operating on the basis of these eight principles, statewide ethnic studies can become a venue for developing a deeper understanding of the opportunities and challenges that come with ethnic diversity. It should advance the values cause of equity and inclusivity, challenge systemic racism, foster self-understanding and agency, build intergroup and intragroup bridges, enhance civic engagement, and further a sense of human commonality. In this way, ethnic studies can help re-elevate the importance of truth to build stronger communities, a more equitably inclusive state, and a more just nation.
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for K�12 Education
The current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum serves as a guide to school districts that would like to either develop and implement stand-alone courses or integrate the concepts and principles of ethnic studies into current social science or English language arts courses. With time and support, a more robust guide could help integrate Ethnic Studies into other courses, such as Math and Science. It is divided into chapters and appendices:
� Chapter 2 provides guidance to district and site administrators on teacher, student, and community involvement in the development of these courses.
� Chapter 3 provides instructional guidance for veteran and new teachers of ethnic studies content.
� Chapter 4 of the document is a bibliography to assist the local school district and committees to further inform their discussion on ethnic studies.
� Appendix A provides examples of courses approved by the University of California Office of the President as meeting A�G requirements.
� Appendix B provides a collection of guiding questions, sample lessons and topics for ethnic studies courses.
� Appendix C provides links to instructional resources to assist educators in facilitating conversations about race, racism, bigotry, and the experiences of diverse Americans.

Chapter 2: District Implementation Guidance
Key Considerations for District and Site Administrators
While effective teaching of ethnic studies is paramount, a supportive district and site leadership is just as important to the efficacy of the work. District and site administrators should also work to develop their understandings of ethnic studies instruction and pedagogies. Below are ways districts can work to best support the development and implementation of a kindergarten through grade twelve (K�12) ethnic studies program, whether it utilizes a stand-alone, integrated or a thematic approach:
 Ensure that district and site administration support the development of the program, and that the local governing board is fully briefed on the project. District support is critical to the successful implementation of any new instructional program.
 Develop a definition of what ethnic studies means to your district. The purpose statement in the "Developing an Ethnic Studies Pedagogy for K�12 Education" section in chapter 3 notes the importance of connecting the local district and community needs to the historical field of study.

�

Ensure alignment of the district course(s) to state and local policy, district resources, and

community needs. Determine the type of program that is being implemented. Is this a semester

or year-long course? Will the course be a standalone ethnic studies course, or will an existing

course be modified to incorporate ethnic studies content, skills, and principles? Which

department or departments will house ethnic studies? Will a separate ethnic studies PLC be

formed to include teachers from multiple disciplines and academic backgrounds? As you make

these determinations, you may also consider how many courses are going to be offered,

existing courses that offer opportunities to teach ethnic studies content and lessons, the

expectations for student enrollment, how the program will be accommodated within local

facilities, and how many teachers will be needed.

� Consider the local history, demographics and particular needs of your district/site's students and their respective communities, including recognition of the Indigenous Peoples wherever a course is being taught. Administrators should consider conducting research on the cultural values, traditions, indigeneity, and histories of the diverse populations represented in schools. Evaluate the demographic makeup of the district. What is the ethnic breakdown of the student population? Does the district have large volumes of English learners? Students who come from socioeconomically challenged backgrounds? How can this program serve the needs of those students? How can the value of and empathy for other marginalized groups be fostered when student populations are homogenous and/or haven't been explicitly or formally exposed to concepts of race and ethnicity? This research can be done by delving into reported student data, consulting student families and community stakeholders about pressing issues and concerns facing these communities, or even inviting scholars specialized in the history of the communities represented in the district.

� Develop a clear funding model that includes the resources available for the program and how those resources will be allocated (e.g., teacher training, classrooms, administrative support, purchase of instructional materials) and add LCAP language in support of and in relation to positive impacts and in relation to civic engagement.
 Be grounded and well-versed in the purpose and impact of ethnic studies. Similar to ethnic studies educators, administrators should also familiarize themselves with research on the efficacy of K�12 ethnic studies--from developing strong cultural and academic identity, building academic skills within elementary, middle, and high school teachers, to facilitating civic engagement with a service and problem-solving orientation.

Again, the bibliography included in this document can be used as a starting point. Furthermore, administrators should work to weave the purpose, benefits, principles, and impact of ethnic studies into the fabric of the school, and as a means to educate parents and the broader community. Administrators should familiarize themselves with the ethnic studies guiding values and outcomes outlined in Chapter 1, and keep them in mind as they implement an ethnic studies program.  Identify teachers who are willing and committed to invest in developing an ethnic studies curriculum and pedagogy. Administrators should work within the district and site departments to identify teachers with backgrounds in ethnic studies or strong interest in teaching in the area, who will be involved in the development and implementation of the program. It is especially important to establish connections between the new program and existing offerings in history�social science and English/language arts while ensuring that civic learning instructional practices (such as facilitating for student inquiry, investigation, civil dialogue, and informed action) are included to allow student access to the State Seal of Civic Engagement. Additionally, ethnic studies can be integrated into existing courses in addition to, or instead of, creating a standalone ethnic studies course. Teachers and departments should be provided time to incorporate ethnic studies content and principles into existing curricula and be provided with access to professional development as appropriate, including leveraging university ethnic studies curriculum that have existed for decades. Conducting inner-district outreach campaigns, and exploring the possibility of developing ethnic studies teachers from the ranks of paraprofessionals and other support staff, are just two ways administrators can work to recruit and develop ethnic studies teachers. Additionally, administrators can work with local teacher education programs and university ethnic studies departments to actively recruit and develop a pipeline for individuals interested in teaching ethnic studies.  Develop, implement, monitor, and evaluate instructional support. In order for teachers to provide a robust ethnic studies learning experience they should be engaged in continual professional development (inclusive of professional development on civic and governance structures and process), and supported by their site and district administrators who are working in tandem with students and community. Administrators should consider creating a department or distinct lane of work specifically dedicated to developing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating ethnic studies instructional materials and professional development (preferably differentiated professional development trainings specifically based on varying levels of ethnic studies content

knowledge). Administrators can develop their own models of ethnic studies professional development and/or instructional materials by consulting other districts with wellestablished ethnic studies departments and teachers. It is imperative to consider the number of teachers who currently have experience in this subject area and those who will need additional support and professional development prior to implementation. Furthermore, administrators can draw upon the expertise of scholars to help create this tailored training .

� Consult with other districts and higher education institutions that have implemented ethnic studies programs, to see if there are other models and resources that can be adapted to the local program. Appendix A contains a selection of course descriptions from various districts across the state; listings of other courses can be found at the University of California's A�G Course Management Portal at https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/.

� Consult with the local county office of education. Your local county office of education may provide consultation, resources, and/or professional development activities to support the development and implementation of the ethnic studies program.

� Develop a comprehensive strategic plan for implementation, including an initial pilot that will enable the district to gather data about what works and doesn't work about the new program. One option is to pilot the course as a semester course, and then expand it to a full-year course as capacity is developed within the district. Utilize a subcommittee, preferably including the teachers who will be teaching the course(s), to select instructional materials for the pilot. Alternatively, the course could be piloted by modifying an existing course so that it is taught using an ethnic studies lens. Conduct the pilot, providing frequent opportunities for participating teachers to collaborate and provide feedback both to each other and to district and site administration. Finally, provide opportunities for students to provide feedback and use assessment tools to quantify the areas that need improvement. The district may utilize the pilot as an opportunity to develop new lessons, resources, activities, and assessments that can be used in the program moving forward.

Guide to Developing a Local Curriculum with Ethnic Studies Principles
When developing a local curriculum, the first step is to assemble a team to do the work. These team members should have appropriate professional training on curriculum development. Teachers with an ethnic studies background who will be implementing the curriculum should take the lead on this process, but it should also include teachers from other content areas. Ethnic studies is by its very nature interdisciplinary, and ethnic studies teachers can collaborate with history�social science teachers, teachers in language arts, visual and performing arts, and other subjects as well, while including civic learning across all disciplines. This collaboration will help to ensure that the curriculum is aligned to the skill expectations in the state's history�social science and language arts content standards, but beyond that, it can help to ensure that the concepts and principles of ethnic studies and civic engagement are present throughout the curriculum and are not just limited to the ethnic studies classroom. For example, the pursuit of justice and equity is not only something that students practice in the classroom, but a skill that they develop for use in later life as empowered civic participants citizens and proponents who can promote for social change today. Schools and administrators should also develop a process for evaluation of courses developed and supported through high quality ethnic studies professional learning.
Administrative support is also essential to the successful implementation of a new curriculum, as teacher training and other opportunities for professional learning should be incorporated into the curriculum plan. This will help ensure that future teachers will be equipped with the necessary skills, content knowledge and critical mindsets, and be able to refine the curriculum long after its initial development. It should also be acknowledged that there will be districts that may be undertaking this process for the first time without experienced teachers who are trained in ethnic studies and civic learning content and pedagogy. In those cases, it will be particularly important for administrators to support their teachers in order to ensure that they are sufficiently prepared to implement a successful ethnic studies program. Further, following the development and adoption process in the school district, having a process in place to include opportunities for the continual development and refinement of the curriculum after its initial development is beneficial.

Commented [63]: Could civics be included here?
Commented [64]: Does this assume students cannot effect for social change while in the classroom? How can we re-frame for both ...and...?

26

It is also important to engage students and the community in the curriculum development process. Student participation during the curriculum development process is integral to the effectiveness of ethnic studies curriculum. That participation should begin at the school level.
In order to develop a curriculum that is culturally and community relevant and responsive, teachers and administrators need to be familiar with both their student population and their communities. Chapter 1 of this model curriculum stresses the importance of these connections in order to accomplish the goals of ethnic studies in the classroom. The team developing the curriculum must not consider their work complete because they have developed a curriculum that addresses the races/ethnicities on a demographic report. They must seek to understand how the prior life lived experiences of their student population affect the knowledge and attitudes that they bring to the classroom and that students have just as much to bring to the table for mutual learning. With that knowledge in hand, it will be easier to develop a curriculum that will engages students as peer learners and with mutual speak to them in a way that they can understanding and appreciationappreciate.
The curriculum frameworks adopted by the State Board of Education (SBE) contain information that can guide teachers and administrators in the development of a local curriculum. In particular, the History�Social Science Framework, and the English Language Arts/English Language Development Framework contain useful guidance for current or potential teachers of ethnic studies. Both frameworks contain chapters on assessment that include specific direction on how to use formative and summative assessments to plan and implement an instructional program. They also include chapters on access and equity that emphasize the importance of designing curriculum to support all students, including those who have special needs. The State Seal of Civic Engagement Roadmap also provides guiding principles for integrating civic learning, across discipline instructional practices, and promising practices in class, inschool/out-of-school, and on-line. One approach for how to differentiate instruction to address those needs is Universal Design for Learning (UDL), a set of strategies for planning instruction and presenting content that enables students to access and use disciplinary knowledge in a variety of ways that address their needs, assets, and strengths.[1] Finally, the frameworks include chapters on instructional strategies and professional learning that provide guidance for both teachers and administrators in planning, implementing, and supporting an inquiry-based instructional program that supports student engagement with the curriculum.

Commented [65]: I worry about giving too much of the burden on teachers to arrive at developing the curriculum, and less about how teachers can facilitate for students to co-develop or lead the development through student research. The concept of democratic teaching needs to be more emphasized through out.
Commented [66]: Maybe add note that teachers should also point out to the different ways students can effect change? ...and give them opportunities to practice?

27

The History�Social Science Framework is of particular importance and should be considered an essential companion document to this model curriculum for current and prospective ethnic studies teachers. The framework was organized around four key instructional shifts: inquiry, literacy, content, and citizenship, where citizenship preparation entails fostering student civil dialogue and informed action. These shifts are strongly aligned with the core principles of ethnic studies as a discipline. The framework contains a suggested elective course in ethnic studies designed to be used as a history�social science elective in grade nine.[2] This model curriculum obviously goes into much more detail, but the framework relies upon a similar instructional approach, presenting essential questions to direct student inquiry, classroom examples, and suggestions for ways that students can participate in service learning or activism in their school or local community.
Integrating Stakeholders and Community
With the field of ethnic studies being born out of a grassroots community movement, community partnership and accountability are central to its identity. By design, ethnic studies seeks to be community accountable and responsive. Districts and sites considering offering ethnic studies should include students, families and other public/community institutions (museums, community art spaces, local non-profits relevant to the field, grassroots/community advocacy organizations, etc.) in those plans and discussions to ensure that the particular histories, aspirations, struggles and achievement of the communities present in classrooms are reflected in the course. One option would be to create a steering committee that could include district teachers and administrators, students, parents, and members of community and advocacy organizations that are active in the district area. Provide multiple opportunities for the public to provide comment on the proposed program during the development process. Student participation in servicelearning activities or other project based learning opportunities, including work based learning opportunities, may facilitate deeper student understanding and application of their newly acquired knowledge and may serve as a way of confirming community support and addressing concerns during the implementation of the program.
Selecting Existing Curricula and Instructional Materials
Local educational agencies (LEAs) have a great deal of flexibility when it comes to the selection of instructional materials for use in their schools. Education Code Section 60000(c) states that it

is the responsibility of an LEA's governing board to establish courses of study and to select the appropriate instructional materials for those courses. While there is a state-level process by which the SBE adopts instructional materials, that process only applies to kindergarten through grade eight materials. High school materials, including materials for elective courses such as ethnic studies, are adopted at the local level by the LEA governing board (Education Code Section 60400).
LEAs are required to adopt materials that meet certain requirements in code, such as the requirement that instructional materials "accurately portray the cultural and racial diversity of our society" (Education Code Section 60040). However, the process by which materials are selected at the local level varies significantly. Most LEAs have policies that govern this process. Typically, the process begins when a local selection committee is chosen. Education Code Section 60002 states that, "Each district board shall provide for substantial teacher involvement in the selection of instructional materials and shall promote the involvement of parents and other members of the community in the selection of instructional materials." But how exactly that involvement is carried out depends on the LEA. Another way to honor the principles of ethnic studies is to have students be involved in this process as well, either through direct involvement in district policy development or through community outreach to engage others in the selection process.
Governing boards should make these decisions through an open and public process that provides for public input and teacher leadership throughout the process. It is important that all steps related to the development of a local curriculum, including the selection of materials, are transparent and involve all stakeholders in the community. This process can be time-consuming and difficult, but it is the best way to ensure that the materials used are high quality and support effective instruction and student learning.
The SBE has adopted a policy document that provides a set of guidelines for piloting textbooks and instructional materials.[3] While focused on kindergarten through grade eight, much of the guidance in the document applies to the selection of materials for the secondary grades as well. These guidelines include tasks such as the creation of a representative selection committee, the definition and prioritization of evaluation criteria, and establishing a pilot process to determine which available materials best meet local needs. The curriculum frameworks adopted by the

Developing an Ethnic Studies Pedagogy for K�12 Education
Ethnic studies teaching is grounded in the belief that education can be a tool for transformation,
social, economic, and political change, and liberation.[1] Central to an ethnic studies pedagogy
is the goal to develop students to be able to effectively and powerfully read, write, speak, and think critically, and engage in school and society in meaningful ways. To achieve these goals, ethnic studies educators should consider the following five elements as part of their pedagogical practice: purpose, identity, content and skills, context, and methods. Teaching ethnic studies necessitates that educators consider the purpose of ethnic studies, the context in which the course is being taught, and even a reflection on how the educator's identity and potential biases impact their understanding of and outlook on the world.
Purpose
It is essential that ethnic studies educators first reflect upon the purpose of the field, and the specific course at hand, before arriving at their pedagogical approach. Historically, the

educational and academic purpose of ethnic studies has centered on three core concepts:
access, relevance, and community.[2]
 Access- Ethnic studies provides all students the opportunity to engage with ethnic studies materials and content within their classrooms. They will be exposed to a diverse curriculum and rich teaching that is both meaningful and supportive.
 Relevance- Ethnic studies provides students with an education that is both culturally and community relevant, and draws extensively from the lived experiences and material realities of each individual student.
 Community- Ethnic studies teaching and learning is meant to serve as a bridge between educational spaces/institutions and community. Thus, encouraging students to apply use their knowledge to practice being become agents of change, social justice organizers and advocates, and engaged global citizens at the local, state, national, and global levels.

Reflecting on these concepts at the onset will ensure that ethnic studies educators are creating content and a pedagogical praxis that is grounded in both the field's purpose and aforementioned values and outcomes. Dawn Mabalon provides the following essential questions that guide the purpose of ethnic studies: (1) Who am I? (2) Who is my family and community? (3) What can I do to bring positive change to my community and world ?
Identity
Before embarking on lesson planning for an ethnic studies course, it is important that ethnic studies educators are aware of how their own identities, implicit biases, and cultural awareness responsiveness may impact ethnic studies teaching and learning. With much of the field focusing on issues related to race and identity, teachers, especially those with limited ethnic studies knowledge, should engage in activities that allow them to unpack their own identities, privilege, marginalization, lived experiences, and understanding and experience of race, culture, and social justice. For teachers who may feel especially concerned with teaching ethnic studies, leading ethnic studies scholars highly recommend that they work through assignments like critical autobiography, critical storytelling, critical life history, or keeping a subjectivity journal, to
begin the process of "constructively situating oneself in relationship to Ethnic Studies".[3]

Additionally, unlike traditional fields, ethnic studies often requires both students and educators to be vulnerable with each other given the range of topics discussed throughout the course. Thus, educators should work to build community within their classrooms, be comfortable with sharing pieces of their own identities and lived experience, and be equipped to holistically navigate and respond to students' concerns, discussions, and emotions. Educators should also recognize view student lived experiences as assets, that they themselves maywill not always have the answers, and therefore, should seek opportunitiesbe open to learning from their students and createing room for teachable moments.
This is also true when incorporating literature in an ethnic studies course. Students need to see themselves represented as empowered individuals and experience a diverse range of complex stories to help them understand themselves, as individuals and as members of group identity, and the lived experiences of others different from them. Studies have shown that large majorities of books published for children and young adults feature white characters.[4] When characters of color or other marginalized groups, such as LGBTQ+, do appear, they are often portrayed as stereotypes or exist at the fringes of the story. Scholar and author Ebony Elizabeth Thomas warns that this exclusion is creating an "imagination gap" where children are growing up without experiencing what Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop described as the "windows, mirrors, and doors" of literature: "Books are sometimes windows, offering views of worlds that may be real or imagined, familiar or strange. These windows are also sliding glass doors, and readers have only to walk through in imagination to become part of whatever world has been created and recreated by the author. When lighting conditions are just right, however, a window can also be a mirror. Literature transforms human experience and reflects it back to us, and in that reflection, we can see our own lives and experiences as part of the larger human experience. Reading, then, becomes a means of self-affirmation, and readers often seek their mirrors in books."[5] By centering the voices that have been traditionally marginalized or excluded from the curriculum and applying a critical lens to texts, teachers provide opportunities to develop students' critical literacy skills, while also allowing them to see themselves in the literature they read and expand the range of stories that they have about others in the world.
Content and Skills
With ethnic studies drawing on a range of academic disciplines from history and performing arts to sociology and literature, the expectation is that students should be are introduced to an array of academically rigorous content and skills that are simultaneously grounded in the
34

Commented [75]: Feels excessive and could be summarized by keeping the last two sentences

contributions, lived experiences, and histories of people of color. Students should be exposed to a variety of primary and secondary sources, learn how to process multiple and often competing sources of information, form and defend their own evidence-based analyses, and understand how to appropriately contextualize and evaluate sources of information by bringing them into conversation with other texts, significant events, people, theories, and ideas. Teachers should be able to facilitate student civil discourse on controversial issues and support students to identify strategies and opportunities to practice affecting current social and policy changes.
For additional support on identifying a multitude of sources that can be used in the classroom, ethnic studies educators should consult the University of California ethnic studies course outlines that are included in Appendix A of this document, collaborate with other teachers at their sites, and engage materials that can be found at local and community archives and libraries, especially those housed by the University of California, California State University, and local community colleges.
Context
Beyond content, it is important that ethnic studies educators are knowledgeable of the context in which the course is being taught. Here are some dynamics an ethnic studies educator might consider:
 Is the course being taught in a district where parents or community members are unfamiliar with the field?
 Is the course being taught in a school with a widening opportunity gap?  How comfortable and/or experienced are students with explicitly discussing race and
ethnicity?  IsOr perhaps the course is being taught during a moment where racial tensions at the
local and national level are beginning to impact students?
These are just a few of the contextual factors that ethnic studies educators must consider as they develop their pedagogical practice.
While being aware of these dynamics is important, working to address them within the course is also key. For example, an ethnic studies educator might create a lesson around education inequality and the opportunity gap that gets students to reflect upon the many factors that have

contributed to disparate student success across racial and class lines. Students could analyze "student success", "college readiness", and standardized test data from their district or others across the state, read case studies that identify some of the key factors that contribute to student success, and reflect upon their own experiences, drawing connections to collected data or scholarly analyses, if any. A critical part of the context of ethnic studies is being aware ofa sensitivity and anticipatingpreparedness for when negativedifferent emotions and/or traumas arise from students in dealing with potentially difficult content or materials�having training with this and resources of further support (including school site counselors when needed), is key.
Methods
There are various methods or pedagogical approaches that ethnic studies educators should consider, from culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogy to the important instructional shifts described in the California History�Social Science Framework and the English Language Arts/English Language Development Framework.
Inquiry
An inquiry-based approach to ethnic studies invites students to become active participants in the learning process. Students are encouraged to pose questions, investigate and explore academic content, and research and theorize solutions to problems that have and continue to generate inequities and racial tensions. This approach is inherently student-centered and helps democratize the classroom by allowing students to help shape their education. Thus, the role of a teacher in an inquiry-based classroom is more of a facilitator that helps students formulate questions, conduct research, and come to their own conclusions/solutions. Researchers found that this approach has yielded student achievement gains/narrowed the opportunity gap (especially amongst historically marginalized students), increased proficiency amongst English language learners, and provides a framework for teachers that might not share the same
identities of their students to best engage underrepresented students.[6] This approach of
ensuring that students investigate and interrogatecritically engage with content is paramount to the ethnic studies course.
In practice, a teacher employing an inquiry-based approach to ethnic studies might frame the course description around a question like--how have race and ethnicity been constructed in the United States, and how have they changed over time? While broad, this question allows for

students to be able to enter the course from various points. This approach encourages the use of lessons grounded in research and academic content. Getting students to engage primary sources, develop youth-participatory action research (Youth-led Participatory Action Research (YPAR) projects, or create service-learning projects are just a few examples of how an inquirybased approach encourages students to become engaged actors within the learning process.
Democratizing the Classroom and Citizenship
Ethnic studies educators democratize their classrooms by creating a learning environment where both students and teachers are equal active participants in co-constructing and applying knowledge. This enables students to be recognized and valued as knowledge producers alongside their educators, while simultaneously placing an emphasis on the development of democratic values and collegiality.
This approach to ethnic studies teaching is also echoed in the California History�Social Science Framework's underscoring of citizenship as one of the "four important instructional shifts." -citizenship, which is needed to prepare all members of American society, regardless of citizenship status, to become civically engaged in our democratic society. Having students research a challenge facing their community, engagement with local elected officials, advocates, and community members, structured debate, simulations of government, or service learning, are all citizenship-civic-oriented skills that are best developed in a classroom where students are able to exercise their agency. Furthermore, these types of activities are appropriate for an ethnic studies course as they provide a lens for students to identify institutional/structural inequities, advocate for change at the local, state, national, or international level, and to engage in healthy debate and dialogue with their peers.
It will often be appropriate for eEthnic studies courses should to include a civic or community engagement project that allows for students to use their knowledge and voice to affect social transformation in their community. Teachers can utilize programs (e.g., YPAR, Constitutional Rights Foundation's Civic Action Project, Center for Civic Education's Project Citizen, California Democracy School Project, Mikva Challenge Action Civics, Generation Citizen, Integrated Action Civics Model, Literacy & The Law and other programs on CDE's website for Resources for Civic Engagement - https://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ca/hs/civicengprojects.asp) that assist students in collecting data, identifying issues, root causes and implementing a plan to better their environment by working with policymakers at all levels (e.g., YPAR, Constitutional Rights
37

Foundation's Civic Action Project, Center for Civic Education's Project Citizen, California Democracy School Project, Mikva Challenge Action Civics, Generation Citizen, Integrated Action Civics Model). For example, if students decide they want to advocate for increasing the number of polling places within historically underrepresented communities in their city, they can research and debate the issue to surface the pros and cons of the idea, develop arguments in favor and then plan a meeting with their county registrar of voters to advocate for the change. To be convincing they must do in-depth research on how other counties have achieved this change, demographic data, leading counterarguments, past voting data, etc. and then developplan their persuasive speeches or talking points to advocate for the change. This experience can be powerful and transformational in that it instills a sense of civic efficacy and empowerment in youth that they will carry on throughout their lives.
This emphasis on building citizenship competencies within the pedagogy provides students with a keen sense of ethics, respect, and appreciation for all people, regardless of ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, ability, religion, and beliefs. By democratizing the classroom, educators are allowing multiple entry points for students to discuss ethnic studies theories like, intersectionality--an analytic framework coined by Black feminist legal scholar, Kimberl� Crenshaw, that captures how multiple identities (race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, etc.) overlap or intersect, creating unique experiences, especially for those navigating multiple
marginalized or oppressed identities.[7] Intersectionality helps students better understand the
nuances around identity, and provides them with skills to be able to engage and advocate for/with communities on the margins of the margins. Further, it helps those with privilege at different intersections recognize their societal advantages in these areas, and build solidarity with oppressed groups.
ReinforcingStressing Literacy
Ethnic studies, like all areas within the social sciences, is a literate discipline. Students should learn the skills necessary to access informational, scholarly, and literary texts. Moreover, they should be able to think critically and analytically, and express themselves through strong verbal and written communication (expository writing). These skills are integral to students' ability to grasp and master content, engage in inquiry, and be active and well-informed participants in society. The specific grade-level skills that students should develop in their high school careers are described in the History�Social Science Content Standards, specifically the Historical and
38

Social Sciences Analysis Skills, and in the California Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy, including the writing and reading standards for history/social studies.
To further develop students' literacy skills, ethnic studies educators should consider including literature or other language arts-based texts into their courses, which also speak to some of the principles of ethnic studies. For example, including poems, plays, or literature, like the writings of Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, or dramas produced by El Teatro Campesino. These texts allow for teachers to discuss the literary, poetic, and theatrical devices of these works, while simultaneously highlighting the history of the Harlem Renaissance, and the dramas and cultural production of the Chicano and United Farm Workers movements. The infusion of cultural and more ethnic studies-based texts also allows for students to see themselves reflected in the curriculum, and to be inspired to promote and usher inimagine a better world through their actions.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the English Language Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) Framework:
These two curriculum frameworks contain an extensive lesson example that shows how teachers can work with colleagues across disciplines to address a common topic. In this case, the example is how a language arts teacher and history�social science teacher collaborate to teach the novel Things Fall Apart, addressing both language arts and history�social science standards in their instruction (the example begins on page 338 in the History�Social Science Framework, and page 744 of the ELA/ELD Framework).
Ethnic studies educators should also consider how they can collaborate with their peers to integrate ethnic studies instruction with content in other areas. Depending on which grade level the ethnic studies course is being offered, the ethnic studies educator can include a literary selection that connects to the content students are studying in their history�social science classroom, or work with the language arts teacher on lessons that address grade-level standards in reading or writing.
Culturally/Community Relevant and Responsive- Ethnic studies educators should be sure that their pedagogy is both community and culturally relevant.

experiences as important assets and resources to collective learning, are is also important to
ethnic studies teaching and learning.[8] While much of being able to develop a culturally-
responsive pedagogy is about the relationships teachers build with their students, operating from a holistic and motivational space, tailoring lessons and assignments to speak to the needs and cultural experiences of students, and staying abreast of research, trends, and issues that
speak to the various cultures of students is also key.[9] Furthermore, ethnic studies educators
should continually inquire and reflect stay abreast on the of challenges impacting their students' communities, and leverage ethnic studies courses to implement and spur discussions,
assignments, and community-engaged projects around those issues and/or topics.[10]
In-Class Community Building
Given the unique and often sensitive material and discussions that may unfold in an ethnic studies course, being able to establish trust and building community within the classroom are essential. Engaging topics on race, class, gender, oppression, etc., may evoke feelings of vulnerability, uneasiness, sadness, guilt, helplessness, or discomfort, for students not previously exposed to explicit conversations about these topics especially amongst students from historically marginalized backgrounds. Thus, it is imperative for ethnic studies educators to develop a pedagogy and classroom that (1) sees the humanity and value in each individual student, (2) recognizes that each student has their own wealth of experiences and knowledge that will shape their worldviews and values, and diverse viewpoints are respected, (3) is grounded in academic rigor, but also tends to the socioemotional development of students, (4) encourages students to engage each other with respect, trust, love, and accountability, and (5) is a space where learning is democratized and students are centered through an inquiry-based process that nurtures the student voice and honors different styles of learning, and. (6) supports application of learning by empowering students with the knowledge and skills needed to take informed action to address social, economic, and political inequities.
Ethnic studies educators are encouraged to establish community agreements or classroom norms in collaboration with their students where empathetic listening is prioritized and conflicting views are valued as opportunities for deeper learning, incorporate community building activities into lessons, and create time for regular reflection and debrief. Incorporating these
40

recommendations can assist in building a welcoming environment where students are able to rigorously and intimately engage ethnic studies and build upon existing interpersonal communication and collaboration skills.
Educators today have a tremendous responsibility to students: teaching content, cultivating their social�emotional skills, and preparing them to be informed, responsible, and actively engaged global citizens. "In reflective classrooms, students' knowledge is constructed and applied rather than passively absorbed. Students are prompted to join with teachers in posing and addressing problems to foster `critical consciousness' (Freire, 1994). In reflective classrooms, teaching and learning are conceived as social endeavors in which a healthy exchange of ideas is welcome. Students are encouraged to engage in dialogue within a community of learners, to look deeply, to question underlying assumptions, and to discern underlying values being presented. Students are encouraged to voice their own opinions and to actively listen to others, to treat different students and different perspectives with patience and respect, and to recognize that there are always more perspectives and more to learn. Learning in these contexts nurtures students' humility as well as confidence - humility because they come to see that they have no `corner' on the truth, and confidence because they know their opinion will still be taken seriously."[11]
Building "safe," "brave," "democratic," "empowering" classrooms is both art and science. Skilled teachers use a variety of techniques to create a sense of trust and openness, to encourage students to speak and listen to each other, to make space and time for silent reflection, to offer multiple avenues for participation and learning, and to help students appreciate the points of view, talents, and contributions of less vocal members.
Facilitating thoughtful, respectful, and generative discussions of controversial issues can be especially challenging in classrooms where students bring a diversity of social, personal, cultural, and academic backgrounds, mindsets, and experiences to the conversation. Yet the richness of these discussions and their importance for future citizenship drives many teachers whose classes are relatively homogeneous to seek out opportunities for their students to engage with counterparts of very different backgrounds.
It is equally difficult challenging to consistently facilitate honest or insightful dialogue in classrooms where there is a greater degree of social, personal, economic and/or political homogeneity. By prioritizing student-centered approaches and utilizing a wide variety of discussion protocols, (e.g. structured academic controversy, Socratic Seminars, philosophical

What do teachers need in order to effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues? Simply put:
 Sufficient understanding of the subject matter to provide basic context and select a set of authentic and varied readings, coupled with genuine curiosity and an awareness of the limitations of their knowledge
 Knowledge of their students' backgrounds and the ability to elicit students' questions and perspectives, monitor their understanding, push them to think critically, and help them appreciate their insights, wisdom, and moral courage of themselves and others.

Commented [90]: Can we change the metaphor from one of militarism to something more productive? e.g. Anticipatory schema of challenges...

To become effective educators, teachers first need the time and opportunity to reflect together with colleagues. Providing professional development seminars and workshops which specifically create time for teachers to be learners, allows them to explore core concepts and to deepen their understanding of the history they intend to teach while simultaneously exploring their own identity, the way their identity has affected and been affected by their experiences, and how their identity influences their perspective and the way they are seen by others, including their students. In community with other educators, teachers gain insight from others' experiences and perspectives, and build relationships for ongoing exploration which may be useful as they then create reflective communities for their students. There is a wide range of existing activities that teachers can use to support community building in their classrooms. Please see Appendix C for lessons resources including community building activity examples.
Approaches to Ethnic Studies

42

The History�Social Science Framework for California Public Schools: Kindergarten through Grade Twelve offers the following guidance for schools and educators on the teaching of ethnic studies focusing on two essential questions:
� How have race and ethnicity been constructed in the United States, and how have they changed over time?
� How do race and ethnicity continue to shape the United States and contemporary issues?
When the discipline was first founded, "ethnic studies" was (and still is) deployed as an umbrella term/field that was designed to be inclusive of four core fields--African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies, and Native American Studies. While each core field addresses the specific histories, and social, cultural, economic, and political experiences of people from said group, they often overlap in their approach, the types of methods and theories that are engaged, and through discussion of shared/collective struggles. The approaches found in these examples can also be applied to the study of other diverse groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, beliefs, and other identifiers that help to affirm a student's sense of self.
With such disciplinary diversity, ethnic studies has been approached utilizing various instructional formats at the K�12 level. The most common are stand-alone core field courses, thematic/comparative race and ethnic studies courses, and the integration of ethnic studies content into existing content.
Like all successful instruction, teaching ethnic studies requires effective professional learning and preparation, depth of knowledge, belief in students as capable learners, as well as strong institutional support. Drawing on lessons from San Francisco Unified School District's (SFUSD) effort to build its ethnic studies program, districts are encouraged to support their teachers' development in three key areas:
Useful Theory, Pedagogy, and Research
Teachers and administrators should begin with a careful, deliberate analysis of their own personal identities, backgrounds, knowledge base, and biases. They should familiarize themselves with current scholarly research around ethnic studies instruction, critical and culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies, critical race theory, and
43

intersectionality, which are key theoretical frameworks and pedagogies that can be used in ethnic studies research and instruction. Engagement with theory and scholarly research can help strengthen educators' ability to distinguish between root causes and symptoms, dispel myth from fact, and address the importance of discussing and addressing lasting issues caused by systemic inequities. Attention should also be given to trauma-informed and healing informed educational practices. The bibliography included in this document can be used as a springboard. However, it is strongly encouraged that both educators and administrators consult ethnic studies coordinators at the district level and county level, ethnic studies classroom teachers offering professional development offered by ethnic studies classroom teachers, county offices of education, , and faculty at Institutions of Higher Education, and other support providers. These sources, contacts, and institutions can help educators and administrators stay abreast of useful theory, research, and content knowledge that can be leveraged in the classroom and/or professional development.
Ethnic Studies Content
In Ronald Takaki's seminal text, A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America, he articulates the need for a new "looking glass" from which our society must gaze. He argues that within our national narrative all communities must be able to see themselves. Thus, it is vital for teachers to engage a multitude of stories, narratives, sources, and contributions of everyone in America so that all students can see themselves as part and parcel of the grand American narrative.
Teachers should engage various texts and perspectives when teaching ethnic studies; be open to learning from their students; consider allowing students to offer suggested texts or sources that may speak to the specificities of their individual identities; and in addition to consulting other teachers, ethnic studies coordinators, and higher education faculty, draw on other instructional materials approved by the State Board of Education (SBE), as well as resources provided by other public institutions like local museums, archives, and libraries.
Academic Skill Development
Any meaningful education must equip students with the necessary tools to engage and invest in their own learning. Reading, writing, speaking, listening and collaboration are all critical to student success, and foundational to the principles of ethnic studies. During lesson planning,

Commented [91]: and healing informed Formatted: Strikethrough

44

ethnic studies educators should reflect upon different ways (exercises, homework assignments, service-learning projects, etc.) to get students to engage in ethnic studies content while rigorously developing academic and civic engagement skills. With fewer K�12 instructional materials available for implementing ethnic studies, as compared to traditional fields, it is integral that teachers collaborate with each other to develop new units, lessons, and other instructional materials. School administrators can support this collaboration by allotting time within professional development days or during department meetings.
Teacher development in these key areas can help ensure that students in ethnic studies courses will develop a firm grasp of the field, as well as critical social and academic literacies that equip them to meaningfully participate as confident and engaged citizens.
Stand-Alone Courses
This section includes an overview of sample courses that districts can use as guidance for creating their own ethnic studies courses with engaging lessons that connect with the demographics in their communities. Stand-alone courses provide students the opportunity to delve into content relevant to specific core fields, and allow teachers to develop robust and focused curriculum. Overall, this approach to ethnic studies provides some of the most concentrated and comprehensive spaces for learning about a particular area within an ethnic studies core field.
The sample course overviews below address the original ethnic studies disciplines. When stand-alone ethnic studies courses were initially developed at the college level, they represented four core people of color groups: Black/African American Studies, Chicano/a Studies, Native American Studies, and Asian American Studies. The use of these four groups as an umbrella for a myriad of ethnically and culturally diverse representations was replicated when courses in ethnic studies were developed at the high school level. It is important to note that there are groups that are sometimes addressed under the broadly defined umbrella of those core groups. For example, Arab Americans and Pacific Islanders have often been covered within the study of Asian American Studies. There is a range of sample UC, A�Gapproved course outlines in Appendix A which cover a variety of communities that represent the rich diversity of California. A list of suggested significant events and individuals that can be included, as well as, sample lessons that are aligned to the ethnic studies principles from
45

chapter 1 and the state-adopted content standards in history�social science, English language arts, and English language development, are available in Appendix B.
African American Studies
The study of people of African descent has taken on various academic field names, including: Afro-American Studies, African American Studies, Africana Diaspora Studies, Pan African Studies, Black Studies, and Africana Studies, to name a few. While they all cover the contributions, histories, cultures, politics, and socialization of people of African descent, naming often differs as a way denote an emphasis on particular political background or ideological approach; to express that this iteration of the field will be African-centered or focus on people of African descent in the Americas; and some names are no longer used simply due to the evolution of the field and shifting identity markers. For example, Afro-American Studies dates back to the late 1960s, and is mostly no longer used. The name was largely replaced with Black Studies in response to the Black Power movement. While the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does not endorse any particular field over another, Ethnic Studies educators and administrators are encouraged to consider student demographics, needs, interests, and current events when crafting a course or lesson, as this may help determine what iteration of the field will be most useful for the class. For example, if you are teaching a class with a large amount of first generation African students, perhaps an Africana or African Diaspora Studies approach would be most beneficial.
An African American Studies course can be designed to be an introduction to the study of people of African descent in the United States, while drawing connections to Africa and the African diaspora. Students explore the history, cultures, struggles, and politics of African Americans as part of the African diaspora across time. This course contends with how race, gender, and class shape life in the United States for people of African descent, while simultaneously introducing students to new frameworks like Afrofuturism. Ultimately, this course considers the development of Black identity in the United States and explores the importance African Americans played in the formation of the United States, the oppression they faced, the exploitation of black labor within capitalism, and the continued fight for liberation.
This course can explore the African American and African Diaspora experience, from the precolonial ancestral roots in Africa to the trans-Atlantic slave trade and enslaved people's uprisings in the antebellum South, to the elements of Hip Hop and African cultural retentions.

This class is designed to engage various themes, time periods, genres and cultures along the spectrum of Blackness.
Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies
The study of people of Latinx descent has taken on various academic field names, including: Raza Studies, Chicano Studies, Chicana/o Studies, Latina/o Studies, Central American Studies, Chican@/Latin@ Studies, Chicanx/Latinx Studies, and Xicanx/Latinx Studies, to name a few. While they all cover the contributions, histories, cultures, politics, and socialization of people from Mesoamerica, South America, the Caribbean, and the United States Southwest, naming often differs as a way to denote an emphasis on a particular experience, and language evolution. For example, Chicano derived fields focused on the experiences of Mexican Americans, and grew out of student activism that called for the creation of a field that addressed the history, contributions, injustices, and historical oppression of primarily Mexican Americans. Today, Chicano as an identity and the field of Chicano/a/x/ Studies has been broadened to include a range of Latinx backgrounds and experiences. Embracing the term Chicano is embracing the inherent activism and social justice leanings. As another example, the use of "@" was popularized during the early 2000s as a way to include both genders and as a nod to the burgeoning digital age. The recent use of "x" is done for two purposes. The first "x" in Xicanx replaces the "ch" because the sound produced by "x" is much more in line with the N�huatl language and indigenous etymologies. The second "x" renders the term gender-neutral and more inclusive of all identities.
A Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x course can explore the complexities of the indigenous, mestizo and Afro-mestizo populations from Latin America (the Americas and Caribbean) that have been grouped in the United States under the demographic label of Latino/a, and more recently, Latinx. Latinx populations come from different countries with varying languages and dialects, customs and cultural practices. The common experiences that unite these diverse populations are their indigenous and African roots/identities, the experience and ancestral memories of European colonization, cultural practices, U.S. imperialism, migration, resistance, and colonial languages (i.e., Spanish and Portuguese).
Furthermore, this course can offer an introductory study of Chicana/o/x in the contemporary United States, focusing primarily on history, roots, migration, education, politics, and art as they relate to the Chicana/o/x experience. More specifically, this course also introduces the concept
47

and terminology of Chicano/a, Xicanx, or Latinx as an evolving political and social identity. Lastly, students cover the birth of the 1960s Chicano Movement as well as more contemporary social movements that have sought to highlight the experiences of Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x people.
This course can delve into a wealth of topics that have defined the Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x experience ranging from indigeneity, the European invasion of the Americas, colonial independence movements, migration to the United States, identity formation, culture, social movements, and resistance to exploitative labor practices. Through interactive lectures, readings, class activities, writing prompts, collaborative group projects, presentations, and discussions, students in this course examine the following: The cultural formation and transformation of Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x communities, the role of women in shaping Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x culture, Chicana/o/x muralism, Mexican immigrants in American culture, and much more.
Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
The study of people of Asian descent has taken on various academic field names, including Asian American Studies and Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies. Additionally, various subfields have emerged out of Asian American Studies as a means of including groups that have been historically marginalized and understudied within the field. Arab American Studies, Southeast Asian Studies, Filipina/o/x Studies, and Pacific Islander Studies are just a few. While the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does not endorse any particular field or subfield over another, ethnic studies educators and administrators are encouraged to consider student demographics, needs, interests, and current events when crafting a course or lesson, as this may help determine what iteration of the field will be most useful for the class. For example, if you are teaching a class with a large amount of first-generation Hmong and Vietnamese students, perhaps a Southeast Asian Studies approach would be most beneficial.
An Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies course can be designed to be an introduction to the socio-political construction of Asian American and Pacific Islander identity in the United States. Students can explore the history, cultures, struggles, and politics of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as part of the larger Asian diaspora. This course contends with how race, gender, and class shape life in the United States for people of Asian descent, while simultaneously introducing students to concepts like Pan-Asianism and transnationalism.
48

Ultimately, this course considers the re/formation of Asian identity, culture, and politics within the United States.
This course can explore a broad range of topics and events pertaining to the Asian American and Pacific Islander experiences, and examine their contributions to the state and U.S. throughout history. Topics shouldmay include: immigration, intergenerational conflict, the myth and consequences of the model minority, the internment of Japanese Americans, the contributions of Chinese Americans to developing the U.S. railroad system, the contributions of Hmongs to American war efforts in Southeast Asia, Ozawa v. U.S. and U.S. v. Thind on rights to U.S. citizenship based on "whiteness", U.S. Supreme Court Case Lau v. Nichols regarding the right to an equal education, the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners, Filipina/o/x, South Asians, Southeast Asians, East Asians, Pacific Islanders, and U.S. colonialism and imperialism in the Pacific.
Native American and Indigenous Studies
The study of Native and indigenous people has taken on various academic field names, including, American Indian Studies, Native American Studies, and Indigenous Studies. While they all cover the histories, contributions, politics, and cultures of indigenous people, the specific academic field names are often used to denote specific groups. While American Indian and Native American Studies refer to the study of indigenous people in the Americas, Indigenous Studies takes a more global approach and is used to discuss indigenous and aboriginal people beyond the U.S. While Mexican Americans and Latina/o/x Americans have native ancestry, their indigenous histories are addressed in the Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x course outline.
This course can explore the complexity and diversity of Native American experiences from the pre-contact era to the present, highlighting key concepts like indigeneity, settler colonialism, environmental justice, cultural retention, cultural hegemony, imperialism, genocide, language groups, self-determination, land acknowledgement, and tribal sovereignty. The course can provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how the role of imperialism, settler colonialism, and genocide, both cultural and physical, of North American Native Americans contributed to the formation of the United States. Students are exposed to the history and major political, social, and cultural achievements of various Native American tribes. Overall, students have an opportunity to critically engage readings, materials, and sources from indigenous perspectives.

The course can have key goals such as: (1) Foreground the rich history of sovereign and autonomous Native American tribes. (2) Delve into the implications of genocide and forced land removal on Native American populations. (3) Grapple with the cultural and ideological similarities and differences amongst various tribes in and outside of the California region. Students identify salient values, traditions, and customs relevant to California-based Native American populations. And (4), highlight major periods of resistance and social activism, like the American Indian Movement (AIM), and recent movements around the Emeryville Shellmounds and the Dakota Access Pipeline.
Integrating Ethnic Studies into Existing Courses
While an increasing number of districts across the state have worked to develop and implement ethnic studies courses, there are still many districts that have not offered the course for a multitude of reasons (e.g., budgetary and other infrastructural constraints, lack of instructional resources and curriculum support, etc.) Consequently, many educators have worked diligently to include ethnic studies concepts, terms, and topics into existing courses. It is not uncommon to see ethnic studies integrated into history�social science courses, including U.S. history, world history, economics, psychology, social studies, and geography. There are also cases of ethnic studies being included in visual and performing arts, mathematics, science, English language arts, and other subject areas.
For example, a geography teacher might develop a unit or lesson around urban geography, where students can delve into key concepts like environmental racism and ecological justice, and focus on the experiences of people of color in those spaces. Students could draw on local news stories, primary sources like housing and city planning maps, archived oral history interviews from current and past residents of the area, and literary texts that speak to the experiences of people of color in urban spaces like Sandra Cisneros' House on Mango Street, Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun, and the poetry of Janice Mirikitani.
This approach ensures that the intersectional lens that ethnic studies provides is salient and manifests within various subject areas. Moreover, this approach further enriches traditional subject areas by including a range of perspectives that can further elucidate the overall course content.
50

The Cultural Proficienty Continuum for History-Social Science, based on the work of Geneva Gay, Randall Lindsey, Stephanie Graham and others, provides an example of how ethnic studies can be integrated into history-social science courses. It asks important questions about the content and curriculum materials we use in classrooms. The selection of curriculum content and resources may be intentional or unintentional but are worthy of analysis if we are intent on providing a culturally proficient curriculum for students. In the teaching of history, as described in the History-Social Science Framework for California Public Schools, as a story well told, we need to ask ourselves, whosewho's story are we telling? Which perspectives are shared? What message or agenda is delivered? The Continuum can be found at https://www.lacoe.edu/Portals/0/CurriculumInstruction/HSS/HSS%20Cultural%20Proficiency%20Continuum%20FINAL.pdf?ver=2020-0908-142513-047
Grade Level
Ethnic studies has primarily been taught at the college/university and high school (ninth through twelfth grade) levels. However, some districts have offered the course for grades six through eight, and at the K�5 level ethnic studies may be included as a stand-alone unit. Understanding how race and ethnicity impacts society should be an essential core component of every students' K�12 education experience. The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum has been developed for educators teaching grades nine through twelve, and in alignment with the University of California and California State University System "A�G" subject requirements. Adjusting assignments, modes of assessment and readings, as well as pedagogical approach, are most important to consider when modifying the model curriculum to be developmentally appropriate and fit a specific grade level.
From a history�social science perspective, students may study the history and culture of a single, historically racialized group in the United States. Examples may include a course on African American, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Native American, or Chicana/o and Latina/o history and how these identities may relate to the mainstream/dominant American culture.
The course could also focus on an in-depth comparative study of the history, politics, culture, contributions, challenges, and current status of two or more racial or ethnic groups in the United States. This course could, for example, concentrate on how these groups experienced the
51

process of racial and ethnic formation in a variety of contexts and how these categories changed over time. The relationship between global events and an ethnic or racial group's experience could be another area of study. In this vein, students could study how Asian Americans like Ozawa and Thind fought in courts for the right to be considered "white" to attain U.S. citizenship, how World War II drew African Americans from the South to California cities like Oakland and Los Angeles, how the Iranian Revolution and its aftermath affected Iranian immigrants in the United States, or how Armenian Americans mobilized to urge the U.S. government to formally acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. Many peoples came to the United States fleeing oppression, war, or genocide, including those listed above and others such as Assyrians and Jews. Alternatively, a course could honefocus in on the local community and examine the interactions and coalition-building among a number of ethnic and/or racial groups. In an ethnic studies course, students will become aware of the constant themes of social justice and responsibility, while recognizing these are defined differently over time.
As identity and the use of power are central to ethnic studies courses, instructors should demonstrate a willingness to reflect critically on their own perspective and personal histories as well as engage students as co-investigators in the inquiry process. A wide range of sources (e.g., literature, court cases, government files, memoirs, art, music, oral histories) and remnants of popular culture can be utilized to better understand the experiences of historically disenfranchised groups--such as Native Americans, African Americans, Chicana/o and Latina/o, and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. At the same time, students should be aware of how the different media have changed over time and how that has shaped the depiction of the different groups.
Models of instruction should be student-centered. For example, students could develop research questions based on their lived experiences in order to critically study their communities. Reading and studying multiple perspectives, participating in community partnerships, collecting oral histories, completing service-learning projects, or engaging in Youth Participatory Action Research can all serve as effective instructional approaches for this course.
Teachers can organize their instruction around a variety of themes, such as the movement to create ethnic studies courses in high schools and universities; personal explorations of students' racial, ethnic, cultural, and national identities; the history of racial construction, both domestically and internationally; and the influence of the media on the framing and formation of identity and determine outlets and opportunities for students to exercise their civic rights and responsibilities
52

and practice advocating for social and policy changes. Students can investigate the history of the experience of various ethnic groups in the United States, as well as the diversity of these experiences based on race, gender, and sexuality, among other identities.
To study these themes, students can consider a variety of investigative questions, including large, overarching questions about the definitions of ethnic studies as a field of inquiry, economic and social class in American society, social justice, social responsibility, civic rights and responsibilities, and social change. They can ask how race has been constructed in the United States and other parts of the world. They can investigate the relationship between race, gender, sexuality, social class, and economic and political power. They can explore the nature of citizenship by asking how various groups have become American and examining cross-racial and inter-ethnic interactions among immigrants, migrants, people of color, and working people. They can investigate the legacies of social movements and historic struggles against injustice in California, the Southwest, and the United States as a whole and study how different social movements for people of color, women, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities have mutually informed each other.
Students can also personalize their study by considering how their personal and/or family stories connect to the larger historical narratives and how and why some narratives have been privileged over others. Lastly, students may consider how to improve their own community, what constructive actions can be taken, and how whether they can provide a model for change for those in other parts of the state, country, and world.
Thematic/Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies Approach
Increasingly, ethnic studies courses have been developed and taught using a thematic and comparative race approach. Teachers will often identify key themes and concepts within the field that can be used to investigate the histories, contributions, and struggles of multiple groups, both individually and collectively. Identity, colonialism, systems of power, and social justice are just a few of the many concepts and themes that can be engaged within an ethnic studies course employing this approach. In doing so, teachers are able to provide a space for multiple perspectives and narratives to be included in units and lessons simultaneously. This approach also encourages students to make links across racial and ethnic lines, and foregrounds the development of allies  who will act on the behalf of the harmed group in order to make change  and solidarity-building. Additionally, students are able to engage readings and
53

materials from multiple fields, thus, exposing them to new ideas and perspectives that they may not have encountered in a stand-alone ethnic studies course. As noted previously, teachers and administrators should consider their local student and community demographics when building the content of their courses while also weaving core understandings on the origins and evolution of race as an American concept is adequately covered.
Another way to engage this approach is by using themes to delve into several core ethnic studies areas independently. For example, during a 16-week semester, educators can divide the course up evenly, with approximately four weeks dedicated to the study of different core fields, and a salient focus on particular themes across all the core fields. Overall, the thematic and comparative approaches often stress the importance of identifying shared struggles, building unity, and developing intercultural communication and competence, and empowering youth to leverage their rights and responsibilities as civic participants in a democratic republic to promote positive change.
Introduction to Ethnic Studies
This section contains a sample course outline for a general Introduction to Ethnic Studies course utilizing a thematic approach. Districts can use this outline as guidance for creating their own ethnic studies courses that reflect the student demographics in their communities.
The thematic course draws from the four core disciplines that were the original basis of ethnic studies, and provides opportunities for educators to utilize the themes to make connections to their classroom demographics. These disciplines have continued to evolve and change over time. African American Studies has had various academic names, but focuses on the experiences of people of African descent in the United States, while drawing connections to Africa and the African diaspora. Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies covers the contributions, histories, cultures, politics, and socialization of people from Mesoamerica, South America, the Caribbean, and the United States Southwest. Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies has grown to incorporate various subfields as a means of including groups that have been historically marginalized and under studied within the field, such as Arab American Studies and will be further developed to cover more of the histories, contributions, politics, and cultures of Asian Americans in the United States. Finally, Native American Studies covers some of the histories, contributions, politics, and cultures of indigenous people in the Americas and will be
54

augmented to more adequately cover their contributions and sacrifices. While the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does not endorse any particular field or subfield over another, ethnic studies educators and administrators are encouraged to consider student demographics, needs, interests, and current events when crafting a course or lesson while also highlight critical stories and contributions that all students, no matter what race, should learn about to understand the development and evolution of race as a concept in the US, as this may help determine what iteration of the field will be most useful for the class. For example, if you are teaching a class with a large amount of first generation Hmong and Vietnamese students, perhaps an approach with emphasis on Southeast Asian contributions Studies approach would be most engagingbeneficial.
Introduction to Ethnic Studies Course Outline
Course Overview: This course is designed to help students develop an intersectional and global understanding of the impact of race and racism, ethnicity, and culture in the shaping of individuals and communities in the United States. They will learn about the interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that impact all people of color. Students will be exposed to a multitude of histories, perspectives, traditions, and cultures, with the goal of students being able to build critical analytical and intercultural communication skills; developing an understanding of geo-historical and cultural knowledge and contributions; fostering of humanism and collaboration across lines of difference; learning the value and strength in diversity; and developing a rigorous historical understanding of the development of racial and ethnic identities in the United States; and engaging in civic action, community service and/or community education to bring positive change that helps build a future society free of racism and other forms of bigotry associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and institutional racism[12].
Course Content: Given the interdisciplinary nature of ethnic studies, students will be exposed to many subject areas, including, but not limited to, history, geography, literature, sociology, anthropology, and visual arts.
The use of a thematic approach to teaching ethnic studies is incredibly generative and empowering as students are able to consider an array of inquiry-based questions--from more overarching questions around racial formation and their own ancestral legacies, to more focused inquiries that may address issues in their communities, like a public health inequity that
55

is being exacerbated because of the racial and/or class make-up -- and draw conclusions to inform their action to promote change. Themes also allow students to delve into various perspectives simultaneously, where they are able to draw connections across racial and ethnic groups.
Throughout the course, each unit and lesson plan should be founded on the key values and principles of ethnic studies as described in Chapter 1. Further, they should support and develop the key outcomes of:
1. Pursuit of justice and equity
2. Working toward greater inclusivity
3. Furthering self-understanding
4. Developing a better understanding of others
5. Recognizing intersectionality
6. Promoting self-empowerment for civic engagement
7. Supporting a community focus
8. Developing interpersonal communication
Some ethnic studies teachers begin lessons by acknowledging that they are on native land, and honor the specific indigenous peoples who have had a close relationship to that land in the past and present. Each sample theme below includes sample lessons located in Appendix B. They are designed to show how a teacher might cover a particular portion of a theme. Please note that these lessons are meant to serve as exemplars for how teachers can organize a course around these central themes. They are not exhaustive, nor do they constitute a scope and sequence or full curriculum. Teachers and administrators are encouraged to address themes and specific content that are reflective of the demographics of their communities. Many of the sample lessons provided in Appendix B can be adapted to tell the stories of other groups. Further, many of the lessons could be used to support an alternate theme. For example, the

Redlining Lesson located in the Systems of Power theme, also fits within the theme of History and Movement.

Sample Theme #1: Identity

1. What factors shape our identities? What parts of our identities do we choose for

ourselves? What parts are determined for us by others, by society, or by chance?

2. What dilemmas arise when others view us differently than we view ourselves?

3. How do our identities influence our choices and the choices available to us?

4. What factors influence our identity, and in turn, the choices we make?

5. How is identity shaped and reshaped by my circumstances, history, ancestry/heritage, or

institutions?

6. How can we differentiate between our identities as individuals versus our group identities

(as part of a race/ethnic, gender, etc.?

5.7.

How can we become aware of and counteract our own biases based on group

identities and those of others and recognize and act on our agency to model and

promote more positive moral/ethical behaviors?

"Adolescence is, by definition, a time of transition, when young people begin to take their places as responsible and participating members of their communities. As young people weigh their future choices, they wrestle with issues of loyalty and belief. The adolescent's central developmental questions are `Who am I?' `Do I matter?' and `How can I make a difference?' They seek people and paths that are worthy of their loyalty and commitment, challenge hypocrisy, and bring passion and new perspectives to enterprises that capture their imaginations and engage their involvement."[13]
Adolescence brings with it new abilities to think abstractly and meta-cognitively, so this exploration of identity is developmentally responsive. The high-engagement reflection on ourselves, who we are, how we are perceived by others, and how our identity influences our perspective, choices, and impact, builds schema for a more sophisticated understanding of agency and for deep ethical reflection. It also provides an initial basis for delving into the tension between the universal and particular--understanding and drawing out universal lessons on human behavior while respecting the integrity of particular moments and experiences.

57

Our society--through its particular culture, customs, institutions, and more--provides us with the labels we use to categorize the people we encounter. These labels are based on beliefs about race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, economic class, and more. Sometimes our beliefs about these categories are so strong that they prevent us from seeing the unique identities of others. Sometimes these beliefs also make us feel suspicion, fear, or hatred toward some members of our society. Other times, especially when we are able to get to know a person, we are able to see past labels and, perhaps, find common ground and value and appreciate differences. Some examples of topics that could be used to explore questions of identity are the "model minority myth" and its historic and contemporary implications for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, the experiences of Arab Americans and the rise of Islamophobia and discrimination against Sikhs in the aftermath of 9/11 and the War on Terror, the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence, and the way that Native Americans have challenged the use of native iconography and dress for mascots on college campuses and professional sports leagues.

Sample Theme #2: History and Movement

1. What does it mean to live on this land? Who may become an American? What happens

when multiple narratives are layered on top of each other? Who gets to shape the

American narrative? Whose narratives are heard, valued, and captured? How can the

American narrative be more inclusive of all its people?

2. How has American should societyies integrate newcomers? How do newcomers develop

a sense of belonging to the places where they have arrived? How does power dynamics

affect the integration and belonging process?

3. How does migration affect the identities of individuals, communities and nations?

4. How do ideas or narratives about who may belong in a nation affect immigration policy,

the lives of immigrants, and host communities?

5. What role have immigrants played in defining notions of democracy?

5.6.

What needs to change in immigration policy and how can we foster such

change?

Commented [98]: Should be a separate question

Another theme that this course could focus on is an in-depth study of the migration of people of color to California. Within this theme of history and movement, teachers will develop and facilitate instructional opportunities for students to explore intense migration periods like:

58

� The Second Great Migration (1940-1970) � The mass exodus of African Americans from the rural South to urban cities across the Northeast, Midwest, and West. Students could focus on the World War II era, in particular port cities like Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, and Richmond, whose African American populations skyrocketed with the increase of job opportunities to support the maritime, munitions, and other military industries. Teachers can discuss how this period of migration reshaped urban cities in California; grapple with how the influx of African American migrants impacted racial politics and dynamics in the state; and highlight the major contributions African Americans made to the political, socioeconomic, and cultural life of the state.
� Southeast Asian Refugee Crisis � Students can discuss the implications of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese, Cambodian, Hmong, and Laotian populations into the 1970s and 1980s. Beyond learning about the war, the fall of Saigon, the era of the Khmer Rouge, and other significant events of this period, students can also delve into the experiences of Southeast Asian immigrants, the racial enclaves they created in California (Sacramento, Long Beach, and Fresno are just a few cities with vibrant Southeast Asian refugee communities), their contributions, and ongoing struggles.
� Native American Removal � Students will be able to discuss early settlers and the U.S. government's often fraught engagement with Native American tribes dating back to the eighteenth century. Sample topics and events include: the Indian Removal Act of 1830, forced migration, the creation of Reservations, broken treaties, and the enacting of genocide against Native American people. Overall, these topics will provide students with a better understanding of the struggles many Native American tribes endured, while also connecting those struggles to western expansion, manifest destiny, and the establishment of the contiguous U.S.
� Migrants and Refugees from Latin America � Students can discuss the growing number of refugees from Central America, beginning with refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua in the late 1970s. Beyond learning about U.S. intervention in the region, students can explore the experience of recent refugees in California. For example, the mass exodus of Salvadorans fleeing the war-torn country during the 1980s, later settling in California in large numbers. These latest refugees can be considered with the indigenous Latinx community in the United States, which has faced historic loss of lands and rights. Related topics include the 1910 Great Mexican Migration,
59

the Great Depression, Mexican repatriation, the Bracero Program, and Operation Wetback. Additionally, students should delve into the migration of Central American, Latin American, and Caribbean populations. This history can help students better contextualize current controversial discussions on immigration. Further, students can learn how California and the Southwest were part of Mexico from 1810�1848 (see map of Disturnell).
� Populations Displaced by War and Genocide � Students can conduct studies of how other populations affected by war or genocide have migrated to the United States. Historical examples include the population of Armenian Americans that settled in California in the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide. Another example is the effect that World War II and the Holocaust had upon the American Jewish population. A more contemporary study could be based on the migration of Syrian, Afghani, and other refugees from the Middle East to the United States as a result of the recent wars in that region. Topics can include the experiences of the members of these groups and the political shifts and reactions that each event prompted within the United States. The CDE's Model Curriculum for Human Rights and Genocide is a useful resource on these topics (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/hs/im/documents/modelcurrichrgenoc.pdf).
In addition to learning more about the history of migration from these various perspectives, teachers can help facilitate discussions on xenophobia and anti-immigrant sentiment, while emphasizing the nation's history of being a home for immigrants, the merit-based promises offered by a capitalist economy, and the value of having a diverse citizenry, while challenging students to interrogate the conclusions drawn with evidence.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework
Chapter 14 of the framework includes an outline of an elective ethnic studies course. This course outline includes a classroom example (page 313) where students engage in an oral history project about their community. This example includes discussion of redlining and other policies that resulted in "white flight" and the concentration of communities of color into certain neighborhoods.
Teachers can expand upon the classroom example, and connect it to the themes described in this model curriculum.
Sample Theme #3: Systems of Power
60

1. What is the relationship between the individual and American society?

2. How and why does American society divide people into groups?

3. How do social systems/perceptions, institutional policies and practices, and cultural

backgrounds influence the choices we make?

4. Is there a social hierarchy in the United States? If so, what is it? And, Wwhat are the

implications for a society when it categorizes people into a social hierarchy? What are

the roles of institutions in promoting or enforcing these social hierarchies?

5. How can we facilitate equality and justice for all in a democratic society? What can an

individual do differently today to ensure that all voices are represented, valued and

heard?

4.6.

How might an individual contribute to our support power inequities

unintentionally? How does this apply to your daily life? What biases are you aware of

(within yourself and observed in others)? How can you facilitate or promote change?

Another theme that can be covered in this type of ethnic studies course is systems of power. Teachers can introduce the theme by defining and providing examples of systems of power, which can include economic systems like capitalism and social systems like patriarchy. These are structures that have the capacity to control circumstances within economic, political, and/or social-cultural contexts. These systems are often controlled by those in power and go on to determine how society is organized and functions.
In introducing this theme, teachers should consider taking one system of power, like sexism and patriarchy, and offering perspectives across the various ethnic groups. Discussions of systems of power should include both the struggles that come with being entangled and impacted by these systems, but also resistance to them. Systems of power can be analyzed using the four "I"s of oppression (ideology, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized).
Building on the theme of sexism and patriarchy, teachers can concentrate on the various ways in which women and femmes of color have been oppressed and resisted. Alternatively, this section can include a discussion on how women of color resisted and elevated women's rights issues (e.g., adequate reproductive health care and equal pay) via social movements (e.g., the second wave feminist and #Metoo movements), the creation of their own organizations, through writings (literature, poems, and scholarly works), and other mediums. In addressing this theme,

61

teachers may plan a lesson that addresses U.S. housing inequality, including issues of redlining and racial housing covenants.

Making Connections to the English Language Arts/English Language Development Framework:

Chapter 7 of the framework includes a snapshot activity entitled, "Investigating Language, Culture, and Society: Linguistic Autobiographies" (page 726). This lesson example has students reflect on their own histories of using language in different contexts, and reflects a number of the ethnic studies themes described in this model curriculum. This could be a useful lesson to explore the ways that language is utilized as a system of power.

Sample Theme #4: Social Movements and Equity 1. What debates and dilemmas from past historical moments remain unresolved?Why?

1.2.

What makes a social movement successful or effective? What are the risks?

What are the root causes for the success and failures of different social movements?

3. What does equity entail? What is the difference between equality and equity? Why does

this matter?

2.4.

How can one make a difference in the community? In society?

5. What are the formal and informal ways of promoting change in our democratic society?

How are social movements effective? What are their limitations?

3.6.

What other methods are there to foster equity? What knowledge, skills, and tools

are needed to create change in our communities and in our larger society?

Another theme that this course could explore is the multitude of effective social movements communities have initiated and sustained in response to oppression and systems of power. Teachers will develop and facilitate instructional opportunities for students to explore major social movements like:
� The Civil Rights Movement
� The Farm Workers Movement
� Japanese American Redress and Reparations
� Black Lives Matter

62

� Mni Wiconi[14] Water is Life: No Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock
In addition to learning more about the history of social movements and the gains achieved through solidarity, activism, civil disobedience, and participation in the democratic process, teachers can help facilitate discussions on resistance to oppression, the broad support these movements mobilized, and their lasting impacts of the change. The teacher can also introduce situations where young people engaged in protest against injustice, such as the lunch counter sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement, or the 1968 East Los Angeles student walkouts to advocate for improved educational opportunities and protest racial discrimination.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework discusses a number of civil rights movements that were created in response to political, economic, and social discrimination. Teachers can build upon the example of the struggle to preserve the San Francisco Bay Area shellmound sites of the Ohlone people and have students compare that to some of the other movements referenced in the framework, such as the 1969�1971 occupation of Alcatraz or the American Indian Movement's 1972�73 standoff at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This lesson can also be connected to the Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement lesson in Appendix B.
Sample Lesson and Unit Plan Templates
Two sample templates for developing an ethnic studies curriculum are provided below. The first contains both general concepts that are common to other content areas and some specific areas that are specific to ethnic studies. A discussion of the specific components of this template follows.
The second is a unit plan template that allows teachers to curate a more dynamic, responsive, and relevant learning experience. This tool is meant to serve as the bridge between a larger course overview, which maps out the overall year's (or semester) scope and sequence, and the day-to-day lesson plans, which provide detailed teacher moves and preparation specific to a lesson.
Other frameworks for developing ethnic studies lessons exist online. For example, Christine Sleeter has produced a Teaching Works article that describes a curriculum planning framework
63

focused on ethnic studies content that is culturally responsive to the lived experience of students.[15]
Table: Sample Lesson Template
Lesson Title and Grade Level(s): Add title of the lesson and grade level.
Standards Alignment: Lessons should be aligned to the academic content standards adopted by the SBE. In the History�Social Science Content Standards for California Public Schools, grade nine is reserved as an elective year. Therefore, most ethnic studies courses that are offered as electives will not align to specific grade-level history�social science content standards. However, teachers may want to show alignment to standards in the grade eleven United States History and Geography course or the grade twelve Principles of American Democracy course, as a way of demonstrating how ethnic studies content connect to other history�social science disciplines. However, the history�social science standards also include a set of Historical and Social Sciences Analysis skills for grades nine through twelve. These skills, organized under the headers of Chronological and Spatial Thinking, Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View, and Historical Interpretation, do connect directly with the objectives of a rigorous ethnic studies course.
Other standards that should be addressed are the California Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy in History/Social Studies, Science, and Technical Subjects (CCSS for ELA/Literacy) and the California English Language Development Standards (CA ELD Standards). The CCSS for ELA/Literacy include grade-level expectations for student skill development in reading, writing, speaking and listening, and language, with an expectation on the skills needed to prepare students for college and careers. In particular, the writing and reading expectations for students in ethnic studies courses should align strongly with the expectations in the CCSS for ELA/Literacy. The CA ELD Standards provide progressions across the grade levels for students at the emerging, expanding, and bridging levels of English language acquisition.
Lesson Purpose and Overview: Each lesson should have a brief narrative overview of the lesson and its purpose. This narrative should describe how the lesson is connected to the broader unit, describe the specific concept(s) and/or topic(s) that students will engage, and begin to highlight some of the texts (i.e. primary and scholarly sources) that students will
64

delve into. The purpose of this section is to provide a clear description on how the lesson topic connects to skill development, and to provide a glimpse into the overall lesson.
Key Terms and Concepts: The lesson outline should also have a list of the critical academic vocabulary specific to ethnic studies that students will learn over the course of instruction. These terms and concepts should connect directly to the lesson topic.
Lesson Objectives: The lesson objectives identify what the desired takeaways are from the lesson. In other words, when the lesson is concluded, a student should have gained an understanding of the lesson content and be able to apply demonstrate that knowledge using specific skills. It is essential that lesson objectives to be written with active verbs based on cognitive demand (example: students will be able to infer the imperialist motives of Columbus using his journals).
Essential Questions: The use of essential or guiding questions is an approach that was used within the History�Social Science Framework to support student inquiry. Framing instruction around questions of significance allows students to have choice and agency to develop and engage with their content knowledge in greater depth. This approach transforms students into active learners, as they are able to conduct research and evaluate sources in an effort to develop a claim about the question.
Lesson Steps/Activities: The steps in the lesson should be clear and discrete. In addition to more conventional lesson activities, teachers should consider including a cultural energizer and/or community building activity at the start of each lesson. They can include traditional icebreakers that involve movement, music, and games, and community-unity chants. The class can also begin with silent reflection on a question related to the lesson, followed by small group sharing, and culminating with a larger class wide discussion. Energizers or community builders should typically take no more than 10-15 minutes, depending on the activity. If done well, the energizer/community builder will pique student interest in the lesson, generate energy and enthusiasm for learning, and facilitate connection between students, the teacher, and the larger community.
Another activity to consider at the end of the lesson is a community reflection. This activity concludes the lesson with a meaningful reflection of student experience as it pertains to the objectives of the day. Teachers can facilitate this portion in various ways. For example, teachers can ask students to complete a silent, pen-to-paper response to a prompt.
65

Commented [99]: Should giving students opportunities for students to practice persuasive speaking or writing on an issue or topic be part of the lesson objectives?

Teachers should create prompts that encourage students to reflect upon learnings and challenges, outstanding questions, connections to prior learning, and so on. The key to this portion of the lesson is that it be used to meaningfully review key takeaways, clarify mis/understandings, answer questions, generate questions, and connect to the larger purpose of the course.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: Instruction cannot be effective if the teacher is unable to determine if the students have mastered the content. Furthermore, students should be able to apply transfer skills and knowledge learned to solve problems. Therefore it is important to include both formative and summative assessment within the lesson plan. Formative assessment takes place during instruction and allows the teacher to modify that instruction to assist learning. Summative assessments measure student achievement or progress toward mastery of the content, may take place at the end of a lesson, unit, or term, and may take the form of a performative task.
Materials and Resources: The selection of materials and resources can be difficult. At the very least, there needs to be sufficient resources for students to conduct the lesson activities, address the essential questions, and achieve the lesson objectives. However, it should be noted that students can be self-directed to share their lived experiences and conduct research to identify more resources for inclusion and further investigation. There is certainly a range of primary and secondary sources that can accomplish these goals. But teachers need to be aware of some concerns when selecting resources. Online resources are plentiful, but have to be approached with caution. Links often expire, and while the content is usually available somewhere else, it can at times be difficult to find the new location. A web page that hosts a resource may also have content or links that can take students to sites that are inappropriate or offensive. Students and teachers should seize the opportunity to collaboratively learn by together interrogating new resources for their merits and evidence of truth.
That particular issue is less present in print materials, but those materials also need to be reviewed carefully. The Education Code has requirements for social content that prohibit districts from adopting instructional materials that include advertising or contain content that demeans, stereotypes, or patronizes various specified groups.[16] There are also potential copyright issues when using sources that are not within the public domain. For these reasons, LEAs may wish to focus on resources that are not commercial in nature, or

Commented [100]: Should this do more to articulate elements of students doing the investigation, civil dialogue, and informed action?

66

websites that are from *.gov, *.edu, or, in some cases, *.org domains. When commercial products, such as a textbook or DVD, are used, LEAs should make sure that those materials are properly vetted through the local selection process for instructional materials (see below).

Table: Sample Unit Plan Template
Summative Assessments/Performance Tasks:
Identify when the summative assessment(s) will be given and indicate where it will be administered in the appropriate week. What will students be able to do at the end of the unit? Plan backwards from your summative assessment(s), keeping in mind what students will need to be successful.
Unit Overview: A general summary of what students will study, and why, during the unit, including concepts, content, and skills. Places the unit within the context of a yearly (or semester long) course of study.
Unit Enduring Understandings: An Enduring Understanding is a statement that summarizes important ideas and core processes that are central to a discipline, promotes student engagement, and hashave real-world applications lasting value beyond the classroom.
Essential Questions: An Essential Question is an overarching question that provides focus and engages students. Framing instruction around questions of significance allows students to develop their content knowledge in greater depth.
Unit Planning/Description of Week: Provide a brief overview of what students will be engaging for the week.
Standards Alignment: Units should be aligned to the academic content standards adopted by the SBE.
Learning Experiences and Instructional Sequence: Identify and sequence the daily and/or weekly instructional experiences and best practices that will allow students to meet the student learning outcomes independently. Allows instructor to consider and plan an

Commented [101]: Comment on student practice of effecting change too?

engaging learning experience for students, including appropriate activities, differentiation and best practices, for all students.
Student Learning Outcomes and Formative Assessments: Describes how students will demonstrate what they know and are able to do related to the unit outcomes. Formative assessments are ongoing and allow teachers to monitor learning and build student capacity towards the unit's summative assessment.
Engagement and Activity Tracker: This tool allows teachers to keep the diverse learning community in mind while planning. In ethnic studies, it is paramount that energizers, engaging multimodal activities, and a multiplicity of student tasks are utilized throughout the learning experience. Teachers can use this section to rate both their lessons and instructional sequence for the unit and ensure that moments tending toward the static and less active, are followed by periods of dynamic activity, and that moments of intensive, individual, silent and sustained reading or writing are followed by collective discussion and multimodal exercise. However, the measure of student engagement should not be limited to the activities in a classroom. Ethnic studies should mobilize students to do something beyond the classroom, to engage with their community and/or take on informed action to address a larger community or societal issue.
Summative Assessments/Performance Tasks: These should be administered at the end of each unit. They should assess understanding, knowledge, and skills, and student disposition to take informed positive action. Summative assessments can be in the form of a culminating writing assignment, a class publication, the delivery of an oral presentation, etc. of the actions the student took to apply the knowledge and skills learned. They should also address the essential questions . And finally, they should have provided students the opportunity to demonstrate agency in a real-world context.

Commented [102]: Here is where the document is unclear. Engagement is discussed only in terms of the classroom. Engagement should also be discussed in terms of civic engagement.
Commented [103]: This is another missed opportunity in stressing that civic engagement could be seen as a summative assessment/performance task.

Appendix A: UC-Approved Course Outlines
Content Note: these course outlines are presented as they were received from the University of California Office of the President or directly from the submitting district, to meet the requirement of Education Code Section 51226.7. They were not edited save for formatting, the removal of duplicative text, and correction of minor typographic errors. The hyperlinks in these documents have not been verified and their content has not been reviewed. For more information, contact the Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division of the California Department of Education at 916-319-0881.
UC-Approved Course Outlines Overview
The statute that authorized the development of this model curriculum, Education Code Section 51226.7, requires the inclusion of "examples of courses offered by local educational agencies that have been approved as meeting the A�G admissions requirements of the University of California and the California State University, including, to the extent possible, course outlines for those courses." This section addresses these course outlines, including guidance for local education agencies in their use.
The course outlines have been gathered into an appendix. They were all submitted for A�G approval by local educational agencies (LEAs) that administer high schools in California. They include general survey/introductory courses, African American studies courses, Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x studies courses, Native American and indigenous studies courses, Asian American/Pacific Islander studies courses, and comparative ethnic studies courses that combine any or all of the above. They are for a range of grade levels within the span of ninth through twelfth grade. The courses included are suitable examples for both semester and yearlong elective course offerings in history�social science and literature/language arts, but there are also outlines that are alternative versions of core courses (like the eleventh grade United States history and geography course) with an ethnic studies focus.
The A�G Requirements are a sequence of high school courses that students must complete to be eligible for admission to the University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU). The current A�G requirement includes 15 courses in a range of subject areas, all of which must be completed with a grade of C or higher. These courses represent the basic level of academic preparation that high school students should achieve to be ready to undertake university-level work.
77

Each year, the University of California Office of the President (UCOP) solicits lists of courses from LEAs to identify courses that can be used to meet the UC and CSU admission requirements. Users can submit their courses for A�G approval through an online portal (https://hs-articulation.ucop.edu/guide/). UC admissions staff and subject matter experts review submissions and approve the courses based on criteria that include rigor, required prerequisites, the level of student work required, course assignments and assessments, and the instructional materials used. Courses may be rejected if they lack sufficient content aligned to those criteria. Once a course is approved, it is added to an LEA's course list and is available for schools throughout the state to use.
Working in collaboration with the UCOP, the California Department of Education (CDE) gathered examples of course outlines that fit within the discipline of ethnic studies. The course outlines gathered in Appendix A are not an exhaustive list of every possible course that can be considered to be an "ethnic studies" course. They include a representative sample of available courses, a snapshot that was taken at a particular moment in time during the development of this model curriculum. LEAs are constantly developing new courses, and users of this model curriculum are encouraged to visit the UC A�G Course Management Portal at the link above to access the searchable database containing the latest course listings currently being offered by California high schools.
How to Use the Outlines
The course outlines provided with this model curriculum are intended to offer guidance to teachers and administrators interested in developing courses/units in ethnic studies. Every course is unique, and LEAs are encouraged to tailor their particular courses to the needs and interests of their student population. While the course outlines offer a wide range of potential courses, they are not intended to limit an LEA's options. The authorizing statute encourages LEAs to submit their own ethnic studies course outlines for approval as A�G courses, following their district course approval process.
The course outlines include a wide range of suggested courses. Some include considerable detail, including unit narratives, suggested resources, and descriptions of classroom activities and student assignments. Others have little more than a brief course overview. The format has been modified slightly in order to address CDE posting and accessibility requirements, but the content of the course outlines themselves has not been edited. These outlines are based on actual courses that LEAs have been offering in California schools. However, the inclusion of specific resources and/or activities within these course descriptions does not imply an endorsement of these items by the SBE or the CDE. The development of the model curriculum did not include a state-level review of the resources included in the UC A�G course outlines. LEAs should evaluate any resources suggested in the course outlines to ensure that the materials that they are using best address their local needs.
78

It is important to note that none of the course outlines included in Appendix A represent a complete curriculum. LEAs will still need to develop lessons, train teachers, and select instructional materials that will enable them to implement courses based upon these outlines.

Course Content
Unit 1: Self Identity and Defining Ethnic Studies
Introduction to how we can think about race and ethnicity in America. We will discuss the history of the formation of Ethnic Studies, power and privilege, and what it means to be American in our society. We also define the differences between race and ethnicity, along with other core ideas such as: assimilation, appropriation, alienation, oppression, stereotypes, and intersectionality. We will also discuss different forms of racism focusing on institutionalized and internalized racism. Students will be asked to reflect on their personal identity and how it fits in with the American image. In this written reflection students will be asked to reflect on their past experiences with racism and racial diversity. Students will also be asked to recognize their own privileges and how they have benefited from them.

Overview
87

Ethnic Studies courses operate from the consideration that race and racism have been, and continue to be, profoundly powerful social and cultural forces in American society. These courses focus on the experiences of African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os and Latinas/os, American Indians, and other racialized peoples in the United States. Courses are grounded in the concrete situations of people of color, and use a methodological framing that emphasizes both the structural dimensions of race and racism and the associated cultural dimensions. (Adapted from UC Berkeley, Department of Ethnic Studies). The major purpose of this course is to educate students to be politically, socially, and economically conscious about their personal connections to history. Ethnic Studies focuses on themes of social justice, social responsibility, and social change. The course spans from past to present, including politics and social reform, allowing students to identify social patterns and universal qualities present in all ethnic/cultural aspects of society, including their own.
This one semester course will focus on the experiences of African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, American Indians and Muslim and Arab Americans. This course will also include an identity unit in which students will consider concepts related to their own personal, group and/or national identity (e.g. race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation).

In this unit students will explore how race, gender, class, and sexual orientation affect various groups. Students will be examining current/recent examples of oppression. They will examine why they happen and how they happen, as well as the responses to that oppression. Students will also be able to examine the current role of the media in perpetuating oppression. Students identify their own stereotypes, including those that arose in the family narratives they created in Unit 1. Students investigate the history of stereotypes by learning about eugenics and the genetic issues relating to race and racism (Students select and analyze examples of contemporary stereotyping in popular culture (advertisements, television programs, films) to understand how stereotypes are reproduced and perpetuated. Based on these investigations, students produce public service announcements for distribution in their schools that challenge particular stereotypes in terms of institutional, interpersonal, and internalized oppression. What is the dominant narrative in the U.S. regarding ethnicity, race, class and gender? How are dominant narratives formed? How does the mass media shape our lives, and our perceptions of others? How do communities and individuals challenge the dominant narrative?

Overview
This Ethnic Studies course aims to educate students to be politically, socially, and economically conscious about their personal connections to local and global histories. By studying the histories of race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture, students will cultivate respect and empathy for individuals and solidarity with groups of people locally, nationally and globally so as to foster active social engagement and community building. Honoring the historical legacy of social movements and mass struggles against injustice, including the establishment of ethnic studies programs in public schools and university curricula, this course aims to provide an emancipatory education that will inspire students to critically engage in self-determination and seek social justice for all.
Through historical documents and historical interpretations (both print and film), students will be able to (1) discuss their identities, including race, ethnicity, culture, and nationality, (2) describe the ways in which these categories are socially constructed and how they affect students' lives and the lives of others, (3) participate in grassroots community organization, and (4) explain the
98

dynamics among internalized, interpersonal, and institutional oppression and resistance. This course is designed to develop an understanding of how race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture have shaped and continue to shape individuals and society in the United States. The course prepares students to participate in concurrent or subsequent social studies and literature courses with a solid understanding of historical trends and historical thinking. The course develops academic skills in reading, analysis, and writing of historical narratives. The course gives students a broad opportunity to work with and understand the variety of perspectives that shapes the richness and complexity of the United States as well as our city.

Course Content
Introduction: What is Ethnic Studies? (1 week)
Students review or learn the concepts of "historical perspective" and "historiography as power" ("Why is history taught like this?" by Loewen; excerpts from four world history textbooks on Columbus' voyages to the Americas). Students learn the origins of Ethnic Studies as an academic discipline at San Francisco State University in 1969 (San Francisco State: On strike; At 40: Asian American Studies @ San Francisco State). Students learn about the current efforts to ban Ethnic Studies courses in Arizona schools ("Arizona law curbs Ethnic Studies classes" by Mackey).
Unit 1: My Story: Student identity and narratives (3 weeks)
Students (1) analyze the documentary film Race: The Power of an Illusion: Part 2: The Story We Tell to learn the concept of the social construction of race and (2) collect documents of their own history to (3) write a 500-word autobiographical essay in which they reflect on how race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture have shaped their identity.
Unit 2: Historical case study: California Indians and how institutional oppression shapes individual identity (4 weeks)
Students read the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to identify the rights that all humans have been accorded since the mid-20th century. Students examine three sets of excerpts from primary source documents to identify particular rights that were denied to American Indians and the roles that six institutions played in the denial of those rights (economics, education, family,
99

government/law, media, religion). One set of primary source documents is from the Spanish colonial period (Bartolom� de las Casas, Juan Gines de Sepulveda, and Francisco Palou), one set is from the westward expansion of the United States in the first half of the 19th century (Elias Boudinot, John Melish, and John O'Sullivan), and one set is from post-Gold Rush California (newspapers articles reprinted in The Destruction of California Indians). Based on this investigation, students conduct a grand jury investigation to address the question "Who was responsible for the physical and cultural genocide of California Indians?" Following the trial, students view and analyze the film In the White Man's Image to understand efforts to Americanize the surviving Indian population in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by enrolling them in Indian schools. To conclude the unit, students write a 900-word persuasive essay to provide their individual answers to the question investigated by the grand jury.
Unit 3: Stories that shape me: An oral history project (4 weeks)
Students learn the history of oral traditions in cultures around the world and as a research tool in the discipline of Ethnic Studies ("Geographies of displacement" by Mirabal.) Students study examples of recent oral histories (Underground America: Narratives of Undocumented Lives, edited by Orner). Students receive direct instruction on oral history methodology ("Step-by-step Guide to Oral History" by Moyer). Students conduct an oral history interview with a member of their family or another adult important in their lives, focusing on the concepts of race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture. Students transcribe the interview, create a 1,500-word historical narrative from the interview, and present the narrative orally to their classmates.
Unit 4: My Stereotypes: Where stereotypes come from and how they shape my world (4 weeks)
Students identify their own stereotypes, including those that arose in the family narratives they created in Unit 3. Students investigate the history of stereotypes by learning about eugenics and the genetic issues relating to race and racism (textbook, Chapter 3; Race: The Power of an Illusion, Part 1) and by analyzing film portrayals of Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans (Latino Images in Film, film clips from the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center, Ethnic Notions, and The Asian Mystique). Students select and analyze examples of contemporary stereotyping in popular culture (advertisements, television programs, films) to understand how stereotypes are reproduced and perpetuated. Based on these investigations, students produce public service announcements for distribution in their schools that challenge particular stereotypes in terms of institutional, interpersonal, and internalized oppression.
Semester 2: Acting in my world Unit 5: Our communities (5 weeks)
Students expand beyond their study of self and family during the first semester to study community during the second semester. Following an introduction to the various types of communities, students learn about the origins or race- and ethnic-based communities in cities in the United States (The Power of an Illusion, Part 3: The House We Live In) and a model for classifying the various ways in which race- and ethnic-based communities have resisted oppression ("Examining Transformational Resistance" by Solorzano and Bernal). Students
100

apply the concepts of community and resistance they have learned to two historical case studies, Chinatown in San Francisco (Chinatown by Lowe) and Latino barrios in California (Latino USA by Stavans and Alcaraz, and "The Barrioization of Nineteenth-century Mexican Californians" by R�os-Bustamonte). Both case studies include a focus on segregation in education ("Doors to Opportunity" from the textbook for the Tape v. Hurley case in Chinatown and The Lemon Grove Incident for Latino communities). Students evaluate accounts of resistance from the readings and films in relation to Solorzano and Bernal's model of four types of resistance, which include reactionary, self-defeating, conformist, and transformational resistance. Students conclude the unit with a study of Jos� Clemente Orozco's mural The Epic of American Civilization at Dartmouth College and then create their own two-sided piece of art that expresses on one side ways in which oppression controls and constricts communities and on the other side ways in which transformational resistance creates power within communities.
Unit 6: Community organizing (4 weeks)
Building on their knowledge of race- and ethnic-based communities, oppression, and resistance, students are introduced to the concept of community organizing. Students study examples of labor organizing during the Great Depression and World War II among African Americans (Wherever There's a Fight by Elinson and Yogi, the film Golden Lands, Working Hands, and Double Victory by Takaki) and Filipino Americans (the preceding sources plus the film Little Manila and On Becoming Filipino by Bulosan). Students identify oppression in terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and analyze resistance in terms of Solorzano and Bernal's model (see Unit 5). Students perform the play The Romance of Magno Rubio (based on a short story by Bulosan) and then create and perform a five-minute script for a play of their own that expresses their knowledge and feelings about what they have learned about the intersection of community, labor, and race.
Unit 7: Community-based social movements in the 1950s and 1960s (5 weeks)
Students learn how the community organizing that they studied in Unit 6 blossomed into a social movement after World War II. Students study how other racial and ethnic groups joined the civil rights movement initiated by African Americans (excerpts from Eyes on the Prize documentary). They explore the ways in which the ideology of eugenics had influenced the educational system in the United States (textbook, Chapter 5), and then analyze the demands of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, and American Indians to reform the educational system ("Black Panther Party Platform and Program," Oakland Community School, "Plan de Atzl�n," the film Walkout, "On Strike!" by Umemoto, and "A Brief History of the American Indian Movement" by Wittstock and Salinas). Students compare and contrast the demands made by the various groups. Students analyze the efforts of these movements in terms of Solorzano and Bernal's model of resistance (see Unit 5). Students compare educational issues from the 1960s and 1970s with their contemporary educational conditions and produce a manifesto that lists and justifies their demands for reform of the current education system. Students work in groups to put their demands into practice by preparing a lesson for students in a neighboring middle school on one of the topics they have studied in this Ethnic Studies course. The lesson
101

embodies the changes the students would like to see in the educational system. Students teach the lesson to middle school students.
Unit 8: Learning service project (5 weeks, interspersed during Units 5, 6 & 7)
Students build on their knowledge of communities (Unit 5) and community organizing (Unit 6) to design and implement a learning service project with a community organization in their neighborhood. Following a model of investigation and collaboration, students first conduct research on a neighborhood of their choice (either the school neighborhood or the neighborhood where they live). They use census data to create a demographic profile of the neighborhood, consult the city planning department to identify any relevant community studies, and conduct research in the local public library on the history of the neighborhood. They identify community-based organizations within the neighborhood, and, based on the services the organization provides or the issues it addresses, students choose one community organization to work with. Students further develop the oral history skills they learned in Unit 3 by conducting an oral history with an activist in the community organization, with a focus on how the activist became involved with the organization, the nature of the activist's work, and the effects of the activist's involvement on his or her life. Students participate in one event important to the community-based organization and write a report summarizing their experience. The report concludes with ideas on how the student could apply the lessons learned in the learning service project within the school community.

Overview
The purpose of the Ethnic Studies: Academic Language Development 2 course is for Long Term English Learners to learn and apply interdisciplinary academic and literacy skills through a meaningful and relevant use of language applicable to general content courses, career, and college readiness under the ELD and ELA Common Core Standards using an Ethnic Studies and project-based approach. In doing so the students will, through structured instruction, employ the three communicative modes outlined in the California Common Core Standards: Collaboration, Interpretation, and Production of oral and written academic language. Through an Ethnic Studies curriculum framework, students will learn and apply grade-level academic language, knowledge, and skills in meaningful and relevant ways. By reading and analyzing comparative and expository literature students will examine the history, language, values, and voices of diverse groups within the United States. Students will also identify common issues across groups, and critically analyze, reflect on, and participate (written and orally) in the study of those issues social and culturally relevant issues.
Through primary sources and historical interpretations (in print, film and music), students will research and articulate their identity as both an individual and a member of an intersection of ethnic and cultural groups as they explore their Educational Journeys, this will also evaluate their literacy skills in reading, writing, speaking, and listening (unit 1), analyze text structures, purpose, and audience by examining various stereotypes and their effect on identity, examine how underrepresented groups celebrate their cultural and ethnic heritage through novels, film, and other media (unit 2), compare and evaluate oral histories and primary documents as an alternative to mainstream media's representation of experiences relating to how laws and language has affect generational differences and practicing the exchange of information and ideas to make an analysis (unit 3), evaluate academic language for sociolinguistic purposes of the movements using primary documents of social justice movements and multicultural coalitions to evaluate language, literacy, and home skills as tools to create change (units 4), justify social movements' strategies to build political and social alliances, students will apply literacy skills and cooperative learning strategies to develop a Youth Participatory Action Project (unit 5-6).
This course is designed to provide key academic language, historical lessons and critical literacy skills that empower students to articulate and address the social injustices they see and experience. Students will study a wide variety of perspectives in order to foster cooperation and understanding across ethnic and cultural boundaries, celebrating the multitude of ways people of all backgrounds contribute to United States history. This course prepares students for concurrent and subsequent courses in social studies and literature by developing academic skills in reading, critical analysis and writing and by establishing a firm historical understanding of the development of ethnic identity in the United States. This ultimately enables students to

Course Content
This course is designed to provide key academic language, historical lessons and critical literacy skills that empower students to articulate and address the social injustices they see and experience. This course is linked to Common Core Social Studies and English Standards, and the California English Language Development State Standards. Students will be able to demonstrate literacy skills using an Ethnic Studies curriculum through the:
Cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of primary and secondary sources, connecting insights gained from specific details to an understanding of the text as a whole. Aligned with ELD standards students will be: Analyzing how writers and speakers use vocabulary and other language resources for specific purposes (to explain, persuade, entertain, etc.) depending on modality, text type, purpose, audience, topic, and content area. This will be assessed in their writing assignments (two 500-word essays) for their reading of the supplementary books and through Socratic seminars and group discussions. (Units 1-3).
Determine the central ideas or information of a primary or secondary source; provide an accurate summary that makes clear the relationships among the key details and ideas. Students will analyze how writers and speakers language resources depending on modality, text type, purpose, audience, and topic. Offer and justify opinions using academic language through structured discussions and written assignments. This will be assessed through the Educational Journeys PowerPoint presentation in Unit 1 and the jigsaw activities in Units 2 and 4.
Evaluate various explanations for key concepts in each assigned unit and determine which explanation best accords with textual evidence, acknowledging where the text leaves matters uncertain. This will be assessed through classroom discussion (via productive discussions using foldables, gallery walks, large and small group discussions and exit slips, 1-page reflections in all units that accompany readings), writing assignments: 250-word critical analysis of their choice of song lyrics, making 3 connections to the analysis from class, journals written from the perspective of different groups in social movements.
Integrate and evaluate multiple sources of information presented in diverse formats and media in order to address an essential question within a unit. Analyzing how writers and speakers use
104

vocabulary and other language resources for specific purposes. This will be assessed through each writing assignment: 1,000-word autobiographical essay, 500-word stereotype analysis, Pop-Up history Project, two 1,500-word oral history research papers, 500-word reflections after each program implemented through their Participatory Action Research Project, 1,000-word research paper on a social justice movement, 2,000-word cumulative reflection after the social studies lesson.

Conduct research projects based on essential questions, demonstrating understanding of key learning outcomes. Identify text structures and features through the study of literary, critical and historical texts that promote student's positive self-images and validate students' home cultures, stories and identities. This will be assessed through the following writing assignments: two 1,500-word oral history research papers, 1,000-word research paper on a social justice movement.
Gather relevant information from multiple print and digital sources, assess the credibility and accuracy of each source, and integrate the informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research. Students will write literacy and informational texts to present, describe, and explain ideas and information, using academic language and appropriate technology. 1,000word autobiographical essay, 500-word stereotype analysis, the design of a pamphlet, two 1,500-word oral history research papers, 500-word reflections after each program implemented through their service-learning project, 1,000-word research paper on a social justice movement, 2,000-word cumulative reflection after the social studies lesson.
Practice writing, reading, speaking, and listening strategies through text genres that promotes cultural, historical and critical understanding of, and empathy for, a variety of cultures and experiences in America.
Each unit has multiple opportunities to evaluate student writing and course content understanding. Furthermore, Educational Journey presentation (Unit 1), group presentation of information (Unit 2), oral history interviews (Units 3 and 5), public awareness campaigns (Units 2, 3), Participatory Action Research (Units 4 and 5), a middle school social studies lesson (Unit 6), current event journals, community participation reflections, and short answer reading quizzes. Students will be informally assessed through student lead discussion; Socratic seminars, large and small group discussions, and exit slips.
Unit 1. Assessing Literacy Skills: Educational Journey-The Formation of Ethnic Identity
105

How as my educational journey and life experiences shape who I am?
Students will learn about how Ethnic Studies is both "identity-based" and also a "critical theory of power" that interrogates multiple structures of hierarchy and inequality ("Ethnic Studies: Theorizing Multiculturalism, Diversity, and Power" by Marable) in order to understand the links between racism, sexism, homophobia and power. Students will then chart their own intersectionality as a basis for further inquiry in the study of how and why they are shaped by individual experience and group membership. Students will understand the link between place and identity in order to begin our case study on the impact hierarchies of power in Citrus Heights, CA have on cultural and ethnic identity.
Students will then analyze the variety of ways identity is defined, created and contested linking the following topics back to hierarchies and power: Students will then analyze the variety of ways identity is defined, created and contested linking the following topics back to hierarchies and power: Label's and Identity: Dr. Victor Rios' book Street Life: Poverty, Gangs, and a PhD. Zinn's A People's History of the United States Chapters 1-3. Music videos and lyrics from songs about the Sacramento area to further deconstruct ethnic identity as tied to place (Music videos and lyrics from local artists). Students will then write a 250-word critical analysis of their choice of song lyrics about Sacramento, making 3 connections to the analysis from class. Poetry about "claiming" Sacramento and how residency and belonging forge an ethnic and cultural identity (Poems by local artists, such as Jose Montoya from the Royal Chicano Air Force, members from Zero Forbidden Goals, poems written by other youth from the Sacramento Area Youth Speaks). Students will emulate the style of the poets and develop their own style, writing a poem about life in Citrus Heights/Sacramento Area. Movies and the significance of Neo-Realism as a form of authentic representation in contrast to the "Hollywood Myth" (Los Angeles Plays Itself. Dir. Thom Andersen. Plays from local Sacramento Theater: Teatro Espejo) Students will write a 1-page reflection about the ways movies shape the way they see the city. The history of the Sacramento area from native communities to Spanish Colonization, Rancheros, development, redlining and gentrification (direct instruction). Students will practice using Cornell-style notes. Geography �Students will first draw their own maps of Citrus Heights and Sacramento area based on their perception of where they believe different ethnicities and socioeconomic classes live. They will then compare these maps with maps derived from 2010 census data. They will then write a 1-page reflection on the similarities and differences between their perceptions of geography and the realities based in data, linking this back to how geography shapes ethnic and cultural identity. Students will create and present a 25-30 slide Multi-Media Presentation in groups of 4 that explains the correlation between ethnic and cultural identity formation, power hierarchies and one the following topics (student choice): art, music, language, food, environment, politics, violence, jobs, technology, literature. During presentations, students will take notes for subsequent use in their autobiographical essays. The presentation also helps students develop public speaking and listening skills in a safe environment. These skills will support students in their second semester service-learning project of teaching a social studies lesson at the middle school level. See Key Assignments section for more detailed information on that assignment. The unit will culminate with a 1,000-word autobiographical essay on how their identity is shaped by any of the following aspects of Sacramento: history, art, movies,
106

music, language, oral history, geography, food, economic and political opportunity, and literature. Students will draw key vocabulary and cultural context from their notes, poem and 1page reflections from the unit to help them articulate the scope and complexity of factors that influence identity as both an individual level and as a member of an intersection of groups.
Unit 2. Text Structures, Purpose, and Audience: Inventing Images, Representing Otherness
How is identity created, contested and altered?
Students will be introduced to the concept critical race theory as they highlight and discuss the Morris reading in small groups. (Morris, Wesley. "Fast Forward: Why a movie about car thieves is the most progressive force in American cinema."). This essay will serve as a model for each student's subsequent critical analysis of stereotypes in various mediums. Students will then learn how scholars and critiques deconstruct Latino (Latino Images in Film), African American (Ethnic Notions, Good Hair, Madea's Witness Protection trailer) and Native American stereotypes (Video clips: The Savage, Arrowhead trailer, Avatar trailer, Dances with Wolves trailer, The Last Samurai trailer, trailer) and evaluate the validity of these critiques (in regards to their autobiographical essays from the previous unit) in large and small group discussions. They will examine the intersection between the representation of gender and ethnicity (Miss Representation) and then compare these portrayals with examples of films directed and starring underrepresented groups (Smoke Signals) and understand strategies to disrupt the negative effects (such as internalized oppression and the justification of violence) caused by stereotypes (Brainwashed: Challenging the Myth of Black Inferiority by Burrell; "The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain" by Hughes) through a foldable activity that compares and contrasts these strategies. Students will then use the readings and coursework as a model for critical analysis. Students will select an example from contemporary popular culture and then write a 500-word analysis of how it either perpetuates or subverts stereotypes.
Students will then trace the historical and economic roots of these stereotypes and their effects on identity and representation through reading Caliban and Other Essays and a group project. In groups of 4, students will engage in a jigsaw activity from an assigned chapter from A Different Mirror (Chapters 3-8). Students are responsible for summarizing their assigned section in 3 key points and will then design a physical activity or perform a skit to present the information to the class. The physical activity or skit along with the paraphrased delivery of key terms and concepts will engage students in the subject matter and allow students of different learning styles to access the information. Building off the presentation from Unit 1, students will continue to develop their public speaking and listening skills, empowering students to find their voice and take initiative in their own education and the education of others (both in this unit and again in their service-learning projects). By the end of the series of presentations, students will have at least 8-pages of notes that will be used in future activities.
Students will then work in groups of 3 or 4 to synthesize their knowledge of history (using their presentation notes) and their critical analysis of popular culture (500-word analysis) to create a pamphlet for distribution in their school (in the 9th grade Freshman Seminar class) that
107

challenges ethnic and gender stereotypes and offers strategies for disrupting and subverting the negative effects of stereotyping (including alternative forms of representation in the media and suggestions for further reading). This project begins the process of fulfilling the course purpose in that students will apply what they have learned towards direct action, implementing a systematized campaign for social justice at their school.
Unit 3. Exchanging information and Ideas: Language and Law - Oral History Project (5 Weeks)
How does law and language affect generational differences?
In this unit, students will compare and evaluate oral histories as an alternative to mainstream media's representation of ethnicity by conducting their own oral history research. Students will first understand the differences and similarities different groups experiences and build empathy and understanding of various experiences from World War II (A Different Mirror Chapter 14). Students will evaluate the language that was used in history for different laws and legal outcomes for various ethnic groups in the U.S. In this process, students will explore the relationships between previous generations and their modern generation by reading the chapter and writing a diary entry for each sub-section in the chapter (6 total: Japanese Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Jewish Americans) from the perspective of a person of that group during that time period. Students will then learn how oral history can be used as a tool for research ("Colonize This!" and "FemmeInism: Lessons of My Mother" from Hernandez; "Fathers, Daughters, Citizens, and Strongwomen El hambre y el orgullo" from Tobar) and compare the experiences from the readings to that of the stereotypical images from the previous unit in small and large group discussions. In small groups of 4, students research recent examples of oral histories (Yell-Oh Girls) that are in written form, and compare them with recorded oral histories (StoryCorps), students will express their findings in a silent carousel activity, to further illustrate and unpack the significance of the acoustic impact of oral history.
Students conduct an oral history interview with a member of their family or another adult important in their lives (using the "Great Questions List" or "Question Generator" from StoryCorps.org or by developing their own questions based on their autobiographical essay from Unit 1), focusing on the concepts of ethnicity, nationality, language and culture. Students will transcribe the interview and then write a 1,500-word historical narrative from that transcription. Students will then present the narrative to their classmates. This presentation may either by from memory, or students may record and edit their interview using the open source web software Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to incorporate music and sound effects. The presentation will focus not only on the storytelling aspect, but also on the method, of how oral history can be used as a tool for research � of how this research subverts and counteracts the destructive stereotypes discussed in the previous unit.
Unit 4. Practicing academic language for sociolinguistic purposes (e.g., disagreeing, agreeing, questioning, and adding ideas during discussions and in writing): Civil Rights Movements for Ethnic Minorities in the U.S
108

How do the Civil Rights Movements use language and skills as a tool for their cause?
A major focus of the second semester is to take the lessons learned from the previous semester, and put them into direct action. Students will engage in two projects that service their school community, while simultaneously learning about how social change was implemented in the past � so that they can better implement it in the present. During Units 4 and 5 students will work in groups of 6-8 to establish and implement a social justice program at their school. This program will last between 4-6 weeks and consist of activities and/or events founded around the principles and themes addressed within the course. For more information on these two projects, please see the Key Assignments section.
The focus of Unit 4 will be to provide students with models of social justice movements to guide their own social justice initiatives. In this unit students will learn why these movements were formed and what they accomplished. Linking back to what students learned about intersectionality in the first unit, students will learn about the shared struggles of women, African Americans, and gays and lesbians (Supplemental materials from RethinkingSchools.org and Zinnedproject.org) as each group fought for social justice. To engage the material, students will participate in a jigsaw activity similar to the jigsaw activity in Unit 2. However, this jigsaw activity will build upon the skills developed in the previous activity by doubling the groups up on each chapter. Students will take notes as they did in the previous jigsaw, and also fill out exit slips for each presentation. This will allow students to evaluate not only the content of the lesson, but also on the effectiveness of their delivery. This will ultimately prepare them for their work in the service-learning projects in Units 4 and 5.
Students will also study how to gain political power through activism, organization and mobilization. Students will learn about the historical roots of the Chicano movement and how Chicanas grappled with racial hostility and sexual politics as they empowered themselves to find their own voice and perspective on campuses and in the Chicano movement ("Chicana Insurgencies: Stories of Transformation, Youth Rebellion, and Chicana Campus Organizing" from Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement), examine the role people of mixed-race play in anti-racist activism ("Organizing 101: A Mixed-Race Feminist in Movements for Social Justice" from Colonize This!), and compare and contrast various social justice party platforms ("The Black Panther Party Platform 1966"; "The Brown Berets: Young Chicano Revolutionaries" from FightBack! News; "Asian-American Nationalism in the Age of Black Power, 1966-1975" from Souls Journal; "A Brief History of the American Indian Movement" from the American Indian Movement Grand Governing Council). This will be done through analyzing the reading in large and small group discussions. Using the information from the readings and their notes, students will design a "how-to-guide" or "comic" that illustrates the process that one of the social justice groups went through to enact social change. The "how-toguides" will be distributed at their school site in order to motivate other students to get involved in working towards social justice.
The unit will culminate in a written assessment where students will synthesize the information from their notes, the reading and their how-to-guide into a 1,000-word research paper that
109

analyzes why a social justice movement formed, what contributions they made, and how they implemented successful strategies for social change. This written response will synthesize primary and secondary sources from class readings and will respond to one of the essential questions from the unit.
Unit 5. Cooperative Learning Strategies and Justifying: Common Goals
How do groups build political and social alliances?
Continuing their work in serving the school community, students will begin to implement their projects during this unit. Students will shift their focus from studying civil rights groups, towards studying labor rights groups and anti-war protesters and introduce the concept of community organizing. Students will study examples of labor organizations during the Great Depression and World War II (Videos: Golden Lands, Working Hands Part 2: No Danger From Strikes Among Them, Part 3: Bombs and Ballot Boxes, Part 9: Against the Tide) and during the 1970's (Harlan County, U.S.A.). Students will compare and contrast these examples and analyze how unions can be used to build communities across ethnic and cultural boundaries through large and small group discussion. Students will then compare and contrast labor organization to antiwar protests (Readings: Chapter 18 "The Impossible Victory: Vietnam", other supplemental articles from zinnedproject.org) through a 1-page reflection. Students will then discuss the way anti-war protests unite communities across ethnic boundaries through large and small group discussion.
Ultimately, students will research whether these methods of community organization are still relevant today by interviewing a union representative, a veteran or an anti-war protestor. Students will transcribe the interview and write a 1,500-word reflection on the connections between the interview, their studies and their own service-learning project.
Unit 6. Our Community: Using Literacy Strategies to Evaluate and Analyze
How does intersectionality affect political and social power in our community?
At this juncture, students will shift focus towards working on their second group project where they will apply their knowledge from their previous social justice campaign, and from all of the units covered throughout both semesters, to create a 20-minute interactive middle school social studies lesson that celebrates the diversity of our school and encourages middle schoolers to participate in making their school (and eventually our school) a safe space and place of equality. During this unit, students will revisit their work with intersectionality in order to guide their lesson planning � helping them strive towards a social studies lesson that is inclusive, rather than exclusive. Students will then create a lesson plan using backwards design that is aligned to middle school social studies standards. To gather feedback in order to make adjustments to their lesson and to gauge the success of their lesson, students will create an exit slip to check for understanding in order to determine the success of their lesson.
110

Interspersed through this planning process, students will understand how intersectionality affects the social, economic and political power of individuals within their own ethnic group and in relation to other ethnic groups by reading Chapter 12: "The Convergence of Passing Zones: Multiracial Gays, Lesbians, and Bisexuals of Asian Descent" from The Sum of our Parts: Mixed Heritage Asian Americans; "Minotaur", "Gift Giving", "Wayward", "The Anthropologists' Kids" from Mixed: An Anthology of Short Fiction on the Multiracial Experience; Chapter 13 "Sangu Du Sangu Meu: Growing up Black and Italian in a Time of White Flight" from Are Italians White?: How Race is Made in America. As students read, they will keep a journal. After each assignment, students will write a 1-page reflection that links the take-home message from each reading towards the social justice curriculum they are developing as a group. Students will discuss these readings and their 1-page reflections in their small groups. These reflections will help students tailor their lesson towards inclusion of all aspects of students' identities.
Before students present at the middle school, they will teach their lesson to their class to practice, and gain feedback from exit slips and to make adjustments to their lesson. After the lesson at the middle school, students will individually write a 2,000-word reflection about their experience planning, teaching and analyzing the exit slips, connecting their lesson and their rational for their implementation to key concepts learned throughout the year in ethnic studies.
Writing Assignments
Unit 1 Students will write a minimum 250-word critical analysis of their choice of song lyrics about Sacramento, making 3 connections to the analysis from class. Students will emulate local artists or develop their own style, writing a poem about life in Citrus Heights. Students will write a 1-page reflection about the ways movies shape the way they see the city. Students will write a 1-page reflection on the similarities and differences between their perceptions of geography and the realities based in data, linking this back to how geography shapes ethnic and cultural identity. The unit will culminate with a minimum 1,000-word autobiographical essay on how their identity is shaped by any of the following aspects of Sacramento: history, art, movies, music, language, oral history, geography, food, economic and political opportunity, and literature. Students will draw key vocabulary and cultural context from their notes, poem and 1-page reflections from the unit to help them articulate the scope and complexity of factors that influence identity as both an individual level and as a member of an intersection of groups.
Unit 2 Their first independent reading assignment is due midway through this unit, where they will write a minimum 500-word reflection in which they synthesize the themes and central issues from 2 discussions from previous blog posts and 2 readings or class discussions from their current unit. This assignment adds empathic perspective and therefore compliments the examples from history and popular culture. Students will select an example from contemporary popular culture and then write a minimum 500-word analysis of how it either perpetuates or subverts stereotypes.
Unit 3 Students will explore the relationships between previous generations and their modern generation by reading the chapter and writing a diary entry for each sub-section in the chapter
111

(6 total: Japanese Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans,) from the perspective of a person of that group during that time period. Supplemental readings will include incorporating Russian Americans, Ukrainian Americans, to include our student demographics. Their second independent reading assignment is due midway through this unit, where they will write a minimum 500-word reflection in which they synthesize the themes and central issues from 2 discussions from previous blog posts and 2 readings or class discussions from their current unit. This assignment builds off the previous independent reading assignment in that the outside reading texts (to a certain degree) show the struggle of generational difference. The oral history project seeks to build bridges across generational difference and facilitate dialogue, so that students may learn from their family's (or close adult's) rich cultural traditions and heritage. Students will transcribe the interview with a family member or other close adult figure in their life and then write a minimum 1,500-word historical narrative from that transcription. Students will then present the narrative to their classmates.
Unit 1-3 Students will write a minimum 500-word essay that summarizes, responds to, makes connections with and asks questions of a current event article. They will then lead the class in a short (5 minute) class discussion on the implications of the event, and the connections to discussions, key terms, historical events and readings from the current unit. Students will write a minimum 500-word reflection that summarizes their experience, and explains what they liked and didn't like about the event to be turned in by the end of the semester � this will inform their programming work during second semester.
Unit 4 The unit will culminate in a written assessment where students will synthesize the information from their notes, the reading and their how-to-guide into a minimum 1,000-word research paper that analyzes why a social justice movement formed, how language affected law/s, what contributions they made, and how they implemented successful strategies for social change. This written response will synthesize primary and secondary sources from class readings and will respond to one of the essential questions from the unit.
Unit 5 After each activity and/or event in their participatory action project, students will write a minimum 500-word reflection that summarizes the successes and failures of their group, and themselves. This will help shape the success of their next activity and/or event in relation to the group's specific and measurable goals and mission statement. The amount of completed reflections will be dependent upon the amount planned by the group, as actions and/or activities will depend upon their scale and goal. Students will compare and contrast these examples and analyze how unions can be used to build communities across ethnic and cultural boundaries through large and small group discussion. Students will then compare and contrast labor organization to anti-war protests through a 1-page reflection. Students will transcribe the interview with a veteran, union member or anti-war activist and write a minimum 1,500-word reflection on the connections between the interview, their studies and their own service-learning project.

Unit 6 As students read, they will keep a journal. After each assignment, students will write a 1page reflection that links the take-home message from each reading towards the social justice curriculum they are developing as a group After the lesson at the middle school, students will individually write a 2,000-word reflection about their experience planning, teaching and analyzing the exit slips, connecting their lesson and their rational for their implementation to key concepts learned throughout the year in ethnic studies.
Instruction Focus
One of the main focuses of ethnic studies is translating historical lessons and critical race theory into direct action for social justice. In this section I will address the instructional methods used to develop the content knowledge and skills necessary for student empowerment and social action on a school and community level. While direct instruction and modeling are used to introduce new concepts (such as defining intersectionality and tracing Native American history in Sacramento in Unit 1, defining critical race theory, stereotypes and internalized and externalized oppression in Unit 2), learning will also take place through small and large group discussion. Varying group size from pairs to quads to groups of 6 will allow for intimacy and participation in a variety of ways, thus giving students of different comfort levels the ability to participate and engage in the curriculum. This helps build the community, trust and empathy necessary to have honest discussions about subjects that may be uncomfortable for students to otherwise discuss. This is especially true for students who are addressing their own privileges and disadvantages. Because building empathy and fostering alliances and solidarity are paramount to social justice work, inward refection through journaling (especially coupled with reading assignments) and dialogue that both systematically develops student voices and active listening skills are used widely throughout each unit.
In Unit 1, students begin by charting their identities. This topic is already familiar to all of our students in that Freshman Seminar (a class mandatory for all freshman) begins with a unit on identity and the "us vs. them" dichotomy. This activity therefore acts as an "into" activity for students, allowing them to attach new information to what they already know. They will then enhance their understanding of their identity through the variety of 1-page reflections, readings, discussions and group work (Multi-Media Presentation) within the unit. The progression of assignments and careful reflection throughout the unit will culminate with a writing assignment, which will serve as the beginning of their ability to articulate their own identity and allow them to empathize with others, recognize their privilege and work towards understanding the systems that cause inequality in their school and their city. Intersection will be revisited again through reflection and group discussion in Units 2, 4 and 6. Revisiting this concept through discussion will act as a "spiral staircase," allowing students to further reflect and refine their understanding of how hierarchies of power can cause internal and external conflicts.
Developing group work skills and the content knowledge for why and how a group functions is key towards collective action for social justice. That is why students work in groups in a variety of ways: present Multi-Media Presentation (Unit 1), jigsaw activities (Unit 2 and 4), public awareness campaigns (Unit 2), and oral history research projects (Unit 3) and literature circles
113

(throughout Units 1-3). Many of these group projects focus on teaching and presentation skills, which ultimately help students develop public speaking and listening skills in a safe environment. These skills will support students in their second semester service-learning projects (the campaign in Units 4 and 5), especially in terms of presenting the social studies lesson at the middle school level. Because Ethnic Studies is a multi-disciplinary course, students will access and present content knowledge in a variety of ways. In jigsaw activities (Unit 2 and 4) students will present information to the class through a physical activity or skit, in Unit 3 and 5 students will research and present oral history projects, with the option to either present from memory or to mix and edit the interview into a sound file. In Unit 2 students will design and distribute a pamphlet and in Unit 4 students will design and distribute a "how-toguide" or a comic book. These activities allow students of a variety of learning styles to access the material, and then demonstrate their mastery.
In many ways, the instructional methods parallel the progression of topics from unit to unit, contributing towards student empowerment on an individual level in Semester 1 and the activation of that empowerment towards social justice in Semester 2. Where students first learn about the factors that shape identity in Unit 1, they are reflecting and working in groups to better understand themselves, to move towards self-actualization. They then build on that knowledge in Unit 2 by tracing the historical and economic roots of stereotypes and how they impact identity through an increasing amount of collaboration. Where students are writing essays in Unit 1 in order to articulate their point of view, students are working collaboratively to disseminate the information they have learned about how to counteract stereotypes in Unit 2. In Unit 3 students then explore how oral histories are used as a research tool to further counteract stereotypical forms of representation. This research empowers students to claim their own histories and curate more accurate forms of representation. Unit 4 begins with the translation of lessons from social justice movements towards the application of these concepts in a servicelearning program at their school site � this work is made possible through the groundwork of the individual reflection and group work skills cultivated by their first semester's work. This work also builds upon the current event presentations and community participation activities. When students literally bridge the gap between their community, current events and the curriculum, they can better understand how what they learn fits into the world around them. Unit 5 builds off of Unit 4 in that students will be implementing their service-learning program. To assist in their refinement of their program, students will continue to read and write reflections connecting lessons learned in the classroom to their direct action in their school community. These systematized metacognitive exercises assist students in analyzing their group's process, to ultimately determine whether that process is helping them achieve their goal. The culminating activity in Unit 5 is another oral history project, but this time with the focus is not on how oral histories influence our sense of self, but on analyzing effective methods for community organization (connecting the work of veterans, union members or anti-war activists to the work students have done at our school). Again, students are reflecting in groups, and connecting what they learn about effect forms of community organization to their own practice. Lastly, students will synthesize all of the content knowledge, experience and skills gained throughout the class to present a social studies lesson at the middle school level. This culminating
114

assignment is the marriage of theory and practice, allowing students to take charge of not only their own education, but to take part in the education of others.
Reading Circles
Independent reading and literature circles are an integral part of the class, as Ethnic Studies emphasizes an interdisciplinary method as a means to unpack the intersections of race, gender, sexuality and class. The independent reading will be interspersed throughout the first semester, with one book completed per 9 weeks. Students will take part in weekly discussions in literature circles. Students will bring 2 discussion questions to the group (1 level 2 question and 1 level 3 question). Students will record their discussions on the course website in the form of a blog post. Students will take turns as weekly recorders. These blog posts will form the basis for their written reflections once they have completed the text.
Desired Learning Outcomes: Students will make connections between cultural texts (literature, art, music), their studies and their lives. Students will cultivate a positive self-image and have their stories, cultures and identities validated and promoted through literary, critical and historical texts. Students will bridge differences and gain a greater cultural, historical and critical understanding of, and empathy for, a variety of cultures and experiences in America.
Assessments: Students will take part in weekly discussions in literature circles. Students will bring 2 discussion questions to the group (1 level 2 question and 1 level 3 question). Students will record their discussions on the course website in the form of a blog post. Students will take turns as weekly recorders. A pacing guide for each text insures that students know what chapters they need to read each week. At the end of each 9-week period, students will write a 500-word reflection in which they synthesize the themes and central issues from 2 discussions from previous blog posts and 2 readings or class discussions from their current unit.
Current Events Journal
In order for students to become engaged members of the community, and effective and active participants in the democratic process, students must be engaged in discussions on the events that affect them at a local, state, national and international level.
Desired Learning Outcomes: Students will become engaged members of the community. Students will be informed on current local, state, national and international events so that they may be effective and active members of the democratic process.
Assessments: Students will present a brief (1-2 minute) overview of a current event of their choice to the class 1 time per semester. Before their presentation, they will write a 500-word essay that summarizes, responds to, makes connections with and asks questions of the article. They will then lead the class in a short (5 minute) class discussion on the implications of the event, and the connections to discussions, key terms, historical events and readings from the current unit.
115

Community Participation
In order to foster ties to the community, network, and support local and school programming, students must attend two community events per semester.
Desired Learning Outcomes: Students will foster ties to the community and network with community members, bridging the gap between the school and the community. Students will support local and school programming.
Assessments: Students will write a 500-word reflection that summarizes their experience, and explains what they liked and didn't like about the event to be turned in by the end of the semester � this will inform their programming work during second semester.
Unit 1 Representing Los Angeles: The Formation of Ethnic Identity
Students will chart their own intersectionality as a basis for further inquiry in the study of how and why they are shaped by individual experience and group membership. Students will write a 250-word critical analysis of their choice of song lyrics about Los Angeles, making 3 connections to the analysis from class. Students will emulate Healy's style or develop their own style, writing a poem about life in Santa Monica. Students will write a 1-page reflection about the ways movies shape the way they see the city. Students will practice using Cornell-style notes. Students will first draw their own maps Sacramento and Citrus Heights based on their perception of where they believe different ethnicities and socio-economic classes live. They will then compare these maps with maps derived from 2010 census data. They will then write a 1page reflection on the similarities and differences between their perceptions of geography and the realities based in data, linking this back to how geography shapes ethnic and cultural identity. Students will create and present a 25-30 slide PowerPoint Presentation in groups of 4 that explains the correlation between ethnic and cultural identity formation, power hierarchies and one the following topics (student choice): art, music, language, food, environment, politics, violence, jobs, technology, literature. During presentations, students practice Cornel-Style notes. The unit will culminate with a 1,000-word autobiographical essay on how their identity is shaped by any of the following aspects of Sacramento: history, art, movies, music, language, oral history, geography, food, economic and political opportunity, and literature. Students will draw key vocabulary and cultural context from their notes from the unit to help them articulate their identity as an individual and member of an intersection of groups.
Unit 2 Stereotypes and Representation
Students will select an example of contemporary popular culture and then write a 500-word analysis of how it either perpetuates or subverts stereotypes. Students will then trace the historical and economic roots of these stereotypes and their effects on identity and representation through reading Caliban and Other Essays and a group project. In groups of 4, students will engage in a jigsaw activity from an assigned chapter from A Different Mirror (Chapters 3-8). Students are responsible for summarizing their assigned section in 3 key points
116

and will then design a physical activity or perform a skit to present the information to the class. The physical activity or skit along with the paraphrased delivery of key terms and concepts will engage students in the subject matter and allow students of different learning styles to access the information. Building off the presentation from Unit 1, students will continue to develop their public speaking and listening skills, empowering students to find their voice and take initiative in their own education and the education of others (both in this unit and again in their servicelearning projects). By the end of the series of presentations, students will have 8-pages of notes. Their first independent reading assignment is due midway through this unit, where they will write a 500-word reflection in which they synthesize the themes and central issues from 2 discussions from previous blog posts and 2 readings or class discussions from their current unit. This assignment adds empathic perspective and therefore compliments the examples from history and popular culture. Students will then work in groups of 3 or 4 to synthesize their knowledge of history (using their presentation notes) and their critical analysis of popular culture (500-word analysis) to create a pamphlet for distribution in their school (in the 9th grade Freshman Seminar class) that challenges ethnic and gender stereotypes and offers strategies for disrupting and subverting the negative effects of stereotyping (including alternative forms of representation in the media and suggestions for further reading). This project begins the process of fulfilling the course purpose in that students will apply what they have learned towards direct action, implementing a systematized campaign for social justice at their school.
Unit 3 Oral History Project Students will explore the relationships between previous generations and their modern generation by reading the chapter and writing a diary entry for each sub-section in the chapter (6 total: Japanese Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Jewish Americans) from the perspective of a person of that group during that time period. Their second independent reading assignment is due midway through this unit, where they will write a 500-word reflection in which they synthesize the themes and central issues from 2 discussions from previous blog posts and 2 readings or class discussions from their current unit. This assignment builds off the previous independent reading assignment in that the outside reading texts (to a certain degree) show the struggle of generational difference. The oral history project seeks to build bridges across generational difference and facilitate dialogue, so that students may learn from their family's (or close adult's) rich cultural traditions and heritage. In small groups of 4, students research recent examples of oral histories (Yell-Oh Girls) that are in written form, and compare them with recorded oral histories (StoryCorps), students will express their findings in a silent carousel activity, to further illustrate and unpack the significance of the acoustic impact of oral history. Students conduct an oral history interview with a member of their family or another adult important in their lives (using the "Great Questions List" or "Question Generator" from StoryCorps.org or by developing their own questions based on their autobiographical essay from Unit 1), focusing on the concepts of ethnicity, nationality, language and culture. Students will transcribe the interview and then write a 1,500-word historical narrative from that transcription. Students will then present the narrative to their classmates. This presentation may either by from memory, or students may record and edit their interview using the open source web software Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) to incorporate music and sound effects. The presentation will focus not only on the storytelling aspect, but also on the method, of how
117

oral history can be used as a tool for research � of how this research subverts and counteracts the destructive stereotypes discussed in the previous unit.
Unit 4 Social Justice and Civil Rights Movements Semester 2 Group Project: (Interspersed through Units 4 and 5. Weeks 1-12) Activism and action is a heavy focus of ethnic studies. It is not simply enough to learn about historical moments and agents of social justice, students must be empowered to be agents of social justice here at SAMOHI. The teacher will select groups of 6-8 students. These groups will work cooperatively to establish and implement a social justice program. This program will last 4-6 weeks and consist of activities and/or events founded around the principles and themes addressed within the ethnic studies course.
Desired Learning Outcomes: Students will develop agency and become empowered to create social change. Students will apply their knowledge of strategies from both historical and current models of social change to develop and implement a social justice campaign which may be any combination of the following: an activity, an organized protest or action, a guest speaker, a panel of speakers, an assembly, a play, a documentary, a workshop, an information leaflet, a school board proposal, an advertising campaign, a community service project, or a research study. Students are by no means limited to the previous list; they serve merely as examples of actions or events that might be implemented throughout the course of their campaign. Students will take ownership over their educational outcomes by designing the parameters of their success (goals must be specific and measurable). Students will understand how to run a campus or social organization by maintaining a clear vision through creation of a mission statement, establishing clearly defined roles for each member of the team and creating procedures and a timeline to achieve their goals.
Assessments: Each group will create a mission statement. Each group will create a list of specific and measurable goals. Each group will create a specific list of clearly defined roles for each group member. Each group will create a timeline and set of procedures for completing each activity and/or event. After each activity and/or event, students will write a 500-word reflection that summarizes the successes and failures of their group, and themselves. This will help shape the success of their next activity and/or event in relation to the group's specific and measurable goals and mission statement. The amount of completed reflections will be dependent upon the amount planned by the group, as actions and/or activities will depend upon their scale and goal. To engage the material, students will participate in a jigsaw activity similar to the jigsaw activity in Unit 2. However, this jigsaw activity will build upon the skills developed in the previous activity by doubling the groups up on each chapter. Students will take notes as they did in the previous jigsaw, and also fill out exit slips for each presentation. This will allow students to evaluate not only the content of the lesson, but also on the effectiveness of their delivery. This will ultimately prepare them for their work in the service-learning projects in Units 4 and 5. Using the information from the readings, students will design a "how-to-guide" or "comic" that illustrates the process that one of the social justice groups went through to enact social change. The "how-to-guides" will be distributed at their school site in order to motivate other students to get involved in working towards social justice. Students will synthesize the information from their notes, the reading and their how-to-guide into a 1,000-word research
118

paper that analyzes why a social justice movement formed, what contributions they made, and how they implemented successful strategies for social change. This written response will synthesize primary and secondary sources from class readings and will respond to one of the essential questions from the unit.
Unit 5 In addition to the service-learning project, students will participate in the following assignments: Students will compare and contrast these examples and analyze how unions can be used to build communities across ethnic and cultural boundaries through large and small group discussion. Students will then compare and contrast labor organization to anti-war protests through a 1-page reflection. Students will interview a union representative, a veteran or an anti-war protestor. Students will transcribe the interview and write a 1,500-word reflection on the connections between the interview, their studies and their own service-learning project.
Unit 6 All Mixed Up! Living on the Intersections of Identity Semester 2 Group Project: Middle School Social Studies Lesson (interspersed through Unit 6. Weeks 13-18). Students will apply their knowledge from their previous social justice campaign, and from all of the units covered throughout both semesters, to create a 20-minute interactive middle school social studies lesson that celebrates the diversity of our school and encourages middle schoolers to participate in making their school (and eventually our school) a safe space and place of equality.
Teaching future generations of students and establishing a consistent message about what our students care about, and what our students are dedicated to, is paramount to the continued success of both ethnic studies and freshman seminar. Our goal is to educate middle school students and give them the skills necessary to make our school a safe space and a place of equality. This activity will also foster a bridge between high school students and middle school students, as well as instill a sense of community responsibility � they are not just responsible for establishing social justice for themselves, but for future generations of students. Students will be positive role models for incoming students.
Desired Learning Outcomes: Students will develop agency and become empowered to educate middle school students about social justice. Students will take ownership over their educational outcomes by designing the parameters of their success (goals must be specific and measurable). Students will understand how to create a lesson plan through backwards design, establishing desired learning outcomes, and establishing assessment questions in the form of an exit slip.
Assessments: Students will create a lesson plan using backwards design that is aligned to middle school social studies standards. Students will create an exit slip to check for understanding in order to determine the success of their lesson. Students will teach the lesson to their class to practice, and gain feedback from exit slips and to make adjustments to their lesson before they present at the middle school. After the lesson, students will individually write a 2,000-word reflection about their experience planning, teaching and analyzing the exit slips, connecting their lesson and their rational for their implementation to key concepts learned throughout the year in ethnic studies.

Course Content
Unit One: Introduction to Ethnic Studies
Unit Description: A critical analysis of systems of oppression and privilege and how they impact and shape resistance, consciousness, and identity. Students will learn about what an ethnic studies program is comprised of and will analyze how their participation in the course has the potential to positively impact their intellectual development, school culture, and community pride. Students will also look into their own educational backgrounds and reflect on how public institutions have helped to shape their own identity. Students' critical thinking skills will be developed through an emphasis on viewing the formation of identity through various lens and focusing on intersectionality. Students will use foundational concepts from this unit, key terms/vocabulary, and theoretical frameworks to analyze, evaluate, and respond to each of the course's unit.

Overview
This course presents an interdisciplinary study of traditionally marginalized populations in the United States - specifically African American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native American - through a social justice pedagogy and perspective. In Introduction to Ethnic Studies, students will investigate, analyze, and evaluate how constructs of race, class, gender, and sexuality intersect with notions of power and privilege to impact the African American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native American communities struggle towards selfdetermination and social justice in the United States. Traditionally, the experiences and contributions of African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os-Latinas/os, and Native Americans within the American historical narrative has been noticeably absent, thus requiring the need for students to engage in an academically rigorous and more inclusive historical and contemporaneous analysis of these respective communities to more accurately reflect their contributions and experiences as central, and not marginal, to the American historical narrative.

Course Content
Unit 1 - Building a Classroom Community
Students will build a community of trust and accountability within the classroom. This atmosphere is required as students explore their own identities and appreciate the identities of
131

others. Through numerous texts, including excerpts from Freedom Writers, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, I Am Joaquin, The Joy Luck Club, Lakota Woman, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Juliet Takes a Breath, students will analyze the concepts of responsibility, respect, empathy, honesty, loyalty, work-ethic, study habits, character building, belief, self-Improvement, self-reflection, mindfulness, problem solving, resiliency, and social justice. The exposure to various narratives, points of view, and perspectives will develop the students' understandings of themselves and their classmates. Students will gain a strong sense of self. Students will build bridges and develop a strong communal classroom culture that enables critical discussions to take place that push them academically. Students will develop better oral and speaking skills by drawing from the concepts addressed to engage in dialogue, activities, experiences and presentations such as restorative community-building circles. Students will demonstrate the creation of a sustainable collective community classroom culture through poetry, reflective writing, artistic expressions, and oral presentations. The culminating project will be a written personal narrative and empathy walk wherein students will share their stories and be assigned a sibling in the class to create a collective narrative of common struggle.
Unit 2 � Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
Students will be introduced to and demonstrate understanding of Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs." Starting with Maslow's 1943 article, "The Theory of Human Motivation," students will address Maslow's the following topics: physiological needs, safety and security needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs. Further exploration into the "Hierarchy of Needs" will include delving into trauma-informed care and stress-related issues as described by the scholarly work of Duncan-Andrade (2008) and Burke Harris (2014). Students will understand that every person is capable of and desires to have their needs met so that they can reach the pinnacle level of self-actualization--which is required for engaged students, actively engaged in their own learning. The culminating project will require students to use Maslow's Pyramid of Needs as a framework to read several case studies in order to identify and evaluate the root cause of the issues that plague all members of our society. They will participate in numerous Socratic Seminars to develop their own analysis and positions in order to write an argumentative editorial that will be submitted for public distribution.
Unit 3 � Elements of our Identity
The topics that students will address through the "Elements of Identity" unit are as follows: an analysis of scholarly literature on the origins, historical, and contemporary meanings of identities/names of African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os-Latinas/os, and Native Americans that have been assigned/forced upon them by dominant society (external forces) as well as the identities/names that these respective communities have self-determined and embraced (internal forces). Students will investigate, analyze, and evaluate the scholarly literature (including titles included in Unit 1) that describes processes of identity formation as a fluid and not static process amongst these identified populations, whom all have a diversity of identities. Students will investigate, analyze, and evaluate how the concepts/constructs of race, class, gender, im(migrant) status, language, and sexuality impact identity formation of African
132

American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native American through an analysis and evaluation of scholarly literature. Students will compare and contrast how the social and historical processes of assimilation and acculturation have impacted African American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native Americans identity formation.
Drawing upon the scholarly literature to include African American, Asian American, Chicana/oLatina/o, and Native American history, literature and poetry, students will write an informative essay that identifies the historical origins and contemporary meanings of the identities/names of the aforesaid populations. Additionally, students will affirm their chosen ethnic/cultural identity or identities drawing from the scholarly literature, history, literature, and poetry from African American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native American works � as well as drawing from their lived experiences. Through this informative essay, students will have engaged in the following: utilizing supporting evidence taken from the research, history, literature, and poetry in their writing to affirm a given position; critical analysis of research, history, literature, and poetry accompanied with a critical self-reflection to synthesize and/or distinguish it from their lived experiences; and develop a critical consciousness on the significance of naming themselves and their worlds which constitute processes of selfdetermination and self-actualization.
Unit 4 � Against Our Identities: Resistance, Survival, and/or Accommodation
The concepts of colonization, hegemony, forms of oppression (i.e., racism, classism, sexism, hetero-sexism, homophobia), prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination will be identified, analyzed, and evaluated in historical and literary text and also through media relative to the experiences of and impact on African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os-Latinas/os, and Native Americans within the United States. Specifically using Zinn's A Peoples' History of the United States and Steele's Whistling Vivaldi: How Stereotypes Affect Us and What We Can Do, students will explore the engaging topics of stereotype threat and resilience. Additionally, an identification, analysis and evaluation of historical and literary text and media on how African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os-Latinas/os, and Native Americans have worked to resist, survive, and at times accommodate to colonization and oppression within the context of American history. Furthermore, students will critically examine models of resistance to colonization and oppression of African American, Asian American, Chicana/o-Latina/o, and Native American communities within historical and contemporary contexts and determine the various resistance models' applicability to themselves, their respective communities, as well as inter-group collaborations between these aforesaid communities.
The culminating assessment for this unit will be a performative piece which will demonstrate student mastery of the concepts/constructs of colonization, hegemony, forms of oppression (i.e., racism, classism, sexism, hetero-sexism, homophobia), prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination. The performance piece can take the form of a debate, teatro (skit), poetry/spoken word, music/song, and/or dance. In addition to a formal teacher assessment, the students will also assess their peers on their performance piece.

The project will include introduction to several aspects of empirical cultural research, including identifying a subject for study, collecting data, coding and analyzing data, as well as writing and presenting research findings.
Unit 6 � Social Movements and Historical Figures
Students will examine the historical contributions and significance of social movements and historical figures. Using the textbook (Zinn's A People's History of the United States) and other primary and secondary sources, students will critically analyze global independence movements and revolutions, abolition of enslavement; rights movement (Asian, African American/Black, Chicano/a, indigenous, Latino, Pacific Islander, LGBTQ+, Muslims, women and all marginalized peoples). By shedding light on often untold histories, students will gain self-awareness, selfempowerment, in order to become critical agents for change and active participants in their democracies.
The culminating project for this unit is to author a children's book that illustrates and tells a story of a historic figure/movement and the quest for human rights and justice. Students will review the elements of storytelling and book-making including plot, conflict identification and resolution. Students will be expected to share their books during an arranged visit to a neighboring elementary school or youth program.
Unit 7 � Contemporary Issues and Transformative Change
Using excerpts from Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed, students will study and identify contemporary issues of oppression or threats to identity in order to become advocates for their community. Some of possible topics students will examine may include: racism, LGBTQ rights, immigration rights, access to quality health care, income inequality, War on Drugs, school-toprison-pipeline, poverty, religious persecution, access to equitable public education, gangs and violence. In this cumulative unit, students will use previous learnings to develop their own empowerment plan to address their identified community concern.

In this course, students will be exposed to numerous African American writers from a variety of times and places. In looking at literature through the lens of the African American community, students will grapple with the cultural struggles and successes represented in the text, from past to present. At the same time, students will also analyze the style, influences, motivations and contributions each writer has made to literature as a form of communication and expression. Students will look closely at the connection between historical events and African American literature, as well as major themes and ideals that are still relevant today, including equality, freedom, race versus ethnicity, and many others.

Course Content
In all units presented below, students will study the literature in conjunction with relevant historical content. The knowledge learned from past and current history classes will aid students in deepening their knowledge of the connections made in this course, thus including an element of interdisciplinary learning. Additionally, each unit contains elements of reading, writing, listening, speaking and language, however, the standards noted below represent the focal point of the unit. Most selections come from the primary textbook, those marked with an asterisk (*) indicate that it is part of a supplementary text.
Unit 1: African American Vernacular
Beginning with this mini-unit, students look closely at the vernacular history of African Americans. Focusing on inspiration, message and style, students will use/come back to this knowledge to see how written literature has taken from this tradition. Students will read and listen to oral literature, read and analyze information texts about vernacular, and will create an oral text to depict major issues in current times.
Sample selections: African American folktales (i.e., What the Rabbit Learned), Spirituals (i.e., Go Down Moses), Blues (i.e., Backwater Blues by Bessie Smith)
Correlated CCSS: Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Information Text 1-7, Speaking and Listening 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: In order to introduce students to the inspiration and message of African American spirituals, students begin by recording what they remember about slavery (in mini groups) on large pieces of paper. After briefly reviewing the events of slavery, a spiritual is given
136

to students in written form and is either sung or played (via audio). Students are asked to annotate with purpose, using a guiding question regarding the purpose of the spiritual. Finally, students are led through a class discussion in which we orally analyze the spiritual line by line; at the 50% mark, students are released to analyze the rest.
Unit 2: Slavery and Freedom (1746-1865)
Building on the established knowledge of slavery in America, students read and analyze literature that is founded and inspired by the lives of slaves and their subsequent fight for, and attainment of freedom. At this point, students will analyze literature for various themes and will establish a solid understanding of the distinction between race and ethnicity and how that will shape not only the experience of African Americans, but the literature as well. Focusing on narrative from this time period, students will write an analysis that looks closely at the characteristics of a slave/freedom narrative.
Sample readings/selections: Sojourner Truth: Ar'n't I a Woman?, Harriet Jacobs: Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Frederick Douglass: Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass (selections)
Correlated CCSS: Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Informational Text 1-7, Writing 1-10, Language 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: One characteristic of slave narratives is centered on the way the narrative begins, in order to introduce this element, students are given the first couple of paragraphs of 3 slave narratives. Students are asked annotate all three, highlighting any similarities found. Students are then asked to share their findings with their mini groups. Sending two representatives for each group, students are asked to record (on the board), things noticed about how the narrative began and about descriptions/recollections of parents. After a class discussion on the results, students are given brief information about two common characteristics (declaration of her/his status as a slave and description of parentage). Finally, with the new information in mind, students are asked to add to their annotations of the narrative.
Unit 3: Reconstruction and the Black Renaissance (1865-1919)
During this unit, students will look at the change that reconstruction brought for the African American community, and the rise of autobiographies during this period. Using skills to analyze non-fiction texts, students will look at the knowledge gained in the first two units and use inference, comparison and analysis to determine how literature of the reconstruction and Black Renaissance period fit with vernacular and the narratives of slavery and freedom. Building from the details of a slave/freedom narrative, students will analyze the shift to the autobiography, the similarities to previous narratives, and the message(s) contained within the text.
Sample Readings/Selections: Booker T. Washington: Up From Slavery, E.B. Du Bois: The Souls of Black Folk, Anna Julia Cooper, Alice Moore Dunbar Nelson
137

Correlated CCSS: Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Informational Text 1-7, Writing 1-10, Language 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: After recalling knowledge of the reconstruction period, students work to analyze Booker T. Washington's text, Up From Slavery. Students begin by free writing about what life must have been like for a slave and what their emotions would have been towards themselves, their masters and the plight they were face with. After sharing those reflections with peers, students read an excerpt from Washington's text. Guided with the question: based on what we have read and seen, does this accurately reflect the life and emotions of slaves? Explain. Students discuss both sides of this question, going back to evidence within the text that supports their opinions. After the discussion, students are given information about common criticisms of Washington's text, and students are asked to discuss and brainstorm the following in groups: if we assume that Washington wrote this text as a strategy, what could his reasons be for doing so? Use the information we have discussed, notes on common criticisms, and the text itself to brainstorm reasons and provide support.
Unit 4: The Harlem Renaissance (1919-1940)
Focusing on the events of the Harlem Renaissance and the migration that occurred during this time, students will read texts to analyze inferences the texts holds, what those inferences say about the purpose of the text, its message, theme and connection of the events happening during that time. During this unit, students will complete a creative assignment that will allow them to explore different perspectives and place themselves within the world they are reading about.
Sample readings/selections: Zora Neale Hurston: Their Eyes Were Watching God*, Isabel Wilkerson: The Warmth of Other Suns*, Nella Larsen: Passing, Langston Hughes: AfroAmerican Fragment, Dear Lovely Death, Mulatto, Song for Billie Holiday
Correlated CCSS: Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Informational Text 1-7, Speaking and Listening 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: After learning about the migration that African Americans took during this period of time, students read Zora Neale Hurston's book, Their Eyes Were Watching God, analyzing for common elements of the great migration and other common events and cultural/artistic experiences of the Harlem Renaissance. After reading about the first time Janie leaves, students are asked to reflect on the reasons why African Americans left their homes during the migration, and compare that to the reason Janie leaves. The reflection is done both in written form and through oral discussions, then student findings are discussed in class, and relevant information is added (by teacher) when necessary.
Unit 5: Realism, Naturalism, and Modernism (1940-1960)
138

Students will learn about realism, naturalism and modernism from the African American perspective. Looking at various texts, including poetry and drama, students will analyze and explore the connections between the ideals expressed, how it is present within the texts read, the historical events at the time and the strategies used by the writers analyzed.
Sample readings/selections: Toni Morrison: The Bluest Eye*, Gwendolyn Brooks (Poetry), James Baldwin (i.e., Everybody's Protest Novel, Princes and Powers), Richard Wright (i.e., The Ethics of Living Jim Crow, an Autobiographical Sketch)
Correlated CCSS: Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Informational Text 1-7, Language 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: In poetry, word choice is very important, especially when trying to communicate experiences from the perspective of a culture. Here, students analyze poetry through the usage of pragmatics, purpose and inference. Students are given a list of common words and are asked to define them, then students are given a list of sentences and are asked to define those same words within the context of the sentence. After discussing the idea of pragmatics and what role context plays in word meaning, the class reads through a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks. Students analyze the poem for complex words, their various meanings, and how those words can be used (and changed) to infer the poem's message.
Unit 6: Black Arts and the Contemporary Period (1960-Present)
The final unit of the year will have students look at African American writers from the sixties to the present. Students will look at well-known writers as well as the written text of musical lyrics to determine how literature has changed from the vernacular texts and slave narratives to the works we see today. The focus is to gain a holistic perspective of the themes, messages and tactics used by writers to communicate. In addition to communication, students will determine the many purposes of writing today, and compare that with the purpose of writing in the past.
Final Assessment
The final assessment for this unit (and of the year) will have students look at their own family and/or nationality and trace the history. The aim is to both share experiences from different perspectives, but also to show how other cultures/backgrounds are similar to the African American perspectives that we experienced throughout the year. In order for students to complete this unit, they will be required to demonstrate mastery of skills embedded in the following anchor standards:
Reading:
Key Ideas and Details 1-3, Craft and Structure 4, Integration of Knowledge and Ideas 7 & 9, Range of Reading 10
139

Writing: Text Types and Purposes 2 & 3, Production and Distribution of Writing 4-6, Research to Build and Present Knowledge 7-9
In addition to the anchor standards above, students will orally present their findings in front of an audience. *Includes a Final Project: Students use reading, writing, speaking and listening skills to complete a project:
Oral History Project: Students will construct a research paper and presentation from information read in nonfiction texts, and collected from interviews with family members, including the oldest member(s) of their family or extended family, etc. Students will also draw connections between their lives and the lives of any characters and/or themes that covered in our primary and/or supplemental literature. The purpose is to give students the opportunity to research the history of other cultures and backgrounds by exploring, learning and informing (i.e., their classmates, families, etc.). The project has different options as to ensure that students with various backgrounds can still complete the project, such as researching:
Personal ethnicity/heritage Example: Research your personal ethnicity/heritage. What connections can you make between your ethnicity and African Americans? If you are researching African American heritage, integrate any experiences you have been exposed to that would relate to the information covered in class.
Family history Example: What is your family history? Interview family members and review any documents you have access to. Begin as far back as possible, thinking about where your family comes from in terms of geographical location as well as your nationality. Also, try to make connections between your own family history and some of the events and themes covered in class.
Race in America Example: Thinking about the difference between race and ethnicity, research the development of race in America and how that has influenced/shaped American culture. Finally, discuss the specific influence race has on African Americans as well as your own ethnicity.
History of a certain race/nationality/minority during a specific time period Example: Research the history of Japanese individuals during the 1900s. Are there any connections to the history of African Americans during that time? Think about both historical events and hardships/achievements that both groups experienced.
Personal Identity Example: Think about your own identity and the `markers' that make you who you are; these markers, or identities often are beyond the scope of race and ethnicity. Your task is to research the history of one particular identity that you hold/identify with.
This project will be presented using a multimedia platform such as PowerPoint, Google Presentation, Prezi, etc.

Correlated CCSS: (some aspects from all CCSS categories - cumulative unit/project) Reading Literature 1-7, Reading Information Text 1-7, Writing 1-10, Language 1-6, Speaking & Listening 1-6
Sample Lesson/Activity: In order to gain a holistic perspective of African American literature and how it has developed, students need to recognize where the origins of this literature can be found in contemporary texts. Students are presented with the question: where do we see evidence of African American vernacular, slave and freedom narratives in contemporary texts? Looking at the autobiography of Malcolm X, students begin by analyzing the beginning of the text to determine similarities to originating texts. Students are asked to answer the question using evidence in order to demonstrate their ability to recognize elements initially studied.

Teachers will employ a scaffolded gradual release method for teaching skills and material. Students will go over material as a class through instructor guided learning and activities. Students will then practice the skill through the practice in pairs or small groups. Finally, the students will apply or practice the skill independently. This practice is designed to ensure that each student attains mastery within the construct of the gradual release scaffolding. In addition, students will go through a three-part learning process for each of the skills outlined in the Common Core/California Standards. First students will be taught the definition of the specific skill through examples, direct instruction, and discovery learning. Second, students will learn to recognize the skill when it is applied by various authors in fiction and non-fiction texts. Finally, students will apply the skill in their own writing and/or oral presentation. All lessons will build on prior knowledge and will be directed at completing a final project for assessment.

Overview
In this one-semester class, students engage in studying, writing, and performing different forms of oral expression from the African diaspora and African American speakers including spoken word, narratives and speeches, as well as learning how to interpret the written word. Students examine significant oral messages in African American history from Frederick Douglass to Barack Obama. They look at how individuals can convey beliefs and transmit values, including cultural values and traditions specifically from the African American experience and the Black church, to different audiences in different ways. Students will gain practical experience speaking aloud, performing spoken word and speeches to real audiences as well as an appreciation of the role that oral expression has played in the African American experience. Modeled after Western High School's "Oral Expression & Interpretation Performance," the focus in this course is on the Black American experience. Students will gain knowledge about the rich heritage of Black American oral expressions. Students will not only become proficient at speaking in a variety of social settings, both formal and informal, but they will become confident in their message and have a variety of skills to express their message. This will result in students building self-confidence and skills in expressing their message. Students will build a substantive voice for expressing mood, feeling, and opinion. Students will collaborate to effectively combine ideas and convey coherent messages as a group. Students will experience writing and speaking for self-healing, self-empowerment, community building and for the preservation and transmission of African American cultural traditions. Students will see themselves as poets, speakers, scholars, and teachers and experience the power of speech for bringing about positive change.
Common Core State Standards include: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY SL.11-12.1 (Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners on grades 1112 topics, texts, and issues, building on others' ideas and expressing their own clearly and persuasively), CCSS.ELA-LITERACY SL.11-12.2 (Integrate multiple sources of information presented in diverse formats and media in order to make informed decisions and solve problems, evaluating the credibility and accuracy of each source and noting any discrepancies among the data), CCSS.ELA-LITERACY SL.11-12.3 (Evaluate a speaker's point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric, assessing the stance, premises, links among ideas, word choice, points of emphasis and tone used), CCSS.ELA-LITERACY SL.11-12.4 (Present information, findings, and supporting evidence, conveying a clear and distinct perspective, such that listeners can follow the line of reasoning; alternative or opposing perspectives are addressed, and the organization, development, substance, and style are appropriate to purpose, audience, and a range of formal and informal tasks), CCSS.ELALITERACY SL.11-12.5 (Make strategic use of digital media in presentations to enhance understanding of findings, reasoning, and evidence and to add interest), and CCSS.ELALITERACY SL.11-12.6 (Adapt speech to a variety of contexts and tasks, demonstrating a command of formal English when indicated or appropriate).

Unit 5: Lectures & Lessons
Time Frame: 6 Weeks
Essential Question: What happens when everyday people are given a platform to speak? What makes "an idea worth spreading"? How does incorporating multi-media affect and enhance public speaking? What is effective speaking for the purpose of teaching a new idea or concept? What types of ideas, techniques, and speaking styles have resonated with African Americans throughout history?
Enduring Understanding: Anyone can become an expert on something and public speaking can be an effective tool to transmit or teach about that topic. Forums for public speaking spark growth, innovation, and change within communities, in particular the African American community. The use of multimedia with public speaking can greatly enhance the messages and complement 21st century developments and ideas.

Overview
In this literature course, we will take an exciting journey through Chican@ and African American literature. We will explore how this literature affects, documents, and creates Chican@ and African American histories, identities, politics, and the epistemologies/subjectivities of Chican@s and African Americans in America. Through our journey we will use novels, short stories, poetry, performance, screenplays, comedy, spoken word, theatre, essays, music, and film to examine the diversity of themes, issues, and genres within the "Black and Brown Community" and the legacy and development of a growing "Chican@ and African American Cultural Renaissance." We will also use critical performance pedagogy to engage particular problems in the literature and in the community. Through group/team work, community service, and interactive lectures and discussions we will delve into the analysis, accessibility, and application of Chican@ and African American literature. We will ask questions around the issues of--and intersections between--gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, language, religion, tradition, colonization, access, citizenship, migration, culture, ideology, epistemology, politics, and love. The main
167

questions that we try to tackle in this course are: How does Chican@ and African American literature represent, challenge, and/or change traditional notions of the Chican@ and African American experience? How can literature be used to activate the possibilities of decolonization, activism, and social justice?
This introductory course to Chicano and African American literature will examine a variety of literary genres - poetry, short fiction, essays, historical documents, and novels - to explore the historical development of Chicano and African American social and literary identity. Units will be divided by time period, beginning with the sixteenth century and concluding with contemporary works. We will examine the historical, political, intellectual, and aesthetic motifs of each era. In each era, we will focus on how authors address important issues such as race, class, nationality, and appellation, and how authors represent the complexities of being caught between multiple cultures that may be defined by those concepts. In each unit of the course, students will read various genres of Chicano/African American Literature, respond to the text in various modalities, and synthesize their own understanding of each time period with the ideas presented in the texts to derive a new understanding of the individual and collective identities as they evolved over time and space. The course will also consider key literary concepts that shape and define Chicano/African American literary production. By the end of the class, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the literary and historical formation of Chicano/African American identity and the complex, even contradictory, experiences that characterize Chicano/African American culture.

Course Content
At the conclusion of every other unit, instructors will facilitate an instructional exercise, assignment, or activity that allows students to process the units' essential questions through speaking and listening skills. In each activity, students will be evaluated on their ability to synthesize ideas presented in different texts and present their positions on the essential questions, both by the instructor and by their peers.
Speech Writing/Public Speaking Essential Questions: How does the process of colonization impact the colonizer and the colonized? When political decision making does take place with unequal power, how does the decision-making impact the outcome of the annexation? How did annexation reflect the mindset of the people in the period of colonization? What is the role of the story-teller in the pan-African Diaspora? How do narratives act as cultural artifacts? In the context of the American Revolution what does it mean to be African in America? What is the
168

African identity? How is it defined, and by who? Description: In this unit, students will compose and deliver a short, speech on identity, how it's defined, and how story-telling can preserve it.

Units 3 and 4: Socratic Seminar Essential Questions: How does the literature from this time period reflect the tension between alienation, assimilation and acculturation? How do we see this playing out in modern culture? How and why does the vocalization of grievances empower the minority? How does the literature and the Chicano labor movement reflect the unique needs of the Chicano population? "How does it feel to be a problem?" What is the double consciousness of the Black person in America in the era of reconstruction? What historical and political constructs made this duality possible? What are the multiple identities that emerged within the race as a result of reconstruction? What was the impact on the collective identity of Blacks in American society? Description: In this unit, students will participate in fishbowl style Socratic Seminars, where they will discuss with and evaluate their peers on questions generated and insight provided on the topic of double consciousness and the collective identity of African Americans in this era.

Unit 5: Literature Circles Essential Questions: What does it mean to be Chicano? How has the inclusion into the main stream impact the development of the Chicano Culture? Who is the New Negro?

Instructional Strategies are modeled on a district literacy strategy known as "ATTACK" as well as the Reading and Writing Rhetorically model outlined in the CSU Expository Reading and Writing Course.  The ATTACK literacy strategy involves the following components:

�

Assign complex texts to teach content. For this course, the content is the historical

development of the Chicano social and literary identity. Teach key academic and domain

specific vocabulary.

�

Teach and model reading and close reading strategies. These central reading strategies

utilized in this course are those used in ERWC and noted below. Ask text-dependent questions

during reading, discussion and writing.

�

Create conversation using accountable talk with text-based answers. Each unit will

involve multiple structured discussions (both whole and small group) in which students will be

required to demonstrate comprehension of the text as well as analyze its significance and pose

174

questions that require cognitive challenge. Keep writing focused on evidence-based answers and multiple sources. Students will write in a variety of contexts and formats, but will be required to use text from multiple sources to support arguments and illustrate ideas. 
As described above, reading and writing instructional strategies are modeled after the Reading and Writing Rhetorically model outlined in the CSU Expository Reading and Writing Course. 
Reading Rhetorically: � All texts will be introduced by a sequence of research-based prereading and vocabulary strategies. -- Survey the text in reader: title, italics, bold, footnotes -- Create questions based upon the text -- Predict: for questions or something to the learning  � All texts will be analyzed using analytical strategies such as annotating, outlining/charting text structure, and questioning. -- Read and re-read -- Annotation and marginalia -- Say, Mean Matter -Double entry journals � All texts will be examined and discussed using relevant critical/analytical elements such as intended audience, possible author bias, and rhetorical effectiveness. -- Summarizing -- Quick cheat sheet summary to be used in conjunction with any notes in order to write the formative essay. -- Capture main idea -- Who/What/When/Where? -Time period/date of writing -- Themes -- Historical context -- Author's perspective on essential question(s) � Students will work individually, in pairs and small groups, and as a whole class on analytical tasks. � Students will present aspects of their critical reading and thinking orally as well as in writing. Connecting Reading to Writing: � Students will write summaries, rhetorical pr�cis, and responses to critical questions. � Students will compare their summaries/rhetorical pr�cis, outlines, and written responses in small groups in order to discuss the differences between general and specific ideas; main and subordinate points; and subjective versus objective summarizing techniques. � Students will engage in note-taking activities, such as composing one-sentence summaries of paragraphs/passages, charting a text's main points, and developing outlines for essays in response to writing prompts. � Students will complete compare/contrast and synthesis activities, increasing their capacity to make inferences and draw warranted conclusions such as creating comparison matrixes of readings, examining significant points within texts, and analyzing significant textual features within thematically related material. Writing: � Students will write 750- to 1,500-word analytical essays based on prompts that require establishing and developing a thesis/argument in response to the prompt and providing evidence to support that thesis by synthesizing and interpreting the ideas presented in texts. � Students will complete timed in-class writings based on prompts related to an author's assertion(s), theme(s), purpose(s), and/or a text's rhetorical features.
Writing Instruction Text: They Say/I Say: The Moves that Matter in Academic Writing: Description: During each writing workshop in each unit, students will read a chapter from They Say/I Say by Graff and Birkenstein as both a research tool for improving writing as well as a metacognitive tool for reflecting on their own writing practices. Students will use the They Say/I Say writing templates beginning with unit 1 of the course, but will focus in depth on various aspects of argumentative writing process at different points in the course:
In conjunction with Unit 1: Introduction: "Entering the Conversation" (1-16) Students will begin by reading as Graff and Birkenstein write, "If there is any one point that we hope you will take

from this book, it is the importance not only of expressing your ideas (`I say') but of presenting those ideas as a response to some other person or group (`they say')" (3) This perspective on writing will be the principle guiding their writing in response to Chicano literature throughout the course. The first unit of study in Chicano Literature will require students to familiarize themselves with this model. In subsequent units, students will focus on the individual "moves that matter in academic writing." 
In conjunction with Unit 2: "They Say" (pages 19-29) Students will focus on the first element of the "They Say/I Say" model and develop their skills of "starting what others are saying." 
In conjunction with Unit 3: "Her Point Is" (pages 30-41) Students will study the art of summarizing. 
In conjunction with Unit 4: "As He Himself Put it" (pages 42-52) Students will continue the work of developing their ability to include the perspectives of others in their writing by reviewing and practicing "the art of quoting."
In conjunction with Unit 5: "Yes/No/Okay, But" (pages 55-67) Once they have had ample practice in stating the opinions of others, they will study the three ways to respond to a person's perspective: agreement, disagreement, or qualification.
In conjunction with Unit 6 "Entering the Conversation": Essential Questions: What is the role of the story-teller in the pan-African Diaspora? How do narratives act as cultural artifacts? Description: Students will begin by reading as Graff and Birkenstein write, "If there is any one point that we hope you will take from this book, it is the importance not only of expressing your ideas (`I say') but of presenting those ideas as a response to some other person or group (`they say')" (3) This perspective on writing will be the principle guiding their writing throughout the course. In this first unit, students will familiarize themselves with this model by informally responding to salient quotations from text through dialectic journaling. Students will then formulate an argument in response to the essential question in 1 or 2 paragraphs utilizing the "They Say/I say" approach. In subsequent units, students will focus on the individual "moves that matter in academic writing."
In conjunction with Unit 7 "They Say: The Art of Summarizing": Essential Questions: In the context of the American Revolution what does it mean to be African in America? What is the African identity? How is it defined, and by who? Description: Students will compose a rhetorical pr�cis for at least one of the anchor texts, summarizing its primary argument, how that argument is developed.
In conjunction with Unit 8 "They Say: The Art of Quoting": Essential Questions: "How does it feel to be a problem?" What is the double consciousness of the Black person in America in the era of reconstruction? What historical and political constructs made this duality possible? Description: Throughout the unit, students will focus their writing on analyzing and elaborating on specific quotations from the reading. As an assessment, students will compose a literary
176

analysis of a fictional piece from the unit, and how it reflects the double consciousness outlined by DuBois.
In conjunction with Unit 9 "I Say: Three Ways to Respond": Essential Questions: What are the multiple identities that emerged within the race as a result of reconstruction? What was the impact on the collective identity of Blacks in American society? Description: In this unit, students will work on formulating arguments in response to a text. Using the unit's essential questions as a guide, students will identify an author's primary argument (or central theme for fiction) and compose an in-class essay supporting, refuting, or qualifying the author's stance.
In conjunction with Unit 10 "Analyze This: Writing in the Social Sciences": Essential Questions: Who is the New Negro? What is the obligation of their work to the race and culture? Description: Building on their skills from the previous unit, students will critically analyze the concept of the "New Negro" and compose a short research paper that incorporates at least 2 other sources, and presents a position on the essential question.
In conjunction with Unit 11 "I Say: Distinguishing What You Say from What They Say": Essential Questions: In what ways did African American literature offer a counter-narrative to Post WWII American culture? Description: In this unit, students will compose short literary analysis essays focusing specifically on including "voice markers" in their writing to better distinguish their ideas from those presented by authors or parts of text.
In conjunction with Unit 12: "Analyze This: Writing in the Social Sciences" Essential Questions: What is the function of African American Literature in the social and political advancement of the race? Description: Synthesizing their skills from the course, students will compose a final analysis paper that incorporates at least 3 sources, and presents a unique and informed position on the unit's essential question.

These writing assignments will require that students summarize the author's perspective on the texts in each unit and then offer an agreement, disagreement, or qualification of his argument. They will use the texts read within each unit to support, refute, or qualify the author's argument. These assignments mirror the requirements of the essays that are part of the California State University and University of California English proficiency entrance exams with the objective of preparing students for those exams. Timed in-class essays and major writing projects. Examples of specific assignment types include: persuasive essays letters to the editor argument analysis, reflective essays, textbased academic essays, and research projects.

Overview
This course is a comprehensive survey of the major political, economic, geographic, social, and cultural trends and events of the United States from pre-colonial times to the present. Though the course will have a general focus on the role of African Americans within that history, it is a comprehensive and detailed survey of all of American history that aligns with the content covered in Advanced Placement U.S. History. Students will be exposed to the accomplishments, history, and culture of African Americans within the American and global context with an emphasis on the 20th and 21st Century, but also including a detailed review of the 19th Century (and to a lesser extent the colonial period) as a foundation for the last 100 years.
The course content is built around a pair of college level textbooks and includes rigorous supplemental readings (both books and other primary and secondary sources) as well as extensive writing and research. In addition to covering the state and district requirements for U.S. History, the course is designed to provide enrolled students with an opportunity to explore personal identity and race, and to broaden their knowledge and understanding of the lives, culture, and contributions of African Americans in the United States. Although the course is designed to be cored with the African American Literature Course, it could operate as a standalone class.

Course Content
The Roots of the American Experience
The unit begins with an introduction to the sociological, anthropological and historical construct of race and how those ideas have developed over time. This includes an exploration of the role of race in American society today. The unit then transitions into the historical timeline with a study of major pre-colonial African civilizations, the early development of the slave trade and its impact on Africa and the development of the American colonies (with a focus on the British colonies in North America). This will include an analysis of the way that geography and climate in Mesoamerica impacted the development of the Spanish colonies and why the models of colonization used by the Spanish were not fully replicated in the British colonies, but, instead, unique patterns of colonization developed due to the economic, religious and ideological motives of the colonists. Within the British colonial context this will include a detailed study of the major similarities and differences in the economic, social, religious and political developments across the colonial regions. Particular attention will be paid to the development of a slave economy in the South due to its geography and climate being ideal for the production of tobacco on large plantations in contrast to the development of a mercantile and trade-based economy in the New England and Middle Colonies. In relation to those economic developments, students will study the way that differences in the people and their motives for the initial colonization of the regions resulted in disparate social and political organizations across the regions (such as the intense religiosity and social "equality" of the earlier New England Colonies in contrast to the generally less religious, but politically hierarchical, South).
Unit Assignment(s)
African Empires Research Project: Students will read the selections in the course textbook, From Slavery to Freedom, that are relevant to major African Empires to establish background knowledge. Subsequent to that, in small groups, they will then use the school library and our school's digital access to academic journals to focus their research on one major empire. They will produce a detailed, three or more page research report (with proper citation of a minimum of five sources) about their specific empire and an accompanying power point or poster to present to the class. Students will, thus, become experts on their specific empire and have a strong general understanding of the richness of pre-imperial African civilizations.
Two Views of Native Americans: Students will read and compare excerpts about Native American civilization from Charles and Mary Beard's New Basic History of the United States (1944) and Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States (1980). They will then analyze the factors that might have resulted in the quite different perspectives on pre-colonial Native Americans that are presented in the two texts. This will include an analysis of the sources (or lack thereof) referenced by the authors, the context in which the authors were writing and the political and economic ideologies held by the authors (specifically, the fact that
184

the Beards were writing as Progressive Historians before the Civil Rights Movement in a period of intense nationalism and emphasized the "civilizing" element of European colonization for a group of Native Americans in constant conflict over land and power, while Zinn, of the New Left, wrote in the post-Civil Rights period and, as a socialist, wanted to emphasize the harmonious and egalitarian nature of Native American life) and how that impacted their approach to their subject. Finally, students will identify which source they find more reliable, explain why, and provide a counter argument as to why the alternate source might be more reliable.
Comparison of Hakluyt and The American People: Students will read excerpts from Richard Hakluyt's 1584 treatise A Rationale for New World Colonization and compare his arguments to the queen with the analysis of the motives for colonization as presented by Gary Nash in The American People. In doing so, they will be required to identify and account for similarities and differences in the two pieces. This will include considering how Hakluyt, as a strong proponent of colonization has a different audience, motive and objective in his writing than does Nash in his textbook.
A New Nation
This unit focuses on the ideological origins of the American independence movement. This includes an analysis of the basic ideas about government, representation, the social contract and Natural Rights were popular in Colonial America as developed by thinkers such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Thomas Paine and the American Founding Fathers. This will include a study of the key events (including the Seven Years War, British Acts of Parliament, and the Boston "Massacre") that preceded the American Revolution and an analysis of how those events shaped the ideas of American colonists about the necessity of the consent of the governed, etc. Later, as the students explore the development of the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution they will revisit these ideas when considering the structure of and principles enshrined in those documents and how those are a direct response to the colonial experience under British rule. They will also explore the formalization of the "American hypocrisy" in key American documents such as the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, the role of American colonists and African Americans in the Revolutionary War, and the failure to apply the Natural Rights Doctrine to all Americans in the specific ways that slavery was and was not addressed in the Constitution. Finally, the unit will cover the changing legal status of African Americans in the Revolutionary War Period and the further entrenchment of chattel slavery in the American political and economic system as an element of the larger political and economic transformations that were taking place as a group of once colonists attempted to establish a nation that had the economic and political power to sustain itself.
Unit Assignment(s)
American Slavery, American Freedom Analysis: In small groups, students will read and analyze excerpts from Edmund Morgan's American Slavery, American Freedom and think critically about the economic connections between chattel slavery and the ability for the United States to develop as a society and a nation. They will then compare their understanding from Morgan with
185

the assertions made in From Slavery to Freedom, and The American People and analyze which author(s) present a more convincing argument. Students will demonstrate their understanding through a series of brief guiding questions and participation in a class discussion. This assignment will help students to understand how deeply entrenched chattel slavery was in the American economic and political system as well as the official and unofficial institutions that developed to defend slavery. It will also emphasize the importance of the specific geographic and environmental factors that made plantation agriculture flourish in the South and how that plantation agriculture bolstered the developing American economy and how plantation agriculture played a critical role in funding both the Revolutionary movement and the early years of the new American republic.
Determining The Point of No Return: Students will write a brief analysis that identifies at what point, if any, it was no longer possible for the British to compel the loyalty of their American colonists. In essence, using historical information and arguments, the students must identify if the American Revolution was or was not inevitable; they must also take into account whether the revolution was primarily motivated by economic, political or ideological concerns held by the colonists and their leaders. If their thesis indicates that it was, they must prove with evidence at what point it became so. If their thesis indicates that compromise was still possible and the Revolution was not inevitable they must prove with evidence why that is the case.
Contextual Comparative Analysis of the Declaration of Independence (1776), Prince Hall's Petition (1777) and the U.S. Constitution (1789): Students will read and analyze the Declaration of Independence with a specific focus on the principles of self-determination, the asserted correlation between economic freedom and political freedom, and the Natural Rights Doctrine; they will briefly summarize how those principles were outlined in the Declaration and then compare that to the text of Prince Hall's Petition (in which he basically outlines the same ideas and demands that they be applied to African Americans). In doing so, students will demonstrate a clear understanding of how the status of colonial leaders affected their perceptions of Natural Rights and how and why those perceptions contrasted with the perspective of African Americans at the time. They will then extrapolate on those ideas to consider the perspectives that might have been held by women, men without property and other marginalized groups. In doing so they will refer back to the earlier review of principles of self-governance as asserted by colonial leadership and what that might mean for American society writ large. As the students progress through future units they will continue to consider those inequities as all of those groups continued to demand and fight for the equality outlined in the Declaration. Finally, students will analyze the sections of the U.S. Constitution that relate to slavery and, in a written analysis, assess to what extent the principles of the Declaration of Independence and Prince Hall's Petition were codified in the Constitution by selecting and analyzing specific quotes from each document. In completing this exercise the students will become well versed in the Natural Rights Doctrine, the American hypocrisy of slavery in a nation built on the principle of freedom and the Constitutional protections for slavery that will be consequential in the next 70 years of history, the fight for universal white male suffrage that was generally completed (with some exceptions) by the 1830s and the fight for women's suffrage that lasted until the 19th
186

Amendment in 1920. This comparative analytical work is also preparatory for a major essay to be completed in the next unit.
The Antebellum
This is unit is composed of two major elements that are intermixed throughout: 1) a detailed study of slavery in the United States (though it also touches on the developing free black populations in the north and south) and 2) an exploration of the developing sectional divide (political, economic and social) in the nation over slavery.
The study of slavery as a social and political institution covers the full geographic range of the country (not just the South), explores the experiences of both rural and urban slaves, and looks critically at the abolition movement (including the racial and gender divides within that movement). Particular attention is also paid to efforts that were made to justify slavery in the face of the abolition movement and the methods by which slave owners attempted to exert control over slaves. The sub-section of the unit concludes with a study of the connections between slavery, Jim Crow and the modern day. This section is contextualized within the larger story of U.S. history through a study of the methods by which the U.S. expanded westward during the first half of the 1800s, the drive to acquire new territory to ensure the continued economic and resource base growth of the growing nation, the political (mostly the American System) and technological changes (cotton gin, steam boat, turnpikes, railroads, etc.) that took place to support the exploitation and transportation of those resources and the increasing reliance on the cotton economy due to both domestic demand (because of early moves toward industrialization in the north) and the larger international marketplace (mainly in Britain).
The study of sectionalism begins at the time of the Constitution and ends with the Election of 1860. Therein the students will explore how the regional differences (geographic, economic, political and social) at the time of colonization laid the foundation for the sectional divide in the country that continued to grow prior to 1860. Students will also consider how regional identity shaped the way the people living in different sections (primarily north and south, but to an increasing extent west) viewed the nation, its government and their place within it. This includes a detailed review of the major attempts to create compromises and legislation to solve the increasingly divisive question of slavery (including, but not limited to the Missouri Compromise, the Comprise of 1850 and the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854) and how those efforts both delayed the Civil War but also intensified the sectional conflict that ultimately resulted in secession and the Civil War.
Unit Assignment(s)
Analyzing Slave Narratives: Students will read all of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and excerpts from the slave narratives written by Solomon Northup, Harriet Jacobs and Charles Ball. As they do so they will analyze the content and the rhetorical technique in the texts. Through three different short (one page minimum generally) written responses the students will demonstrate their understanding of the various methods of control employed by slave owners
187

(such as physical and mental punishment, the denial of education and the use of Christianity and "benevolence" in an attempt to create complacency). In specific relation to Douglass, they will also carefully make note of his use of rhetoric to advance his argument against slavery. This will both help them to fully understand the nuance of his argument and begin to prepare them for their more comprehensive essay that concludes the unit. Finally, they will have to consider the extent to which Douglass's narrative has value as a source from which to draw general understandings about the experience of slaves in the United States; in doing so they must address the exceptional nature of Douglass's life when compared to that of the vast majority of enslaved people in the United States but also identify the many ways in which his narrative, and the events therein, are reflective of the experiences of many enslaved people. They will do this, largely, by comparing his work with the excerpted slave narratives and the course textbooks. This will provide them with an understanding of the variety of experiences of enslaved people and also re-emphasize the importance of considering multiple sources as they attempt to ascertain the quality of the information within any given source and make reasoned arguments about historical events.
Culminating Analytical Essay Throughout the unit students will be reading excerpts from Carter Woodson's landmark study Mis-education of the Negro, portions of Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow and will view the documentary 13th. As the culminating assessment for the unit students will write a five page (or longer) analytical essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of the material through a comparison of these sources and other outside evidence (either from the course or through their own research); this paper must be typed in MLA format, carefully proofread, and include a properly formatted works cited with a minimum of five sources and in text citations.
The students can choose from one of these two prompts: In the mental and physical power struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, who had the upper hand? Make sure you discuss slavery, education and political structures. Mass racialized systems of control have been used in the United States in many ways, especially in the sphere of education. Compare the use of education (or the denial thereof) as a means of controlling African Americans during slavery, the 1930s and in the present.
The Civil War and Reconstruction
This unit focuses on the secession crisis that led to the immediate outbreak Civil War, the question of whether or not the war was inevitable, the role of African Americans within the context of the broader war, and the failures and successes of Reconstruction. The most important element of this is Reconstruction as it lays the foundation politically, socially and economically for the Jim Crow Era and much of the continued regional divisions that exist in the United States today. While this unit covers a period of major societal change, and the students will explore in detail the causes of that change, there are also continuities in economic, political, social and cultural identity that exist between the periods before, during and after the Civil War.
188

The first half of the unit covers secession, Lincoln's response and the general course of the war with specific attention to the debate over the changing purpose of the war. When contemplating secession students must consider the ways regional identity, different interpretations of what the United States was intended to be, the text and intent of the Constitution and the meaning of representation affected perspectives on secession and its legality. The study of the war is less one of battles and more one of the questions that arose about the changing purpose of a war that began, at least ostensibly, about maintaining national unity and the destruction of secession but without question transformed into one about the eradication of slavery. This will include a detailed look at the circumstances surrounding the Emancipation Proclamation and the short and long term outcomes of the order, including the ways in which it was an attempt to address the varying demands of the public in the north (including the divide between the working class and the upper class, Lincoln's tenuous political situation at various points in the conflict, the fight over abolition and emancipation, and the long unfulfilled expectations of equality from African Americans).
The second half of the unit deals with the political struggles and mixed outcomes of Reconstruction. Students will have to think about the complicated problems that resulted from secession and the Civil War including (but not limited to) how to address the restoration of citizenship rights to individuals and loyal governments in the South, whether or not it is appropriate to attempt to "rebuild" the South in a way that more replicates the North and to what extent (if at all) 4 million formerly enslaved people freed by the Civil War would be granted the rights of citizenship and how those rights would be protected when they were granted. This requires a thorough look at the internal political battles over Reconstruction between congress and the presidents responsible for carrying it out (mostly Andrew Johnson) as well as the ways that Southerners attempted to resist Reconstruction.
Unit Assignment(s)
Nullification Primary Source Analysis: Students will read and compare the arguments for nullification presented in the VA and KY Resolutions in response to the Alien and Sedition Acts, the Resolutions from the Hartford Convention, and John Calhoun's Exposition and Protest. They will complete a matrix that compares the arguments presented in favor of nullification and outline the extent to which each of the documents calls for nullification and/or interposition. They will then read South Carolina's Declaration of Secession and trace its philosophical origins to the previous three documents and the Declaration of Independence (which they have read previously) in a one-page written response. The students will, thus, learn and contemplate how South Carolina (and subsequent southern states) based their arguments for secession on many previous American ideas including the legitimacy of dissent, the belief that people should be represented by a government that reflects their interests and the right to change that government if it fails to represent them. This principle of political power originating with the people is central to the argument for secession and through reading these selections students will come to understand why many Southerners felt that a government dominated by the nonslave holding north (due to population size) was not truly representative but was, instead, the tyranny of the majority over the minority (the irony of which will be noted in relation to slavery).

Two Views on Secession: Students will compare and contrast South Carolina's Declaration of Secession with Lincoln's First Inaugural Address to develop a deeper understanding of the two key views on secession. They will then reflect, in a short written analysis, on how the different perspectives evidenced in in the documents are a direct result of the different geographical locations, economic and political circumstances and perspectives of the authors. As part of this activity the students will have to identify how the long established cultural and political norms of the north and south are reflected in these documents and how that has created, over time, the tension between these two broad groups, while also recognizing that within the two major sections of the nation there still exists a diversity of opinion about the issues that led to secession.
Was the Civil War Inevitable? In an approximately one-page written analysis that draws on material from previous units and this unit, students will answer the question "was the Civil War an inevitable result of events prior to the Election of 1860?" They must consider the full scope of societal changes and developments that had taken place in the years preceding the Civil War, what caused those changes and the increasing polarization of the nation, and whether or not those changes were an unalterable result of the earliest stages of national development or if that path was alterable in some way. In order to do this effectively they must first address the question "what caused the war?" At a general level, this is a question of politics, economics and society, but more specifically from their studies they have a number of more narrow options from which to choose including, but not limited to, the establishment of a nation based on the principles of freedom yet built upon the enslavement and subjugation of a race of people, the transformational rise of the Republican Party, the political rhetoric and election of Abraham Lincoln, secession, sectionalism and a perception of the failure of representation, etc. After completing their writing students will participate in a Socratic discussion about their various interpretations of the historical events so that they can explore the many different causal explanations for the outbreak of the war.
Contextualization and Analysis of the Emancipation Proclamation: In small groups students will read and analyze Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. As they do, they will answer a series of questions that will help them see both the limitations of the proclamation and the reasons Lincoln saw those limitations as necessary. They will then connect the proclamation back to Lincoln's previous stances on slavery and the possibility of true equality and citizenship for African Americans beginning with the Lincoln-Douglass Debates; this will be based on a number of short selections from Lincoln's speeches as well as selected readings from The American People, From Slavery to Freedom and The American Political Tradition by Richard Hofstadter (who, in particular, addresses the complexity of Lincoln as a figure and the difficulty in ascertaining what he truly believed). They will then write a brief response assessing the legitimacy of Lincoln's reputation as the "Great Emancipator" in which they will provide specific evidence from a minimum of three sources. In completing this exercise they must also address the reliability and quality of the information in the sources that they have accessed by identifying why they have chosen certain sources to support their argument and specifically addressing the potential problems with relying solely on the public statements of a politician with an agenda (in this case, Lincoln) when attempting to understand a particular moment in history. This will
190

clearly demonstrate their understanding of the complex nature of the political climate in the Civil War period and of Lincoln as a man and as a president.
Planning Reconstruction Group Activity: In groups of three, students will be presented with seven specific issues that existed in the run-up to and early stages of Lincoln's War Time Reconstruction (such as "What responsibility, if any, does the U.S. government have to physically repair and rebuild the South after the devastation of the war?"). For each question the students must come up with their response and a reasonable counterargument to their response as if they were debating the issue during the period. This will help them to think more critically about the complex nature of Reconstruction as they take into account the complex climate of the period. At the same time, they will learn about the major issues that developed during Reconstruction. To demonstrate their understanding the student groups will produce written responses to each question and participate in a class debate.
The Gilded Age and the Progressive Era
This unit is an intense study of the development of America as an industrial superpower and the impacts of that transition on the American people. This begins with a study of the changing needs for resources during the transition toward industry, how the U.S. met the need for those resources by expanding its exploitation of the natural environment (particularly for fossil fuels, but also for building materials, land to accommodate a rising population, and changes in the agricultural landscape to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population). From there, students will explore how the nature of work changed significantly to meet the demand for goods and how transportation networks (mostly nation-wide rail systems) expanded to make the effective and efficient distribution of those goods possible. The explosive increase in immigration and formation of white ethnic neighborhoods, the questions that created about the meaning of citizenship as a building block for American society and the expansion of ethno-religious nativism in response to the changing face of America will also be addressed in detail. Students will compare and contrast those largely northern developments with the development of the "New South" in the Jim Crow Era and the re-drawing of the Color Line and the impact of increasing migration of white Americans into the Great Plains on Native American populations and the environment. Finally, students will analyze the causes of, and efforts at, Progressive Reform to resolve the tensions and conflicts created by the economic, political, social and cultural changes taking place in America between the Civil War and WWI. All of this will give the students a complete picture of the many explanations for the causes of the massive transformation of the economic, political and social landscape of the country that took place in the late 1800s.
Unit Assignment(s)
Close Reading of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments: In small groups students will critically analyze the text of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments. They will specifically focus on the letter of the law and the spirit of the law and the failures of the federal government to enforce the amendments in the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era. This activity will culminate with a
191

written analysis of the way that the letter of the 14th and 15th Amendments could be used to undermine the spirit in which they were passed; students will support their argument with specific evidence from the time period.
Essay Comparing Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois and Marcus Garvey: Students will read and analyze significant selections from Up from Slavery, The Atlanta Compromise, The Souls of Black Folk, and Selected Writings and Speeches of Marcus Garvey. In doing so they will deeply understand the different approaches to civil rights reform that lay the foundation for later movements and activism. To demonstrate that understanding students will produce a two page minimum argumentative essay (with citations) in favor of one of the approaches presented by one of the three men; they must also identify why the other approaches are less desirable. In doing so they will demonstrate an understanding of the varied perspectives on life in the late 1800s and, in particular, civil rights issues, for African Americans based on their background and origins. They will also explore the unifying elements of the African American experience in the United States in this time period and how the similarities of that experience across geographic, political and economic realms resulted in similar interactions with the larger American population.
Analyzing Immigration Data: In small groups, students will read three selections from different sources related to the rise of nativism in the late 1800s: excerpts from P.S. Dorney's 1871 description of anti-Chinese violence in California, a selection from The American People by Nash and selections from Howard Zinn's A People's History of American Empire that allude to, but do not explicitly discuss, issues of nativism. Each source presents a different interpretation for the causes of nativism: one identifies racism as the primary catalyst for nativism, one identifies cultural and religious factors as the primary cause of nativism, and indicates nativism was primarily a response to changing economic conditions. After reading the three sources, each group will analyze immigration data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau between 1820 and 1940 and excerpts from the "Gentleman's Agreement" to assess the accuracy of the information presented in the three original sources and produce a written argument in favor of one being the "most accurate." A class discussion will follow in which students will continue to deliberate about the quality of each source.
Exploring the Progressives: Students will read and respond to selections from Upton Sinclair's The Jungle to help develop their understanding of the causes and consequences of the transformation from a largely agrarian society to an industrial society reliant on large scale, industrial agriculture to feed a growing population. They will then analyze Teddy Roosevelt's efforts to support Progressive reform as a response to the significant changes that had taken place in the U.S. between the 1870s and early 1900s. Finally, they will have to attempt to determine to what extent the success of Progressive reforms was contingent upon the leadership of national political figures like TR or if the work of non-politicians, muckrakers, etc. such as Ida Tarbell, Alice Paul, Walter Rauschenbusch, John Muir, Jacob Riis, etc. would have been sufficient to effect national change; basically, this forces them to consider what ultimately caused society to changes its ideas about the role of government in the daily life of citizens and
192

the impact that had on the national culture as well as how those societal changes catalyzed changes to the traditional political practices and institutions of the nation.
The U.S. Becomes a World Power
This unit focus on the causes and consequences of the shift in American foreign policy from the end of the Civil War to the end of WWI. Prior to this period the U.S. was generally restrained to expanding continentally, but with the growth of the U.S. into an industrial power that changed and the nation transformed as it sought to expand its reach abroad. Students will trace the origins of the economic, political and cultural drive for expansion in the U.S. and explore how pre-existing ideas such as Manifest Destiny transformed as the nation developed the industrial and economic capacity to exert its influence abroad. Through the analysis of case studies (and building on content from sophomore year) that include the Indian Wars, Spanish-American War, the Philippine �American War, the Hawaiian Annexation, the establishment of "Big Stick" and "Dollar Diplomacy" policies in Latin America and the Caribbean and WWI, students will explore whether or not American imperialism was a foregone conclusion as the nation rose as an industrial power and yearned for new markets and resources to enrich the population (or some segment thereof), if the nation had betrayed its founding principle in the actions it carried out abroad and how accusations of such at the time brought into question the normative national identity of a democratic society protecting people's rights, and how geography (particularly the need to guarantee access to China for trade) affected the imperial impulse. For the events preceding WWI, students will focus on analyzing the causes and consequences of American imperialism and the connections between race, economics, political power and imperialism. The section on WWI will largely contrast Wilson's "War for Democracy" with the status of women and ethnic minorities at home and explore how that conflict transformed American society by leading to the 19th Amendment granting women suffrage (much as with the 15th Amendment and the Civil War, the continued extension of the democratic ideals of self-government to another group of citizens), increased political activism by African Americans and the rise of socialist and communist ideologies that challenged the traditional laissez-faire identity of the nation (the roots of which were in the previous unit on the Gilded Age). In relation to the significant transformation of American society in WWI, students will also have to consider how the various domestic war time policies (Wilson's "war socialism," the Espionage and Sedition Acts, etc.) challenged and changed the way the country operated. Many of these transformation from the WWI period were foundational to the rapid shift in the American experience during the Roaring 20s. There will also be a review of the 14 Points and the Treaty of Versailles (which is covered extensively during sophomore year).
Unit Assignment(s)
Foreign Policy Analysis: Students will read and respond to guiding questions from Howard Zinn's graphic novel A People's History of American Empire. This will expose them to the complexity of American foreign policy decisions about the Spanish-American War and the Philippine-American War as well as provide detailed content on the specific experiences of African Americans during those wars. As students read and respond to questions they will be
193

expected to formulate an analysis of Zinn's biases and the manner in which he crafts his narrative to present a storyline that supports his personal worldview. Students will then compare his work with the writings of prominent American isolationists (Twain and Cleveland), imperial subjects (Emilio Aguinaldo from the Philippines and Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii) and prominent American expansionists (McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft and Dole) in preparation for a debate about American foreign policy. As they synthesize all of this material they will identify how the various interpretations of the causes of the shift to an expansionist foreign policy reflect continuities and changes in ideas about what America is, and is supposed to be, as a culture and society.
Foreign Policy Debate: Students will be broken into teams and will debate specific elements of American foreign policy prior to WWI. Students will be expected to use information they have learned in class as well as information that they have researched on their own in support of their argument. This will help them further develop research, writing and argumentation skills that we have been working on throughout the year and ensure that they have acquired, and can demonstrate, a deep understanding of the content from the unit. During their preparation they must evaluate the quality of the information in the various sources that they have compiled and select the most relevant and reliable information available. This means that they will need to look for instances in which a similar narrative has been presented across multiple sources to verify the reliability of that evidence. They will also have to compare and contrast different perspectives on the various events that they will be debating and account for why the author holds that particular perspective based on who they are, where they came from and the circumstances in which they found themselves at the time of their writing.
Multiple Perspectives on WWI: Students will read two essays written by W.E.B. DuBois in The Crisis and compare their purpose, point of view and tone. The first is generally supportive of African American men enlisting to fight in WWI while the other is a scathing critique of the treatment of returning African American soldiers. They will then compare DuBois's essays with highly nationalistic speeches and essays written by Calvin Coolidge, Warren G. Harding and A. Mitchell Palmer. In reading and comparing these documents students will demonstrate important analytical skills, the ability to use historical context in their analysis and also learn more about the varying perspectives in the U.S. about participation in WWI, and in particular how historical experience played a role in shaping those perspectives.
The Roaring 20s
This unit is an overview of the socio-political climate of the 1920s. It begins with a review of the Progressive Era, progresses through the generally tense period of the early 1920s as the KKK rose to prominence, prohibition went on the books, women began exploring their identities more publicly after the 19th Amendment and tension rose between traditional American Protestant Christian values and conservatism and the rising "modernism" of the period. Particular attention is paid to how and why the United States (and the rest of the world) was undergoing such dramatic changes in the wake of industrialization, imperialism and (most significantly) World War I and how those changes challenged and transformed cultural norms that had largely been
194

in place in the United States from the earliest days of its founding. From there, the students undertake a study of the Harlem Renaissance as a socio-political movement largely expressed through art and literature, but also through the rising political activism of the NAACP, National Urban League and various communist organizations.
Unit Assignment(s)
Multiple Perspectives on Prohibition: Students will view selections from the documentary film Prohibition and compare the assertions made in the film to those presented in two primary accounts of prohibition, one written by a visiting German (Felix von Luckner) and the other written by Frederick Lewis Allen (an historian and editor) in Chicago. Students will have to write an analysis accounting for the similarities and differences evidenced in the three sources.
Harlem Renaissance Research and Presentation Project: Student pairs will be assigned two key figures from the Harlem Renaissance. Using their textbooks (From Slavery to Freedom and The American People) as a starting point, and branching out into independent web and library research, student pairs will research their two people extensively. As they research they will constantly evaluate the quality of information in the sources that they uncover and only utilize those that can be corroborated in multiple instances, are reliable and of academic merit. Based on this research and source analysis, they will then produce a presentation for their classmates that explains their two figures, their specific role in the Harlem Renaissance and how their work and products fit more broadly into the Harlem Renaissance as a socio-political construct. This will demonstrate their specific expertise in their figures as well as an understanding of the Harlem Renaissance more broadly; their presentations will also provide reinforcement to their fellow classmates.
Literature and the Harlem Renaissance Essay: Students will read and analyze at least two of the following books: The Ways of White Folks, Passing, or Their Eyes Were Watching God. They will also read other selected poems and short works. Following that, they will write a fivepage minimum analytical essay focused on how the texts they read reflect the principles of the Harlem Renaissance, particularly as identified in Alain Locke's New Negro. They will, through this essay, demonstrate a deep understanding of the Harlem Renaissance as an expression of African American identity as it developed from slavery to the 1920s and as a model for African American self-help and advancement socially, politically and economically. They must specifically explain why the face of African American resistance to racism changed during the 1920s and how those efforts led to responses and reactions that caused changes in the general American culture (some positive, some negative) and to what extent those reflect preexisting cultural norms and interactions between African Americans and American society writ large.
The Great Depression and the New Deal
This unit focuses on the causes, consequences and responses to the Great Depression. Economics and market principles form the foundation of the causes section. This includes a detailed look at the economics of the 1920s and the "boom" that was certainly extant for almost
195

all Americans, but disproportionately benefited the upper and middle class. The section on consequences explores the urban and rural experiences of Americans during the Depression. Within the rural Depression specific attention is paid to the ecological disaster of the Dust Bowl region and how that was a result of a combination of the physical geography and climate and human actions as a result of the rapid increase in demand for agricultural products, and the production thereof, during the post-Civil War period largely as a result of the Homestead Act of 1862. Attention is also given to the "Okie" migration and a correlation is drawn between the Great Migration of the 19teens and 1920s. The most significant understanding that students must walk away with, however, is how the New Deal dramatically transformed the American political and economic system. The New Deal significantly increased federal power and reach; students will be expected to grapple with how the changes to the U.S. government as an institution and the practices it undertook (such as highly regulating the economy and providing direct aid to citizens) was a direct result of the historical developments of the preceding years and the societal changes that had taken place following the economic crash.
Unit Assignment(s)
Stock Market Simulation: Students will participate in a stock market simulation in which they buy and sell stocks (including on margin) over a period of simulated years and track their transactions. The market is rigged, of course, to simulate the boom of the 1920s and the decline that began in late 1928 and rapidly accelerated in mid-1929. At the conclusion of the simulation and following instruction about the economic causes of the Great Depression, the students will produce a written reflection in which they analyze their decision making during the simulation and the correlation between their experiences and the experiences of people in the 1930s. This will demonstrate their understanding of the causes of the Great Depression.
Black History Month Article Analysis: This is a one-page minimum typed personal reflection on Carter G. Woodson's establishment of Negro History Week (now Black History Month) and the appropriateness of it as a schema for focusing the American people on African American history. Students will be reading and reflecting on a scholarly article that has a fairly negative view of Black History Month. Though they will not necessarily be cognizant of it at the time, by thinking about (and writing about) whether or not Black History Month is a good idea the students will be dealing with many of the major issues we cover second semester. The controversy that surrounds Black History Month is quite relevant to inclusion vs. segregation, accommodation, self-help, Black Nationalism, etc. Students will be reminded of, and asked to refer back to, the article throughout the semester. The students will also be asked to incorporate what they learned while reading Woodson's The Mis-Education of the Negro into their analysis.
What Caused the New Deal? Students will begin this exercise by graphing economic data from the early 1920s through the late 1930s. This data will cover things such as bank failures, business closures, unemployment, wages, etc. By analyzing this economic material they will see the dramatic economic collapse that took place beginning in 1929. After doing so, they will then read several primary sources (Allen, Roosevelt, Wright and Rosskam) that address the social and psychological consequences of the Great Depression and the impact it had on
196

American society. Finally, they will view parts of the documentary The Great Depression that cover the political ideas and solutions presented by the left and the rights during the Depression. After considering all of these sources the students will produce a thesis responding to the prompt: "Was the New Deal primarily a result of economic, social or political pressure?" They will then list and briefly explain significant evidence from those sources that they would use in defense of their thesis and those which could be used to present a counter argument.
World War II
In 10th grade students participate in an in-depth study of WWII. This year, in 11th grade, we study in depth the American war-time domestic policy. This begins with pre-Pearl Harbor foreign policy decisions that FDR called "steps to maintain neutrality" such as the Four Freedoms Speech, the Neutrality Acts and Lend-Lease, the Selective Service Act, the Atlantic Charter and the economic sanctions and trade embargoes placed on Japan. The other major pre-war focus is on civil rights issues (including FDR's effort to address inequality in hiring through Executive Order 8802). After Pearl Harbor, the unit moves into the ways the US transitioned into a war time economy and a state of total war as well as the civil rights issues that arose out of that (including the role of women in the war effort, Executive Order 9066 and Korematsu v. U.S., general divisions among African Americans about serving and other issues of tension created by the Second Great Migration, the Zoot Suit Riots, anti-Semitism and the limited response to the Holocaust, etc.). Specific attention is paid to comparing and contrasting the different domestic experiences of various segments of the American population within the global context of a war to preserve democracy and fight totalitarian repression.
Unit Assignment(s)
Responding to the "Date Which Will Live in Infamy" Students will read FDR's "Date Which Will Live in Infamy" speech and write a short analysis that makes an argument about the accuracy of his assertions about the attack on Pearl Harbor. In this writing students must address American and Japanese foreign policy prior to the attack and consider whether or not the attack could be considered justifiable given those actions. In doing so, they must take into account the pressure the U.S. was attempting to exert over Japan and the explicit and implicit threat of Japanese imperial expansion in the Pacific.
African Americans in the War Annotated Bibliography: Students will do online research to identify seven academically reputable websites that provide information about the African American experience in WWII (either in military service or at home). They will then provide a citation for each website and summarize the relevant content. In that summary they will analyze the value of those websites for understanding the African American experience. By completing this assignment, students will learn a wide variety of information about the African American experience during the war. They will also demonstrate critical research, citation and synthesis skills as well as the ability to differentiate between reliable and unreliable primary and secondary sources.
197

The 1950s, 1960s and the Cold War
Much like WWII, this content is covered heavily in 10th grade. This year, in 11th grade, we are focusing on how the U.S. led the development of a post-WWII liberal economic and political order evidenced in agreements about free trade, the Marshall Plan, NATO, etc. as a way to counter the power of the Eastern Bloc and the USSR. They will specifically look at how those institutions are a reflection of pre-existing political and economic ideas and institutions in the United States but also a direct result of the devastation of two European wars in the first half of the 20th century and the fear of a third in the post-WWII period. Another element of the unit is the domestic transformation taking place as a result of the booming post-WWII American economy. This includes the transition toward a more heavily mechanized, white-collar economy and the increasingly integrated global economy that became central to the ability of the United States to maintain itself but also distribute resources both internally and externally to allies. The other major aspects of the Cold War covered focus on American covert operations abroad, domestic policy (such as McCarthyism as an effort to protect and maintain perceived American cultural norms and values) and the nuclear arms race. This unit also serves as a transition between WWII and the Civil Rights movement as many of the themes we cover become relevant to the Civil Rights Movement � particularly the connections between anti-communism and opposition to the Civil Rights Movement as well as the philosophical conflict of being a nation focused on spreading "democracy and freedom" abroad while (at least to some extent) ignoring failures to provide those things at home for all Americans.
Unit Assignment(s)
Policy Debate: Students will debate American intervention in various Cold War events; each pair of students will be assigned a different topic to debate (one will be pro-intervention and the other will be anti-intervention). The foundation of their debate will come from in class research done at the library, online and in the main textbooks for the course. They will have to include an annotated bibliography of their sources and assess the quality of the sources they are referencing in that bibliography. Building on their rhetorical abilities from earlier in the year, students must use historical evidence to persuade that class that American policy during the Cold War was either justifiable or not justifiable. Debate performance will be assessed on oratory skill and the legitimacy of their historical arguments. Other students in the class will be responsible for completing a chart that outlines the basic arguments presented by each side. This will help everyone review the various American interventions during the Cold War and develop a deep understanding of the conflicts over such decisions.
The Civil Rights Movement
This unit begins with a fairly comprehensive review of civil rights related events, figures and ideas that took place or existed before the late 1800s (all of which were covered earlier in the year). From there, the students begin an in-depth exploration of the Civil Rights Movement beginning with Plessy v. Ferguson and moving up until the mid-1970s. They will focus on the most transformative events, organizations and people while also exploring lesser known figures.
198

Of particular importance will be their work to develop an understanding of how the goals and objectives of the movement changed over time and what caused those changes - specifically, the transformation from a movement largely focused on changing the laws and Supreme Court decisions to one focused on meaningful economic, social and political equality once those legislative changes took place. This includes an analysis of the growing radicalism of the movement beginning in the mid-1960s and accelerating rapidly after the assassination of MLK in 1968. They will specifically look at the way the Civil Rights Movement transformed American politics, economics and society and ponder whether it would be more accurate to say that those transformations were an inevitable outcome of the continued expansion of democracy and rights to all Americans or a distinct result of the active work of thousands of people and could just as easily have not taken place. Finally, they will assess the successes and failures of the Movement in preparation for material covered in future units of study. While the unit is largely focused on the African American Civil Rights Movement, significant time will also be devoted to other movements (primarily Free Speech, Women, Gay Rights, Chicano/a, Asian American, Native Americans and people with Disabilities) and how those movements continued to further the expansion of rights to all Americans. This unit also revisits many of the questions raised earlier in the year about the political practices and ideologies established in the United States in relation to the right of all citizens to participate in their government, the general principle of Natural Rights, and the responsibilities of citizens within a democracy.
Unit Assignment(s)
The Autobiography of Malcolm X Analysis: Students will read The Autobiography of Malcolm X and will write three brief papers analyzing the text at major turning points in Malcolm's life. These assignments will be given following Malcolm's imprisonment, after he takes the Hajj and after completing the text (which includes his assassination in the Epilogue). The students are expected to write a minimum of two pages for each assignment, utilize at least three quotes directly from the text in each and provide supporting historical context and evidence. In doing so they will demonstrate an understanding of the depth and complexity of both Malcolm X and the Civil Rights Movement in which he rose to prominence. This will highlight their understanding of the causes of the changes in the methods and motives of the Civil Rights Movement over time and how those changes affected the general attitude of Americans in general toward Civil Rights while also engendering resistance to the Civil Rights Movement. The final written piece will also require and assessment of the reliability of the narrative presented in The Autobiography of Malcolm X, as the text has been criticized as essentially a mythologization of one man that fails to consider the many other elements of the Civil Rights Movement and often disregards the more negative aspects of his actions and ideas.
Civil Rights Movement Presentation: This assignment begins with a two- to three-page MLA format research report on an important moment, figure, etc. in the Civil Rights Movement. Using the skills developed earlier in the course (including assessing the reliability and quality of primary and secondary sources, reading and analyzing primary and secondary sources for an understanding of multiple perspectives on certain events and people, technical skills such as grammar and writing technique, providing proper citation, and writing clearly and coherently)
199

students (or pairs) will research a specific topic from the Civil Rights Movement. Students will be able to choose from around 40 potential topics including events like the founding of CORE, the March on Washington, the assassination of Medgar Evers, and Loving v. Virginia. Students will have to provide a thorough explanation of the event; that explanation must include any relevant historical background and the later impact of that event. The research paper will then be submitted for review by the teacher and any necessary changes will be identified; this revised paper will be used as the foundation for the student generated power point presentation to be given to the class.
Invisible Man Analytical Essay: Students will be reading Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man in English with support coming from history. The summative analytical essay will analyze Ellison's literary effort to allegorically analyze and comment on the historical experiences of African Americans from the end of Reconstruction to the end of WWII. Students will be required to incorporate a minimum of five additional sources beyond the text as part of their analysis; these sources must be carefully considered and analyzed for accuracy and relevance to the topic and the text to ensure that they have value. This assignment will demonstrate an understanding of the book, the complex historical allusions and references Ellison makes and their effective writing technique and integration and analysis of primary and secondary sources.
The Vietnam War
This unit is a comprehensive study of the Vietnam War (both abroad and at home). Within this unit the full effect of the tumultuous 1960s comes to its conclusion in the early 1970s with the Watergate Scandal, the resignation of Nixon, the end of the Vietnam War and the virtual collapse of the Civil Rights Movement. It builds extensively on the unit on the Cold War and also incorporates and expands upon many key elements from the unit on the Civil Rights Movement, especially the rising discontent and violence at home in the late 1960s. This marks another transformative moment for American society as the pre-Vietnam perceptions of the government and leaders were shattered during this period and replaced with an entrenched distrust that is still prevalent in American life today. Students will have to consider the political, cultural, social and economic conditions that catalyzed those watershed shifts in the American experience and question whether or not the violence and frustration that sparked those changes could have been resolved without such a dramatic transformation. For many Americans, these transformations effectively destroyed many of the extant building blocks of American society such as the traditional nuclear family, church and belief in the government and its agents. As a result, many Americans began to question whether or not the government could still be trusted to distribute political power to the citizens or if those citizens had an obligation to take the power from the government (by revolutionary force if necessary).
Unit Assignment(s)
Vietnam Era Song: Students will write a song that deals with the Vietnam War or Civil Rights Movement. Students will be given a specific stance for their song to take (either in favor of or opposed to Vietnam or Civil Rights) and will have to demonstrate an understanding of the
200

different perspectives on the Vietnam War or Civil Rights Movement through their lyrics. They will be allowed to modify a professional musician's song (though not one about Vietnam or Civil Rights) or write one of their own. In doing this students will demonstrate that they have solid general understanding of the time period and the ability to synthesize and explain specific content. The activity will also demonstrate their ability to compare and contrast different historical perspectives on Vietnam or the Civil Rights Movement.
The Rise of Radicalism: Students will write a one to two-page analysis of the legitimacy or illegitimacy of the increasing radicalism of both the Anti-war and Civil Rights Movements in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Students will have to show that they understand the causes of the change toward more radical ideas and movements by citing specific historical evidence from quality primary and secondary sources. They will then have to make an argument either for or against that radicalism as part of the traditional American political culture and value set based on content from other units in the course.
From D�tente to Today
This unit is a comprehensive review of foreign policy and general domestic trends from the end of the Vietnam War to the modern day. The foreign policy section focuses on the causes and effects (primarily economic and political) of the end of the Cold War, the increasing liberalization of the global economic system, immigration and the rise of new threats such as terrorism in the late 20th and early 21st century. Domestic policy centers on the rise of women in the work force, the rise of the modern environmental movement, and the increased centralization of urban poverty and subsequent questions about, and policy changes related to, social welfare programs (particularly during the Reagan and Clinton administrations) in an effort to more effectively meet increasing pressure for resources and services in areas of increasing poverty. Within that context, the significance of the election of Barack Obama as president and the backlash against that will be central to the study of the 21st century. This unit is the last and culminates with a number of reflective pieces for students to take part in both in the community and with each other.
Unit Assignment(s)
Discussing the Year: For this assignment students are charged with the task of interviewing two adults about 10 major contemporary domestic social issues. In doing so they are responsible for determining each adult's perspective on each issue, discuss each adult's perspective within the context of their own and write an analysis of how each interviewee's personal experiences, age, etc. have informed their perspective. In completing this assignment students will demonstrate their understanding of the historical forces with which they have been working over the course of the year and broaden their understanding of perspectives other than their own.
Assessing the Path Forward: This assignment requires students to interview two adults about methodologies for change. The students will bring their historical knowledge to these interviews to contextualize and frame questions such as, "Which is more important to continuing the
201

process of African American uplift: self-help or government programs/intervention?" After completing the interviews students will write an analysis of which historical ideas, approaches and people are most reflected in their interview subjects. This will demonstrate their comprehensive understanding of course material as well further expose them to diverse approaches and ideas about how best to continue the struggle for true equality and justice in America. It will also highlight the idea that virtually all movements are built, to some extent, on those that came before.
Continuity and Change in the 21st Century: In a one to two-page essay, using a variety of primary and secondary sources that they have evaluated for reliability, students will explore how America's role as a global power changed and remained the same in the post-Cold War Era. They will specifically examine how the collapse of the USSR shifted the global power balance and created a sense of security for the West. They will have to consider to what extent that sense of security was or was not misplaced given the increasing tensions as former Soviet client states struggled with the transition out of Soviet control, Chinese global economic power increased and tensions in the Middle East continued to escalate.

Overview
The purpose of Honors African American Literature is to learn unit specific vocabulary that will assist in composing of unit specific essays, to work through grammar that will add sophistication to student writing, to offer reading strategies that will deepen understanding and access to literature, to build discussion strategies that will encourage more nuanced discussions of literature in class and in writing, and to master identifying and using rhetorical devices in persuasive writing. To reach these expectations, Honors African American Literature will read 10-12 novels, both fiction and non-fiction, and engage in multiple Socratic seminars and debates throughout the year to access the literature. Students will also practice close reading and annotation techniques to assist in their reading. Throughout the year, students will write 810 essays, of various genres, approximately 5-10 pages in length. The essays will cover a variety of genres: literary analysis, expository, persuasive and argumentative.

Freshman English, Sophomore English, or Advanced Sophomore English
Corequisites
African American History 1/2, Honors African American History 1/2
Course Content
The Narrative of the Life Frederick Douglass, by Frederick Douglass; Miseducation of the Negro, by Carter Woodson, and 13th by Ava Duvernay
Students will simultaneously read The Narrative of Frederick Douglass and Mis-education of the Negro, and view the documentary 13th, by Ava Duvernay. This unit introduces students to rhetorical devices such as antithesis, parallelism, apostrophe, sensory details, ethos, pathos, logos, main-claim, sub-claims, and evidence. Students will explain their understanding of Carter Woodson's arguments by identifying ethos, pathos, logos and its influence on the reader. Likewise, students will identify rhetorical devices used by Douglass to further his purpose. Lastly, students will view 13th, identifying Duvernay's claims and subclaims and the film's use of ethos, pathos and logos. The texts and documentary will serve to begin the discussion of the African American identity in America and give students the historical foundation needed to understand the literature.
Unit Assignment(s)
Students will read all of Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and excerpts from the slave narratives written by Solomon Northup, Harriet Jacobs and Charles Ball. As they do so they will analyze the content and the rhetorical technique in the texts. Through three different short (one page minimum generally) written responses the students will demonstrate their understanding of
203

the various methods of control employed by slave owners (such as physical and mental punishment, the denial of education and the use of Christianity and "benevolence" in an attempt to create complacency). In specific relation to Douglass, they will also carefully make note of his use of rhetoric to advance his argument against slavery. This will both help them to fully understand the nuance of his argument and begin to prepare them for their more comprehensive essay that concludes the unit. Throughout the unit students will be reading excerpts from Carter Woodson's landmark study Mis-education of the Negro, portions of Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow and will view the documentary 13th.
As the culminating assessment for the unit students will write a five page (or longer) analytical essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of the material through a comparison of these sources and other outside evidence (either from the course or through their own research); this paper must be typed in MLA format, carefully proofread, and include a properly formatted works cited with a minimum of five sources and in text citations. The students can choose from one of these two prompts: In the mental and physical power struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, who had the upper hand? Make sure you discuss slavery, education and political structures. Mass racialized systems of control have been used in the United States in many ways, especially in the sphere of education. Compare the use of education (or the denial thereof) as a means of controlling African Americans during slavery, the 1930s and in the present.
Beloved, by Toni Morrison
Students will read Beloved, by Toni Morrison. This unit will deepen the students' knowledge of literary devices and techniques employed by authors to further theme and develop characters. Techniques used to further characterization will be the main focus when reviewing Beloved, Sethe, Paul D, Denver, and Baby Suggs. Students will also focus on the archetypal characters found in Beloved and how these archetypal characters represent different movements and figures in history. Students will maintain a character journal, complete reading quizzes, and participate in Socratic seminars throughout the unit. Students will also compare the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and the characters in Beloved to create a more complete understanding of the psychological and social effects of slavery in the United States.
Unit Assignment(s)
As the culminating assessment for the unit students will write a five page (or longer) analytical essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of the characters found in Beloved. This paper must be typed in MLA format, carefully proofread. Students will complete the entire writing process from brainstorming, outlining, drafting, peer editing, and revising. The students can choose from five different prompts all designed around characterization.
Sample Prompts:
204

"Freeing yourself was one thing; claiming ownership of that freed self was another" (111-112). Choose one character from Beloved and discuss the ways in which he or she achieves the goal of "claiming ownership of that freed self."
Morrison's work portrays many hardships and cruel atrocities that were inflicted upon black people during early American times. Is this story designed to parallel a post-Civil War America? If so, what do the characters represent?
Passing, by Nella Larsen
Students will read Passing by Nella Larsen. This unit will introduce students to colorism and its effect on one's identity as they study Irene Redfield and Clare Kendry. Students will also read supplemental material on colorism to help their understanding of how colorism affects individual identity and serves to maintain the racial structures in America. Students will maintain a doubleentry journal for this unit, tracking the Irene and Clare's changing perception of self as the novella progresses. Throughout the unit, students will complete reading quizzes, think-pairshares, fishbowls, and personal reflections to demonstrate understanding of the reading.
Unit Assignment(s)
As a culminating assignment, students will complete an in-class, timed 60-minute essay. Students will have access to the prompt beforehand and are encouraged to gather the evidence beforehand. The essay will require at least three body paragraphs, using three quotations per body paragraph as supporting evidence. MLA format required. Sample prompt: Although much of the novel is centered around Irene and Clare's dynamics, a subplot in the novel is the relationship between Irene and Brian. What does Irene's relationship with Brian reveal about Irene's own views on race and social mobility for women? It may appear that Clare is solely using Irene to gain entr�e back into black society but Clare's presence in Irene's life also serves Irene as well. How are Clare and Irene using each other to work through their own issues? What happens to Clare at the end of the novel and how does your assessment of the ending clarify Larsen's larger message regarding race and/or gender?
The Ways of White Folks, by Langston Hughes
Students will read The Ways of White Folks by Langston Hughes. This unit will delve deeper into the construction of the short story and the elements of fiction used to create successful short stories, such as the plot mountain and characterization.
Thematically, students will examine the construction of race, turning the focus onto how the construction of race and the white gaze affects white people. Students will maintain a reading journal that tracks each short story and Hughes' commentary on the nonsensical behavior of white people because of constructs of race. Students will practice identifying elements of fiction employed by Hughes throughout the unit as well.
205

To track student understanding, students will form small groups that will be responsible for leading the class in discussion on their assigned short story. The small groups will be responsible for developing discussion questions that further thematic understanding, for explaining the construction of the story and how Hughes' use of literary elements, and for deepening a more nuanced understanding of the short story and how it relates to the other texts we have studied.
Unit Assignment(s)
As a culminating assignment, students will complete a 60 min. timed essay that requires them to choose three short stories to write about Hughes' commentary on the effects of racial constructs on the white and black psyche. Students will NOT have access to the prompts beforehand. Students will be able to use their notes and the novel for the essay. Each body paragraph will have a minimum two quotation requirement.
Sample Prompt: Think carefully about how Hughes is promoting the idea of "white nonsense" in the general way whites interact with blacks in his short stories. Likewise, consider how Hughes highlights the self-destructive power of white attitudes. Pick three stories and identify the major elements of "white nonsense" Hughes discusses and the impact those elements have in the story.
Their Eyes Were Watching God, by Zora Neale Hurston
Students will read Their Eyes Were Watching God, starting with excerpts from bell hooks' Ain't I Woman, Black Women and Feminism. Students will focus on black feminism as they read Their Eyes Were Watching God. Students will examine Hurston's use of language to develop the characters and Hurston's take on black feminism. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the text by performing dramatic readings, taking reading quizzes, keeping a reading journal comparing hooks' take on black feminism to Hurston's characters, as well as participate in various discussions.
As we complete the text, students will track and understand how Janie's relationship to Nanny, Logan Killicks, Joe Starks and Tea Cake furthers her quest for a self-defined identity, not hampered by the male gaze and the patriarchy. Students will also engage in discourse debating whether or not Hurston's novel should or should not be characterized as a Harlem Renaissance piece, using their historical knowledge of the Harlem Renaissance from Honors African American History as the basis for comparison.
Unit Assignment(s)
As the culminating assessment for the unit students will write a 7�10 page essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of Their Eyes Were Watching God. This paper must be typed in MLA format, carefully proofread. Students will complete the entire writing process from brainstorming, outlining, drafting, peer editing, and revising.
206

Sample prompts are:
1. Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God is generally considered to be Harlem Renaissance literature. While it was written during the broad time period often categorized as the Harlem Renaissance (late 19-teens to mid-1930s), it can be argued that it does not fit the mold of the typical Harlem Renaissance piece because of its setting. Unlike most Harlem Renaissance literature, Their Eyes Were Watching God is not the story of the rising urban, northern, black middle class; instead, it tells the story of poor, southern, rural blacks. So, how should the text be categorized? In responding to this prompt you must clearly explain what the Harlem Renaissance is (and, thus, what it is not) and compare the book with other literary and/or artistic works of the Harlem Renaissance. You must use multiple pieces of evidence from the primary documents and notes covered in history class, as well as quotations from the novel.
2. Although Zora Neale Hurston's novel is generally considered a Harlem Renaissance novel, the novel is also well regarded as a feminist novel and an examination of the plight of the black woman in the 1920s and 1930s. Using bell hooks' introduction to Ain't I a Woman: Black Woman and Feminism as an anchoring piece, write an essay in which you compare the issues bell hooks explores to the issues Janie faces in the novel. Each paragraph should take up on issue addressed by hook and then compare how that issues is reflected in Their Eyes Were Watching God.
Invisible Man, by Ralph Ellison
Students will read Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison. The unit introduces the students to the Bildungsroman and its structure and purpose. Students will explore the many steps the invisible man must go through to come to a final realization about his identity. Students will share their understanding of the novel by completing reading quizzes, maintaining a chapter summary journal, tracking characters and symbols, and writing mini-essays after each major episode in the novel. At the end of the novel students will be able to explain the various stages the invisible man goes through to come to his final realization about his identity.
Unit Assignment(s)
As the culminating assessment for the unit students will write a 7-10 page essay that demonstrates a deep understanding of Invisible Man. This paper must be typed in MLA format, carefully proofread. Students will complete the entire writing process from brainstorming, outlining, drafting, peer editing, and revising. Sample Prompt: Pick one chapter from Invisible Man that you believe was the most central to the novel's theme or invisible man's character growth. Write an essay in which you explain why the chapter was pivotal to the novel's theme development and/or invisible man's character growth. Pick a symbol in Invisible Man and write an essay analyzing how the symbol function in the novel and what it reveals about the characters or themes.
Malcolm X, by Alex Haley
207

Students will read The Autobiography of Malcolm X, by Alex Haley. The unit will be paired with the Afrocentric History study of the civil rights movement. They will focus on the most transformative events, organizations and people discussed in the novel while also exploring lesser known figures. Of particular importance will be X's work to develop an understanding of how the goals and objectives of the movement changed over time and what caused those changes. Finally, they will assess the successes and failures of the Movement and X.
Unit Assignment(s)
Students will read the Autobiography of Malcolm X and will write three brief papers analyzing the text at major turning points in Malcolm's life. These assignments will be given following Malcolm's imprisonment, after he takes the Hajj and after completing the text (which includes his assassination in the Epilogue). The students are expected to write a minimum of two pages for each assignment, utilize at least three quotes directly from the text in each and provide supporting historical context and evidence. In doing so they will demonstrate an understanding of the depth and complexity of both the Malcolm and the Civil Rights Movement in which he rose to prominence.
A Raisin in the Sun, by Lorraine Hansberry
Students will read, view and act out A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry. This unit introduces the students to various dramatic terms, such as stage directions, fourth wall, monologue, dialogue, soliloquy, In medias res, and dramatic irony. Students will demonstrate understanding of the text by completing reading questions, discussion questions, and character analysis; as we further our study, students will shift into examining and access the central issue of the American Dream and its accessibility, of lack thereof, and how the different characters, Walter, Mama, Beneatha, and Ruth make sense of the American Dream.
Unit Assignment(s)
Student will write a 4-6 page comparison essay between the Langston Hughes A Dream Deferred and A Raisin in the Sun. The essay will demonstrate the students' understanding of the characters and how or what is preventing them from achieving their dreams and how this relates to Hughes' poem, "A Dream Deferred." Students will engage in the full writing process of brainstorming, outlining, drafting, peer editing, and revising.
Poetry
Students will read various poems by prominent African American poets, including Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, Nikki Giovanni, Countee Cullen, and Maya Angelou. This unit will introduce students to poetry terms, such as line breaks, stanzas, sonnets, iambic pentameter, blank verse, assonance, closed form and figurative language Students will demonstrate understanding of poem by completing close readings, annotations and dramatic readings. As we further our study, students will research and find and write poems
208

of their own and compare the researched poems and their own poems to novels we have studied in class.
Unit Assignment(s)
Students will research and perform a poem, leading the class in a discuss on their selected poem. Students will be required to illuminate the class on the meaning behind the poem and the literary moves made by the poet to support meaning. Students will then lead a discussion on how the poem they chose relates to the units we studied throughout the year.
Sustained Silent Reading
Throughout the semester students are required to read a novel from a selected list of African American authors and conduct research on the author and time period (if applicable). The novel can be fiction or nonfiction, must be a minimum of 300 pages in length, and at an adult reading level (no young adult titles). As students read independently, students will maintain a reading log that tracks when they read, for how long, pages covered, and notes on the reading.
Unit Assignment(s)
At the end of each quarter, students are required to write a 3-5 page reflection of the novel. This writing can be a character analysis, a historical analysis, a book review, or an analytical essay.Students will also create a PowerPointcovering basic plot, assessment on whether or not they would recommend the novel and the challenges of reading the novel on their own. Students will then share the PowerPointwith theclass.

Overview
Latin@/Black Studies is an extension to what students learned in Ethnic Studies. Latin@/Black Studies is an interdisciplinary course that studies the diversity of the Chican@, Latin@, Indigenous and African American experiences in the US as it is conditioned by the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, regional variation and power. Through a counterhegemonic curriculum the class will investigate how during the 20th Century various leaders, and social movements comprised of different ethnic groups brought about change within the United States of America focusing our attention to the Civil Rights movement, Chican@ movement, Black Power movement, American Indian Movement, Women's rights movement, Asian-American Movement, Labor Movement, LGBQTI/Queer Liberation movement and other movements for social change. This class will provide a historical and political analysis of Black, Chicano, and Latino people's quest for "self-determination" and "social justice". Furthermore, this course will address the historical, political, and economic factors that contribute to the formation of Chicanos and Latinos today. In the second part of the class we will study modern day movements and intersectional struggles for social Justice like the Immigrant Rights Movement, The Black Lives Matter Movement, the Environmental Justice Movements, Feminist Movements, LGBTQIA Queer Movements, and others. We will analyze the strategies and approaches of these movements and apply them to problem solving struggles, challenges, or problems that we identify in our communities. In addition to rigorous reading assignments, information is drawn from student life experiences, major newspapers, culturally conscious musicians, and alternative media. The current information will allow us to see historical trajectories, contemplate social action, and make course material relevant.

Memory Can not Be Burned: The study of Indigenous Civilizations in Mexico and Central America through the Codex Project
The community that I teach in has a student population that is primarily Central American from the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, and others. This unit studies the Indigenous civilizations of these countries while focusing on some of their major accomplishments like Hieroglyphics, Mathematics, Architecture, Astronomy, Forms of Government, Medicine, Art and sculpture, and others. We will then examine how during the period of Spanish Colonialism the Mayas books were burned by the invading Spanish forces We will critically analyze through careful reading, class discussion, writing, and debate why the Spanish colonizers would burn the ancient wisdom of the Mayas later on the Mexica and other Meso-America Indigenous People's books also known as Amoxtlis or Codices. Finally we will study how Indigenous people through word of mouth, dance, music, art, and literature kept their cultural traditions alive and vibrant.
Unit Assignment(s)
1. Students will create a Codex or Amoxtli with art supplies highlighting a modern interpretation of Indigenous art, creating a Map of the Maya world in their home country, creating Maya mathematics, analyzing an Indigenous accomplishment, studying the Nahuii Ollin, and other aspects as well. Teacher will walk the students through these different activities.
2. Students will also write an informative, explanatory essay examining Indigenous people's resistance to colonialism and fighting for cultural survival. Quotations for the essay will be taken from The Popol Vuh and also Bill Bigelow's article: Burning Books and Destroying Peoples.
Resistance to Colonialism in Africa, Resistance to enslavement, and resistance to Jim Crow in the US
During this unit students will study the history of colonialism in Africa by studying the work of John Henrick Clarke, Molefi Kete Asante, Malcolm-X, Franz Fanon, and other Black historians. This is a unit that helps students to understand the relationship between Spanish Colonialism of Indigenous People's Land and the theft of millions of people taken From Africa and forced unto ships and brought to the Americas. This unit is incredibly emotional as students learn about the violence and warfare that was taking place in Africa as people were being taken captive, as gold and other precious metals and ivory were being taken from Africa at an alarming rate and lasting for hundreds of years. Students will read excerpts from Dr. Molefi Kete Asante's textbook: African American History: A Journey of Liberation that will describe the resistance that African people mounted on the continent of Africa as they fought the colonizers, on the actual ships detailing rebellions and insurrections, and the resistance and escapes that were mounted once Africans of different national and ethnic groups were brought to the Americas. We will also critically read a powerful reading called Burning Books and Destroying Peoples written by Bob Peterson which will connect the history of Indigenous and African people during this system of Colonialism. Students will then study the institution of slavery in the US, the Abolitionist
211

movement, The Civil War, Emancipation, Reconstruction, the backlash to reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow Laws and Segregation and resistance to these laws and racist practices leading up to the Civil Rights Movement.
Unit Assignment(s)
In this unit students will write a process essay that will analyze how African Americans resisted enslavement on the continent of Africa, on the ships during the middle passage, during enslavement, during the abolitionist movement and during the Civil War. Students will be asked to think about how the history of African-Americans is often times written in textbooks as the victims of slavery and colonialism but rarely from a resistance perspective. As part of the essay students will also write about how the "founding fathers" and other important historical figures and presidents are often times valorized for different achievements but rarely looked at critically for their involvement and profiting off of slavery and Native American land theft. The recent debates about Confederate monuments will be brought up in a Socratic Seminar that is also connected to the written essay.
The Civil Rights and Black Power movements in the US
During this unit students will study deeply the different aspects of the Civil Rights movement, Black Power Movement and other human rights movements happening in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in the US. Students will study Dr. King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail and his outline of creating a non-violent direct action campaign that would create a crisis situation for government leaders to respond to. The four steps of a campaign were: Collect the facts to determine if injustice exists, negotiate, self-purification and direct action. We will use these four steps to study successful campaigns in the civil rights movement like the Montgomery bus boycott, the Birmingham Movement to end segregation, the march on Washington, the Selma to Montgomery March, opposition to the war in Vietnam and the Poor People's Campaign. We will also juxtapose Dr. King, the SCLC, SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and other Civil Rights organizations with the approaches of Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity as well as the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. We will read texts from Malcolm-X like Message from the Grassroots and Prospects for Freedom in 1965 as well as the Black Panther Party's ten-point platform as well as looking at their social and survival programs that were intended to meet the needs of the community. We will debate and dialogue about the merits, benefits, and drawbacks of each of the approaches and find ways that both approaches were successful in realizing liberation for Black and oppressed people in the US.
Unit Assignment(s)
This unit will also involve a Socratic Seminar where students will read different speeches and essays by leading Civil Rights leaders Dr. King as well as Malcolm-X. We will also look at the writings and speeches of Angela Davis, Elaine Brown, Erica Huggins, Correta Scott King, and other leading female Civil Rights Leaders. The Socratic Seminar will involve students dialoguing about the merits and drawbacks of different approaches and ideologies used during the
212

movement. Students will also write an essay where they consider arguments and counter arguments of the different leaders and organizations outlining the movement's successes and failures. Students will learn the history of the movements as well as learning about different strategies to achieve similar goals. Students will also learn to have a class discourse and also put their reading and discussion into an essay that includes in direct quotations, in text citations in MLA format, a works cited page, and five levels of analytical writing. The five levels are: Explicit, Implicit, Interpretation, Theoretical and Applicable.
Central American and Mexican Testimonies and the Immigrant Rights Movement: from 20052018
This unit will explore the historical context of why people migrate from their home countries. We will study the specific histories of Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, as well as other Central, South American, Caribbean and countries around the world. We will study the civil wars, and state sponsored violence that took place in these countries as well as Indigenous led movements for defense of land, culture, and humanity. We will study liberation theology and other ways that people fought back against state violence during this time. We will also study Global Migration that is taking place in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe to gain a global context. Historical examples of immigrant oppression will be studies such as the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), Mexican Repatriation (mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US from 1929-1936), Japanese Internment Camps (1940s), and the most recent Child and family detention happening in 2018. We will study resistance to each of these events and study most recently the mass marches of 2005-2006, to the Dreamers Movement, to student walkouts against anti-immigrant policies in 2017-2018.
Unit Assignment(s)
This project is designed so that you can learn more about yourself by interviewing family members and finding out more information about where your parents come from. You will create maps of the country or countries that your parents are from and will find out more about the specific geographic locations that your family is from. We will create stories based on the interviews we conduct and will share them with each other both in the classroom and at a community culture night where parents will be invited to see our projects and hear each other's stories. What steps will you take to complete the project? 1. You will be creating a family tree tracing your parents, grandparents, and great grandparent's history. This project is about who you are and where you come from. I will give you a rough draft to work from and then you will need to creatively come up with a way of organizing your family tree in a way that makes sense. Make sure to include parents, grandparents, and great grandparents names, birthdays (if possible), and birthplaces including cities/towns/pueblos, states, and countries that they were born. We will also be asking our family member what languages they speak (many family members speak English, Spanish and also an indigenous language). It's okay if you don't have everyone's names and information but I am asking students to investigate and find out as much information about your family as you can. 2. You will also draw a map of the country or countries that your parents are from locating the birthplace (city, town, and state) of your parents,
213

grandparents, and if possible your great grandparents. We can also trace any type of migration that your family may have made inside the country or between countries on their way to the US. The maps can be 8'11' (regular size of a paper) or a little smaller or larger and should include color. 3. You will put the family tree, the maps, and pictures of your family on either a poster or a trifold "science fair style" poster board. The poster can also include pictures of your parent's hometown, traditional clothing worn in your home country, cultural traditions, foods, festivals, or any other relevant images to your family, the country that your parents are from and your ethnic background. 4. You will conduct oral interviews with their parents, grandparents, or other family members and will record this interview using a computer or a phone. After you conduct the interview take time to listen to the interview and follow up with other family members if you have any unanswered questions. You will then be asked to turn the audio recording into a short story or "oral history" performance about the specific town, city, community that your parents are from. The performance can be you telling a story, reciting a poem, performing or taking on the persona of the parent that you interviewed and allowing your parent's words (with some additions) to tell the story that you would like to share. You will need to create a ppt presentation (6 slides) which will help you to tell the story of your family. 5. We will be creating large maps for each individual country where students can pin point where their families are from. Students will create large scale maps of El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Peru, The US, Spain and any other country where our families are from. Each class period will be in charge of a specific map for one of the countries represented by our student population. The maps will be displayed in the multi-purpose room on a family night where parents will be invited to see the research that we have worked on and hear different student performances. 6. The Family Tree Projects, large scale maps and the performances (story telling) and poetry will be shared at a community culture night. At this night we will invite parents and community members to come to the multi- purpose room for a community cultural night of story-telling and cultural celebration where we will have food, music, and possibly some dancing. A select group of students will perform their stories for the parents and community members present. Everyone will help with one of the aspects of setting up for this special night. We will need help with organizing food donations for the night, setting up the family trees and the maps, organizing appropriate music (from each individual country), student volunteers willing to translate parts of stories, and other needs that will come up. I am hoping that students can help with each of these responsibilities Finally, students will also write a process essay based on US intervention in Central America and Mexico based on Juan Gonzalez book and film, called Harvest of Empire" as well as other readings in our "Unit Reader."
The East LA Walkouts 50th Year Anniversary
2018 is the 50th anniversary of the East LA Walkouts where mostly Chicano students in five schools in East LA organized a series of Walkouts and Demonstrations to demand changes in their high schools. Similar high school demonstrations took place throughout the Southwest in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas calling for similar demands from the ones made in Los Angeles. During the same time there was movements on college campuses for Ethnic Studies, Black Studies, Chican@ Studies, Women's studies, and other Ethnic Studies programs. This unit will explore youth movements for Educational Justice from 1968-2018. This unit will also explore
214

different types of Ethnic Studies programs at colleges and universities across the US. We will study events like the 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference which took place in Denver Colorado. At that conference a plan was made for a national student movement that was intersectional with Black, Chicano, Latino, Asian-American, Native American students creating coalitions focused on transforming their college campuses. We will analyze the history as well as the strategies that students used to convince their colleges to create the first Ethnic Studies programs in the nation. We will later on study student actions like the walkouts against Prop 187 in California in the 1990s, the UCLA Chicano Studies Hunger strike in the 1990s, Black Student movements in the late 1980s and 1990s calling for divestment from their colleges with the South African Apartheid government, as well as the immigrant rights student walkouts of 2006-2011, the student walkouts during the Trump Election in Los Angeles, student activism during Black Lives Matter, and finally most recently student activism around gun control and school safety.
Unit Assignment(s)
One of the organizing strategies of the student movements of the 1960s and 1970s was the creation of magazines and publications where students wrote plans, manifestos, opinion pieces, poetry, art, shared photographs of demonstrations and other creative outlets. Students will be asked to create a publication from one of the past time periods based on the historical context of that year or they can also create a "zine" or more up to date publication that includes all of those aspects mentioned above for one of the new campaigns or even for one of the older campaigns but using modern technology. Students will share these publications with each other, teach each other about what they learned specifically about their campaigns, find differences, and also make connections. The written pieces will include direct quotations, citations, and critical analysis. Students will also engage in dialogues about the merits, strategies, and effectiveness of current and past student movements and will write about what Ethnic Studies, Latino/Black Studies means to them.
The Chicano Movement in the fields, in the urban communities, in schools, and in connection with the Civil Rights Movement
During this unit students will learn about the role of Cesar Chavez, Delores Huerta and the Mexican American Farm workers during the great farm worker movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Students will read the speeches of the two iconic leaders as well as study primary and secondary sources that are records of the time period. We will study the role of the Filipino farm workers led by leaders like Phillip Veracruz and Larry Itliong and how the Filipinos and Chicano Farm workers created the United Farm Workers (the first labor union of the farm workers) in the 1960s. We will also study the role of the African-American Civil Rights organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, The Congress of Racial Equality, and the Black Panther Party worked closely with the United Farm Worker Movement during this movement. We will study the strategies and approaches that Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement used in Montgomery, Birmingham, Washington DC, and Selma to achieve citizenship rights for African-Americans and how Cesar and the Farm worker Movement utilized similar approaches during the farm worker movement. Students will
215

also study movements that were growing in the inner city Chicano communities throughout the Southwest like the Crusade for Justice in Denver Colorado led by Rudolfo "Corky" Gonzales, La Raza Unida Party that started in Texas and grew to cities across the Southwest, we will also study the Alianza movement led by Reis Lopez Tijerina and the struggle for land rights and creating legal challenges to parts of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that were never met by the US government. Finally, many people don't know but the Poor People's Campaign which was Dr. King's vision of confronting the poverty that was being created by US policy was an intersectional movement supported by many leaders of the Chicano Movement including Corky Gonzales and Reis Lopez Tijerina. When King was killed many Chicano leaders still went to the Poor Peoples Campaign. Some of the questions we will grapple with are: 1. What were the demands that were similar from the fields to the urban communities. 2. What was similar to the ways that Chicanos (Mexican-Americans) were being treated in the southwest to the way that African-Americans were being treated in the South? 3. What were the similar strategies that were used during the Civil rights Movement and Farm Worker movement?
Unit Assignment(s)
Stencils for Social Justice, time line project, and Essay: Students will create a graffiti stencil and a short "museum style" paragraph biography or analysis of their stencil and display these stencils in the school. The written component will focus on the most important parts of this person's life including their commitment to social justice, different campaigns that they organized, the accomplishments they were able to achieve, the people that they worked with and the people that followed their lead, the organizations that they worked with, and the strategies that they used to achieve their goals. Focus on the most important parts of their lives focus on their importance as a historical figure. Why should they be remembered? What should they be remembered for? What is their legacy? What did they accomplish? What alliances did they have and how did they cooperate with other racial and Ethnic Groups in the fight for Civil Rights.
Students will work in groups of 2 and will select their stencil project subjects from the many different units that we studied throughout the unit. Students will also create a time line of the most important events from this group and will also write an MLA style essay with in text citations and a Works Cited page.

The Chicano Pop Up Book Movement and the struggle to defend and expand Ethnic Studies in the US
With the help of local professors Elias Serna and John Avalos Rios students will be exposed to the Xicano Pop UP book Movement (XPUB). The XPUB unit came after the students learned about the 1968 East LA Chicano student walkouts and the 1963 Birmingham Children's march. In both of these historical topics it was students and young people that used non-violent direct action to change policies in their local community and impact change at a national level. As a way to connect the past to the present students then studied Daniel Solarzano and Tarra Yosso's article: Leaks in the Chicana/o Education Pipeline. Students looked at the data of Chicano, Latino, and African American Push out rates at a national, state, and city level and we talked about ways that the schooling system fails students and doesn't provide them with the curriculum and approaches that keep them in school. Elias Serna and Johnavalos Rios then visited my students multiple times over the course of a few weeks to introduce the concept of the Pop Up Book Movement to my students and to give them strategies and ways to create popup art connected to the history and current struggles that we were studying. The basic idea was that 500 years ago the Maya people's books were burned by the Spanish colonizers, in 2011 the Ethnic Studies was being banned in Arizona but it is popping back up in LA and in California. After reading about the movement to create Ethnic Studies programs at the collegiate level beginning with the Third World Liberation Front at San Francisco State University and then followed up with struggles to create more Ethnic Studies, Black Studies, and other disciplines. We studied closely the Tucson Mexican-American Studies program and the positive impacts that the program had on the students. We focused our attention on the struggle in Tucson, Arizona to preserve Ethnic Studies and about the movements in Texas and California to expand Ethnic Studies, students then picked topics that they learned throughout the year to create Pop up books on. Students picked topics that they learned throughout the year to create Pop up books on. Topics ranged from the 1968 East LA Walkouts, The 1963 Birmingham Children's March, The 1963 March on Washington, and the unity between Filipino and Chicano Farm Workers, Soldaderas of the Mexican revolution, the Black Lives Matter Movement, the Freedom Rides, Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity, the Black Panther Party, and many more.
Unit Assignment(s)
Students will work in pairs to create a pop-up book project and write an essay to document the history of the movement and to connect it to the Xicano Pop Up Book Movement. Students were given directions to either draw images on their own or to find images from the internet that they then cut our using scissors and Exacto Knives in order to outline the shapes of people as opposed to just pop up squares and rectangles. Students glued the images to card stock paper that was then strategically placed on the board using pop up strips and tape in order to create a "scene" from a specific moment in the movement. While students are physically creating the pop-up book they are also reading different articles related to the Ethnic Studies Movement and related to their specific research topic. I asked students to write a three-page research essay about their topic and about the goals and ideas of the Xicana/o Pop Up Book Movement. The
217

essay needs to be in MLA format, with in text citations and a Works Cited Page. Students also copy and pasted a paragraph about their topic on the top of their pop-up book so that people that are looking at the pop-up books can read about the topic before they open the book. Finally students will also create a performance with chants, soundscapes, or theater to present their pop-up books and also present the information to the class.

Black Lives Matter and Resistance to The Prison Industrial Complex and the criminalization of youth in LA and across the country.
Black Lives Matter: From Oscar Grant to Mike Brown to Charlottesville Virginia: Racial Profiling, police violence, police murdering Black and Brown citizens, mass incarceration, and the rise of white supremacist hate groups is on the news every day right now in 2018. The prison population has increased 700% since the end of the 1960s which was also the end of what some people think is the "end" of the Civil Rights Movement. In this unit we will study the eras of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and mass incarceration by reading Michelle Alexander's Book: "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness" We will also read excerpts from the young adult novel called "the Hate you Give" by Angie Thomas which is an excellent book about what it is like to grow up a teenager during this era during police killings of youth like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Oscar Grant. Students will try to find the connection between police violence against communities of color and mass incarceration. We will study the privatization of the prison system and the rise of the "for Profit" prison model which is close to a 100 billion dollar business which is traded on Wall Street. We will study the war on drugs and how it has impacted communities of color as well as disproportionate sentencing laws, three strikes laws, and racial profiling and how it has impacted generations in Inner City America. At
218

the same time there is a growing movement called Black Lives Matter, Critical Resistance is a prison abolitionist movement, the Immigrant Rights Movement, and other coalitions that are fighting for abolition, reform, or radical changes to the current prison and policing system in the US.
Unit Assignment(s)
Black Lives Matter and Resistance to The Prison Industrial Complex and the criminalization of youth in LA and across the country. Learning Goal -Teach in: 1. Students will research different aspects of racial profiling like the Stop and Frisk law in New York City and how the community in New York worked to study and research this problem, created demands for change to the policies, organized direct action campaigns and ultimately changed the policy. 2. Students could also research for example the Black Lives Matter demands for police to wear body cameras and show why that demand was made based on research, how did the movement create this goal, how did the advocate for the goal, how did negotiations work, and ultimately how did they convince police departments to agree to this demand? What changes has this made? 3. other groups could present "Know your rights" workshops in collaboration with racial justice community organizations.
Essay: Students will also be asked to turn their research into well written research essays about the topics using evidence collected from readings, from community-based research, and from their own experiences.
Infographics: Students will also create information graphics about their specific topic and it will be presented at their teach in.
Los Angeles Based local movements for social change project
During this project students will go through the following steps: 1. This project will analyze the different human rights struggles that are currently taking place in Los Angeles. 2. The student's job is to pick a specific human rights violation that is currently taking place in the city of Los Angeles and an organization or campaign that is currently working to challenge this issue. 3. Students will need to research the human rights issue and talk about the history behind it and how it is impacting people in Los Angeles. 4. Student project will also highlight a person, community, organization, or movement that is working to create a more just, equal, and fair Los Angeles. Leading up to the project students will study Ron Finley's movement to create "greener" spaces in South Central Los Angeles by creating gardens on the strip of land between the houses and the street. These community gardens that are outlined in his Ted Talk called the Guerrilla Gardner which is very popular. In the talk he, talks about he is "growing a nourishing food culture in South Central L.A.'s food desert by planting the seeds and tools for healthy eating" We will also read articles, watch other short documentary videos about Finley and study the impact of "food deserts" on inner city communities in Los Angeles. We will look at how students for example at Roosevelt High School used their classroom through a partnership with "Market Makeovers" which is connected with researchers at UCLA to remodel neighborhood
219

"bodegas" or corner markets to sell more fresh produce and healthy options to people that live in their communities. We will also study the work of East Yards for Environmental Justice and their campaign to shut down the Exide Battery Recycling plant which has been polluting the South East Los Angeles Communities of Bell, Huntington Park, South Gate, Commerce, Vernon, and East LA. Mark Lopez who is the executive director of the organization is a third generation environmental justice activist. He recently won the Goldman Environmental Justice Prize which is an extremely prestigious international award for successfully campaigning not only for the Exide battery recycling plant to shut down but for the state of California to clean up the toxic lead waste that has been left behind in these communities. These two examples are of communities coming together to solve problems and come up with solutions. Mark has come to speak to my students the past few years in relation to this project. You can see a short video about his work here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAzddXYoR6s. Below are examples of projects that students could research:

Course Content
Unit 1: Pre-Colonized Africa, the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, and a New Nation
Through reading, analyzing, and discussing Toni Morrison's A Mercy, class participants will orient themselves within a perspective that acknowledges Africa as a geographical, conceptual, and cultural point of origination for diasporic blacks in the U.S. and elsewhere and insists upon the value of seeing, knowing, and articulating blackness before New World Slavery. Participants will also join Morrison in an understanding of slavery on the North American continent prenational independence, in what Morrison has called an "ad hoc society" predating a concretized, "raced" notion of slavery. Students will readinformational texts such as The Black Jacobinsby CLRJames. to create a critical framework that includes the African Diaspora Participants' engagement of these texts via close reading strategies such as AP Central's SOAPSTone, active annotation, and interactive journaling will assist them as they explore the cultures of several tribes, particularly those in West Africa, the connections between West African and African American cultures which participants will identify, support with rational justifications, and share with the class community via small and whole group discussions will serve as the fulcrum which shifts attention from "African" to "African American." Students will then undertake studies
226

of the Middle Passage and the beginnings of New World Slavery via readings of the first two chapters of Creating Black Americans by historian Nell Irvin Painter and the chapter "Systemic Racism: A Comprehensive Perspective" from Joe Feagin's Racist America.
Unit Assignment(s)
Cultural Detective Work: Students will conduct research to solve the mystery of the free blacksmith in Toni Morrison's A Mercy. A free black man and a skilled workman in 1600s North America who has never known bondage nor did his father before him, this character presents readers with a worthy puzzle. For this project, students will seek the possible conditions under which his unfettered presence on North American shores could have been possible.
Unit 2: The Everyday Slave Culture
In this unit, class participants will read, analyze, and discuss The Autobiography of Frederick Douglass, which recounts in first-person narration the actual experiences of enslaved people. This texts will be especially helpful in personalizing for participants the everyday experience of the enslaved, allowing them to discover its commonplace horrors, routine tragedies, and innumerable dangers in relation to specific individuals. Students will also read portions of Alex Haley's Roots, as well as chapters from the Painter text, "A Diasporic People," "Those Who Were Free," and "Those Who Were Enslaved." This will provide texture and dimension to participants' understanding of everyday black life from the Colonial period to the era just before the Civil War, including the daily duties, customs, celebrations, language, and beliefs of enslaved black people. Via guided critical thinking question stems to which students respond in interactive journals, and small and whole group discussions, students will be required to find correlations between thethemes, major ideas, and realities of the readings and films such as 12 Years a Slave and Roots. These films provide viewers with a visual inroad into slavery's utter dependence upon casual racial violence and terror. Participants will also study the musical genre of spirituals. Through close reading of lyrics and guided, collaborative, and independent searches for double entendre, a frequent element of spirituals, they will investigate their special role with enslaved men and women who had need of clandestine communication with one another and little to no access to privacy. In this unit, participants will utilize basic principles of research, including data and information collection, analysis, and synthesis, to support written and oral arguments about the texts and topics they encounter in this unit.
Unit Assignment(s)
Seven Sticky Stats: Students will select a population, cultural element, or geographical location of importance to this unit and conduct multi-source research on it by reading a mixture of digital and non-digital sources. From these sources, at least four of which being non-digital, they will generate a typed list of seven little-known or otherwise surprising facts relating to their chosen topic. Sources must be fully MLA credited in-text, and a full list of Works Cited must follow the seven facts. Students will present their facts to the class & share what they feel is their most resonant fact and the source that they most enjoyed reading. The Seven Sticky Stats
227

assignment will be assessed according to adherence to the required number and type of sources, the relevancy of the facts presented, and correct MLA formatting and source accreditation. This assignment teaches participants that knowledge, especially about familiar topics, can always be expanded and energized by new learning. Students also gain practice in the academic skills of discriminating among paper and electronic sources, using formal citations, and creating proper Works Cited Lists.
Unit 3: The Antislavery Movement and the Path to the Civil War
This unit is designed to provide class participants with an overview of the Civil War and its tidings of hope to the enslaved, as well as a tight focus on the singular figure of Frederick Douglass. Students will follow their reading of Douglass' Narrative with a reading, analysis, and discussion of his famous address, "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" This unit will perform the crucial service of increasing students' understanding of the importance of Douglass as the intellectual and activist forebear of Dr. King, who would occupy the role of preacherliberator for later generations. In addition to reading (while using an 'It Says-I Say' chart) and discussing in pairs and small groups foundational scholarship on Douglass such as Robert G. O'Meally's "The Text Was Meant to be Preached," participants will read closely (utilizing AP strategies such as SOAPSTone or the 5-S Strategy), annotate, and share their responses to the works of others in the antislavery movement, notably William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips. The work and writings of Frederick Douglass will thus be placed within the larger context of a lively antislavery/abolitionist movement. Studentswill then shift focus to examine and formulate clear, sophisticated opinions on the thoughts and actions of the man behind the Proclamation which enacted black freedom in the U.S. by reading two of Lincoln's personal letters which express the tension inherent in being the President of a supposedly free republic built on slave labor. The 1989 multi-award winning film Glory will help them understand the motivations of black soldiers who fought for the Union in a desperate bid for freedom. Students will utilize basic principles of research, including data and information collection, analysis, and synthesis to support written and oral arguments about the texts and topics they encounter in this unit.
Unit Assignment(s)
Lively Letter: Students will perform a close reading of Douglass' "What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?" and selected passages of his Narrative by applying AP Central's5-S Strategy. Having done this, participants will practice writing sentences in the style of Douglass, working up to paragraphs, while making judicious use of his favorite words and phrases and his most frequent tone. Students will then craft an entire one and a half-page, typed, double-spaced letter in the voice and persona of Douglass. The letter must be a response to some other letter or essay contemporary with Douglass which participants encounter in this unit and must quote its inspiration directly. They will use a rubric to assess one another's letters based on what they have discovered together about Douglass' writing and have selected as the hallmarks of his style. Through this assignment, students gain rigorous experience with the concept of authorial voice and practice exercising control over its building blocks. The hope is that such careful
228

attention to Douglass' voice aids participants in becoming more conscious of their own and augmenting those qualities which make it singular.
Unit 4: Reconstruction Deconstructed: Black Codes & Jim Crow, the KKK, & Continued Domestic Terror
Class participants will read, analyze, and discuss at least three of the short stories contained in Chesnutt's The Conjure Woman as well as Toni Morrison's Beloved. Thesenarratives carry reader into the Southern Gothic as a harbinger of the darker side of Southern life and will anchor this unit in its linguistic emphasis on the origins of Southern black vernacular English appearing in literature by black Americans, which can be located in the Reconstruction period. Students will read, analyze, and discuss informational texts such as "The Larger Reconstruction," which appears in Nell Irvin Painter's Creating Black Americans andwill lay the foundation for an in-depth understanding of the gains and losses of the post-bellum period. As this unit moves into the early twentieth century, they will read and discuss selections from the classic text of W.E.B. DuBois, The Souls of Black Folk, the anti-racist address by activist Mary Church Terrell, "What It Means to Be Colored in the U.S.," and the anti-lynching address by activist Ida B. Wells, "This Awful Slaughter." Part Two of John Rickford's Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English will assist students in deconstructing this phenomenon and articulating its greater significances.
Unit Assignment(s)
Connecting the Dots: Students will make forays into literary criticism on the tradition of the Southern Gothic. Reading a pre-selected article on the social and cultural significances of literature drawing on horror, the supernatural, or the eerie, students will unearth said significances in one of Chesnutt's stories and provide a precise analysis of how Chesnutt achieves them.
Unit 5: The Great Migration, Race Riots, and Red Summers
Students will read, analyze, and discuss Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man as a literary fleshing out of DuBois' insistence upon the color line as the greatest problem and complexity of the twentieth century. This unit will particularly explore how decades of little change in the actual status of black Americans resulted in social unrest which sparked inequality-fueled uprisings and race riots across the nation. They will also read Claude McKay's poem, an embittered, resolute call to arms entitled "If We Must Die." Rounding out this unit will be informational texts such as "Hardworking People in the Depths of Segregation, 1896-1919" in the Painter text and "Vocabulary and Pronunciation" by sociolinguist John Rickford. The Painter text will provide students with anchor knowledge for this unit, which is dedicated to the period between the 1910s and the 1920s. Along with examining its formal and elemental qualities, students will perform the Paraphrase X 3 strategy, boiling it down to arrive at a single, focused theme. They will share and compare these themes by making and keeping "appointments" with one another, later sharing their favorites with the entire class.
229

Unit Assignment(s)
Je Suis Claude McKay: Class participants will brainstorm a list of at least three oppressed groups to which they have reason to consider themselves members. They will then select one community from their brainstorm list. Participants will use at least two sources to gather data and facts that clearly define the chosen population and place it within a clear context of suffering, persecution, injustice or other minority experience. This synthesized information must appear in a one-paragraph, properly cited write-up at the top of the submission page. Then, mirroring the length, form, and poetic elements of the McKay sonnet, "If We Must Die," participants will compose a piece of their own to speak directly to their peers within the defined group in a rousing call-to-consciousness/action. Participants must give their creations a fitting original title. Poems will be shared within a special lunchtime coffeehouse spoken word event. This assignment teaches students that they are more than likely part of more than one community and that there is something of value that they can say or contribute to those communities. This assignment also gives them experience studying the poetic form of the sonnet and using poetry as a vehicle of social discourse.
Unit 6: The New Negro Movement, the Harlem Renaissance, and the Cit
Reading, analysis, and discussion of Wallace Thurman's The Blacker the Berry will drive this unit. Thurman's tome is the perfect selection to follow Weldon's protagonist of the preceding unit who is a black man of light enough complexion to pass for white. Thurman's heroine is an African American woman who must endure the many indignities reserved for the very darkskinned in a color-struck society. Historian Nell Painter's "The New Negro" and "Radicals and Democrats" will provide students with the historical big picture of the time period. They will continue their studies of African American sociolinguistics with John Rickford's "Grammar" from Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English. This unit will focus on a wide range of Harlem Renaissance-era works such as Marita Bonner's short stories, Langston Hughes' poetry, and Zora Neale Hurston's anthropological studies of African American folkways. Students will also read, analyze, and discuss the intellectual underpinnings of the Harlem Renaissance and come to terms with this era as a purposeful, strategic movement, and not the spontaneous phenomenon for which it is often mistaken.
Aforementioned close reading strategies such as the 5-S Strategy and SOAPSTone will aid students in analysis, and charts such as Say-Mean-Matter and It Says-I Say will assist students in arriving at higher levels of meaning-making. Furthermore, writing in their interactive journals, participants will articulate how the essays of DuBois and Locke function as a blueprint of the Renaissance and will express their thoughts on some of DuBois and Locke's most popular and controversial ideas, such as DuBois' notion of the "Talented Tenth," which he first embraced decades earlier and later revised.
Unit Assignment(s)
230

Writing the City: Following in the footsteps of Thurman and the other urban writers in this unit, students will be tasked with creating a short short story of the city. For this assignment of no more than three typed, double-spaced pages, students must present an original character in the context of a city they know contending with a realistic conflict and antagonists. Students will form small groups and create a zinebased around one central theme involving the city.
Unit 7: The Double V Strategy & the Foreshadow of the Civil Rights Movement
In this unit, students will read, analyze, and discuss Mildred D. Taylor'sRoll Of Thunder, Hear My Cry.Set in the sharecropper south during the early 1900's, Roll Of Thunder tells the often forgotten story of the post Reconstruction sharecropping generation and the horrors that proceeded the civil rights movement. Overarching this chapter will be our study of the Double Videology ("[military] victory abroad and [racial] victory at home") as a racial uplift strategy and its overt connection to the Second World War. The overwhelming failure experienced on the domestic front of this strategy will be discussed in depth in Nell Irvin Painter's "The Second World War and the Promise of Internationalism, 1940-1948." This chapter will anchor studies of this crucial period and will explain how the resistance of the U.S. to make meaningful changes in racial equality in the shadow of the War radicalized black (and other) veterans and led to what would grow to be the Civil Rights Movements of the fifties and sixties. Students will critically view two films in this unit. While viewing the 1943 film Cabin in the Sky, participants will take notes in their interactive journals on the pronounced militarism in the film, which reveals the national occupation with the War. Participants will also see the film Tuskegee Airmen, which depicts the men of color and valor who served as military pilots during the WW II. While viewing this film, students will note in their journals the ways in which the characters explicitly or implicitly refer to the Double V uplift philosophy. These journal assignments will lead to discussion and writing on broader questions on the impact of social moments on art and the role of art in presenting social moments. The language emphasis of this unit will come from both a study of Cab Calloway's Hepster Dictionary and continued reading of John Rickford's Spoken Soul: The Story of Black English with the chapter "History."
Unit Assignment(s)
Black History Celebration:Students willplan, organize, and execute a celebration of Black History Month that will be open to the school community and to the families of the class participants. The celebration must incorporate a welcome address, historical context for each presentation, as well as various elements of art. The occasion must also include visual and sonic ties to West Africa. Attendance ofat least three out-of-class planning sessions is required, as is proof of out-of-class communication within and across teams. Participants will be assessed on the execution of their task, the freshness of their approach, and the symmetry of their team's contribution to the overall message and feel of the whole. This assignment gives participants a chance to reflect on what they have learned in the course and elsewhere up to this point, to work collaboratively with their peers to reflect and present their knowledge, and to include the community in their learning and celebration.
231

Unit 8: The Movement
The novelThe WatsonsGo To Birminghamwill take students into the very real dangers faced by young black familiesin the South during the "Freedom Summer" of 1964. They will also read, discuss, and analyze informational texts such as "Protest Makes a Civil Rights Revolution" in Nell Irvin Painter's Creating Black Americans, "Education" insociolinguist John Rickford'sSpoken Soul: The Story of Black English, and selections from Michael Eric Dyson's in-depth look at Martin Luther King, Jr. the man, I May Not Get There With You and CornelWest'sRadical King. Writing short paragraph responses to guided critical thinking questions stems as well as free-form free-writes to one-word prompts, they will clearly articulate views on documentaries such as Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls and Stanley Nelson, Jr.'s Freedom Summer. Studentswill be encouraged to share with the entire class either a formal written response or a free write.
Unit Assignment(s)
Double-Take Formal Essay: Students will perform a critical "double-take" by composing a fivepage paper that examines the relationship between a literary or artistic rendering of an event, era, or figure within the Civil Rights Movement and a documentarian or scholarly one. They will have their choice of two topics: the relationship between Randall Dudley's poem "Ballad of Birmingham" and Spike Lee's documentary 4 Little Girls or the relationship between Ava DuVernay's film Selma and Michael Eric Dyson's scholarly treatise I May Not Get There With You. In this paper they are tasked with planning, organizing, and executing an evidence-based essay which discusses the ways in which two very different works on the same topic reinforce, question, or destroy each other's presentation of the event, era, or historical figure in question. The essays must contain a proper introduction with a thesis statement, multiple body paragraphs which support the thesis and which present a claim, provide evidence to back it up, and offer commentary which connects the dots for the reader, and a proper conclusion, the scope of which moves beyond the works under consideration into the realm of the "global and noble," as is taught in AP curriculum. With this assignment, participants will learn to write solid, well-conceptualized, properly formatted essays, a high school-level skill which prepares them for college.
Unit 9: Black Power & The Black Arts Movement
Unit Description: Students will read, discuss, and write in response to works from across the pantheon of the Black Arts Movement, including Amiri Baraka, Gil Scott-Heron, Rosa Guy, Lucille Clifton, Etheridge Knight, and Nikki Giovanni, among others. Students will also read, analyze, and discuss informational texts such as "Black Power, 1966-1980" by Nell Irvin Painter and "Media" by John Rickford. They will be required to use appropriate Thinking Maps (Circle Map, Double Bubble, Flow Map, etc.) to correlate at least one of these literary works with a musical genre of the era--funk, funkadelic, jazz fusion, soul or disco--with the artistry of Elizabeth Catlett, John Biggers, Barbara Chase Riboud, or Ernie Barnes, and with a film of the
232

time period such as Cornbread, Earl, and Me, Five on the Black Hand Side, Cooley High, and Claudine.
Unit Assignment(s)
Black Arts Movement Show Me, Teach Me: Students will work alone or in pairs to create an instructional video on the Black Arts Movement, presenting an in-depth look at one key figure, his or her work, and that artist's most consistent message. The video must be three to four minutes in length, must include quality editing on either Imovieor Windows Movie Makerand must be posted on at least one social media outlet and on YouTube. Videos must include text, speaking, and video clips/pictures. Videos will be assessed on their beauty, originality, and ability to provide a Black Arts novice with a solid introduction to the arts movement through this look at one artist. With this assignment, participants deepen their own knowledge base about a Black Arts Movement artist, translate their knowledge into a learning opportunity for others, and gain experience in the digital arts.
Unit 10: Long Shadows: Reaganomics & the Inner City
Gloria Naylor's The Women of Brewster Place will bring the inner-city of decades ago to life for students in this unit. Told in vignettes focusing on a collection of diverse tenants in a low-income tenement, this novel will lead students in thoughts about what Omi & Winant call the "racial formation" of the country chiefly through the ghetto-ization of blackness and the effects of that social fact on women and children. Students will pull contextualization for this unit from analyzing and discussing informational texts such asSister Citizenby Melissa Harris-Perry andThe New Jim Crow by Michelle Alexander. Films such asBeat Street, New Jack City, South Central, Colors and The TookieWilliams Storywill be used to frame the conversation on the changes in the Inner City during the 80's.
Unit Assignment(s)
Personal Statement: After reading selections from Michelle Alexander's The New Jim Crow andviewing the Ava DuVernay documentary 13th, students will be asked to compose and present a thorough personal statement analyzing their own relation to U.S. society through the intersectional lenses of race, class, gender, and location.
Unit 11: The 90s and Beyond
In this final unit, students will read two Terry McMillan novels,MamaandWaiting to Exhale,responding in their interactive journals to critical thinking question stems on the novel's sustained commentary on identity and authenticity. They will use Thinking Maps and their journals to bring both texts and the informational readings into conceptual relationship with Nell Irvin Painter's "A Snapshot of African Americans in the Early Twenty-First Century," selected chapters ofBuppies, BBoys, Bapsand Boho'sas well asWhen ChickenheadsCome Home To Roost anddocumentaries And You Don't Stop: 30 Years of Hip-Hop and Hip-Hop: Beyond
233

Beats and Rhymes. By the end of this course, students should be adept at inquiry-based close reading; textual annotation; evidence-based writing; analysis, synthesis, and paraphrase; formal and informal, small and whole group discussion; and critical viewing of film and performance. Furthermore, at this point in the school year, students should be able to express their understanding of the following facts, among others: African Americans are people of the African diaspora with direct and diffuse connections to Africa; there is almost always relationship between the realities of the current moment and the various art that is created and consumed in that moment; and that no moment is born of itself but is rather the result of a previous one.
Unit Assignment(s)
Reach Out & Touch: Students will be given a Hot List of academics and intellectuals currently working in the field of hip-hop scholarship. They will be charged with the task of reaching out to one of these scholars and conducting a twenty to thirty-minute interview on hip hop's relationship to a specific social issue (hip-hop and culture, hip-hop and creativity, hip-hop and language, hip-hop and health, hip-hop and economics, hip-hop and love, etc.). Interviews must be audio- or video-taped, transcribed, and submitted with a preface introducing the interviewee and the topic and with an afterword which requires that the interviewer briefly indulge in ISearch-type metacognition on the experience of having landed and conducted an interview. Videos/sound files and transcribed interviews will be submitted for credit. This assignment will be assessed on the appropriateness of its interviewee, proper usage of the written interview format, the execution of the task vis-�-vis the parameters of the topic, and the inclusion of the video or sound file. This assignment pushes participants to reach out to potential scholarly mentors, craft quality questions, and conduct themselves in a professional manner in order to complete a multi-step assignment.

Overview
In this literature course, we will take an exciting journey through Chican@ and African American literature. We will explore how this literature affects, documents, and creates Chican@ and African American histories, identities, politics, and the epistemologies/subjectivities of Chican@s and African Americans in America. Through our journey we will use novels, short stories, poetry, performance, screenplays, comedy, spoken word, theatre, essays, music, and film to examine the diversity of themes, issues, and genres within the "Black and Brown Community" and the legacy and development of a growing "Chican@ and African American Cultural Renaissance." We will also use critical performance pedagogy to engage particular problems in the literature and in the community. Through group/team work, community service, and interactive lectures and discussions we will delve into the analysis, accessibility, and application of Chican@ and African American literature. We will ask questions around the issues of--and intersections between--gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, language, religion, tradition, colonization, access, citizenship, migration, culture, ideology, epistemology, politics, and love. The main questions that we try to tackle in this course are: How does Chican@ and African American literature represent, challenge, and/or change traditional notions of the Chican@ and African American experience? How can literature be used to activate the possibilities of decolonization, activism, and social justice?
This introductory course to Chicano and African American literature will examine a variety of literary genres - poetry, short fiction, essays, historical documents, and novels - to explore the historical development of Chicano and African American social and literary identity. Units will be divided by time period, beginning with the sixteenth century and concluding with contemporary works. We will examine the historical, political, intellectual, and aesthetic motifs of each era. In each era, we will focus on how authors address important issues such as race, class, nationality, and appellation, and how authors represent the complexities of being caught between multiple cultures that may be defined by those concepts. In each unit of the course, students will read various genres of Chicano/African American Literature, respond to the text in various modalities, and synthesize their own understanding of each time period with the ideas presented in the texts to derive a new understanding of the individual and collective identities as they evolved over time and space. The course will also consider key literary concepts that
235

shape and define Chicano/African American literary production. By the end of the class, students will have a comprehensive understanding of the literary and historical formation of Chicano/African American identity and the complex, even contradictory, experiences that characterize Chicano/African American culture.

Course Content
At the conclusion of every other unit, instructors will facilitate an instructional exercise, assignment, or activity that allows students to process the units' essential questions through speaking and listening skills. In each activity, students will be evaluated on their ability to synthesize ideas presented in different texts and present their positions on the essential questions, both by the instructor and by their peers.
Speech Writing/Public Speaking Essential Questions: How does the process of colonization impact the colonizer and the colonized? When political decision making does take place with unequal power, how does the decision-making impact the outcome of the annexation? How did annexation reflect the mindset of the people in the period of colonization? What is the role of the story-teller in the pan-African Diaspora? How do narratives act as cultural artifacts? In the context of the American Revolution what does it mean to be African in America? What is the African identity? How is it defined, and by who? Description: In this unit, students will compose and deliver a short, speech on identity, how it's defined, and how story-telling can preserve it.
Units 3 and 4: Socratic Seminar Essential Questions: How does the literature from this time period reflect the tension between alienation, assimilation and acculturation? How do we see this playing out in modern culture? How and why does the vocalization of grievances empower the minority? How does the literature and the Chicano labor movement reflect the unique needs of the Chicano population? "How does it feel to be a problem?" What is the double consciousness of the Black person in America in the era of reconstruction? What historical and political constructs made this duality possible? What are the multiple identities that emerged within the race as a result of reconstruction? What was the impact on the collective identity of Blacks in American society? Description: In this unit, students will participate in fishbowl style Socratic Seminars, where they will discuss with and evaluate their peers on questions generated and insight provided on the topic of double consciousness and the collective identity of African Americans in this era.
236

Unit 5: Literature Circles Essential Questions: What does it mean to be Chicano? How has the inclusion into the main stream impact the development of the Chicano Culture? Who is the New Negro? What is the obligation of their work to the race and culture? What is the function of African American Literature in the social and political advancement of the race? Description: In the final units, students will participate in a series of literature circles. Instructors will select a short passage for close reading written by contemporary Chicano authors. The literature circles and group discussions will inform the students' final analysis essays for the unit.

Assessment activities will be based on the writing prompts and rubrics embedded in the 5 units. Student work will be assessed using a holistic scoring guide similar to the UC Analytical Writing Placement Examination and CSU English Placement Test

Unit Structure (~3 weeks/unit) first to second weeks: Close Reading and Discussion. Students will read 2�3 substantial pieces of text for each unit in this course. Units will be overlaid with additional poetry, songs, comics, as students delve into the key texts. Third week: Writing�� Writing reflection and instruction will be guided by the writing reference text They Say, I Say by Graff and Birkenstein. For each unit, students will write an argumentative essay in reaction to a particular thesis or argument proposed by Ilan Stavans within the Norton Anthology of Latino Literature.
Unit 1: Colonization (1537-1810) Essential Question: How does the process of colonization impact the colonizer and the colonized? Description: Students will conduct close readings of texts from the period of colonization in the Americas with a particular emphasis on the records and diaries of early missionaries and explorers. Students will seek both to understand the implications of these texts both from the perspective of people living in the time period as well as from the contemporary perspective. Students will seek to define the implications of colonization on both the colonizer and the colonized.
Unit 2: Annexations (1811-1898) Essential Question: When political decision making does take place with unequal power, how does the decision-making impact the outcome of the
239

annexation? How did annexation reflect the mindset of the people in the period of colonization? Description: Students will analyze how the age of nationalism impacted Chicano literature and the Chicano identity, particularly concepts of the mestizaje. Students will examine the role of Chicanos in the making of the modern United States and theme of modernism.
Unit 3: Acculturation (1898-1945) Essential Question: How does the literature from this time period reflect the tension between alienation, assimilation and acculturation? How do we see this playing out in modern culture? Description: Students will consider how texts from this are reflect the attitudes of nationalism. Reading will emphasize historical texts, in particular the Monroe Doctrine and Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. Students will examine the changes brought about for the Chicano identity as a result of the prevailing attitudes brought on both world wars.
Unit 4: Upheaval (1946-1979) Essential Question: How and why does the vocalization of grievances empower the minority? How does the literature and the Chicano labor movement reflect the unique needs of the Chicano population? Description: Students will critically analyze how the texts of this unit reflect the alienation between Latino subgroups as well as the "fearful relations" between Anglos and Latinos (Stavans 359). Students will examine how the Zoot Suit Riots became a watershed event in Latino history through analysis of the drama Zoot Suit as well as through historical documents.
Unit 5: Into the Mainstream (1980-present) Essential Question: What does it mean to be Chicano? How has the inclusion into the main stream impact the development of the Chicano Culture? Description: In the final unit of the semester, students will focus on the central essential question of the course: What does it mean to be Latino? Students will summarize how the four thematic emphases of Latino literature (appellation, class, race, and nationality) play out in the modern era.
Unit 6: The Tradition of Story Telling Anchor Text: Epic of Sundiata Keita Essential Questions: What is the role of the story-teller in the pan-African Diaspora? How do narratives act as cultural artifacts? Description: Students will conduct a close reading of the introductory speech of Sundiata, and reflect on the role of the griot in the Ancient Malian Empire and its implications for the role of a narrative in preserving a culture. Instructors may choose from the supplementary texts to introduce a more contemporary stance on the essential question, and students will synthesize their own answers to the essential questions with the texts as way of framing the remainder of the course. (Writing Focus: "Entering the Conversation")
Unit 7: Literature of Slavery and Freedom (1746�1865) Anchor Text: Excerpts from David Walker's Appeal and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Harriet Jacobs Essential Questions: In the context of the American Revolution what does it mean to be African in America? What is the African identity? How is it defined, and by who? Description: Students will analyze the effectiveness of the varying rhetorical devices used to make appeals for the humanity of slaves in early colonial America. Students will investigate the relationships between the speaker, subject, and audience of the anchor texts through a series of close readings and writing assignments. Through discussion activities, students will consider the rhetoric of the American
240

revolution and the areas in content and structure where it is similar to and different from the anchor texts and other writings of the time period. (Writing Focus: "They Say: The Art of Summarizing"; Speaking and Listening Focus: Speech Writing/Public Speaking
Unit 8: Literature of the Reconstruction of the New Negro Renaissance (1865 � 1919) Anchor Text: Excerpt from WEB DuBois, Souls of Black Folk and James Weldon Johnson's Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man Essential Questions: "How does it feel to be a problem?" What is the double consciousness of the Black person in America in the era of reconstruction? What historical and political constructs made this duality possible? Description: Anchored in W.E.B. DuBois' notion of double consciousness, students will analyze the re-construction of the African American identity and how it was shaped by the larger political context of the time period. During this unit, students will evaluate the political and cultural constructs that shaped the African American experience during reconstruction as outlined in the anchor texts. Students will also consider the diverging schools of thought that were beginning to surface within the race, and evaluate potential solutions to the "problem" posed by DuBois. (Writing Focus: "They Say: The Art of Quoting"; Speaking and Listening Focus: Socratic Seminar)
Unit 9: Literature of the Harlem Renaissance (1919 � 1940) Anchor Text: Excerpt or short story from Nella Larsen, "Passing and other Short Stories" Essential Questions: What are the multiple identities that emerged within the race as a result of reconstruction? What was the impact on the collective identity of Blacks in American society? Description: In this unit, students will critically analyze the social, political, and cultural components of the Harlem Renaissance and the events leading up to it. Students will examine the various efforts made by African Americans to reclaim and redefine their identities through the arts and other aesthetic trends of the time. Students will also evaluate the way these identities vary along lines of class, gender, skin complexion, geography and other areas presented in the texts. (Writing Focus: "I Say: Three Ways to Respond"; Speaking and Listening Focus: Socratic Seminar)
Unit 10: Author Study (Alain Locke) Anchor Text: Alain Locke, "Enter the New Negro" Essential Questions: Who is the New Negro? What is the obligation of their work to the race and culture? Description: In this midterm author study, students will focus primarily on composing a research paper, anchored in Alain Locke's essay, "Enter the New Negro." Students will evaluate Locke's argument of who the "New Negro" is, what their role is in society, and qualify it, using other readings or authors from the course. (Writing Focus: "Analyze This: Writing in the Social Sciences"; Speaking and Listening Focus: Performance based Task)
Unit 11: Realism, Naturalism, Modernism (1940 � 1960) Anchor Text: Ralph Ellison, The Invisible Man (prologue) Essential Questions: In what ways did African American literature offer a counter-narrative to Post WWII American culture? Description: In this unit, students will examine aspects of more contemporary African American authors and the ways they challenge or defy the ideals of Post WWII America. Specifically, students will unpack the places in the texts where African American literature intersects, overlaps, contradicts or resonates with traditionally American ideals, analyzing their literary elements and evaluating the author's
241

intentions for including them. (Writing Focus: "I Say: Distinguishing What You Say from What They Say"; Speaking and Listening Focus: Literature Circles

Unit 12: The Black Arts Era and Literature Since 1975 Anchor Text: James Baldwin "Everybody's Protest Novel" and Toni Morrison "The Site of Memory" Essential Question: What is the function of African American Literature in the social and political advancement of the race? Description: In this culminating unit, students will revisit the essential question of the opening unit, and evaluate the role of the "story-teller" as protestor. Students will consider the social and political demands on Black authors for and from the race, how the genre has been informed by it, and the tensions created as a result. Students will evaluate different authors' intentions for writing, and analyze aspects of texts that have been crafted for a specific audience, occasion, or overall purpose.

Instructional Strategies are modeled on a district literacy strategy known as "ATTACK" as well as the Reading and Writing Rhetorically model outlined in the CSU Expository Reading and Writing Course. The ATTACK literacy strategy involves the following components:

�

Assign complex texts to teach content. For this course, the content is the historical

development of the Chicano social and literary identity. Teach key academic and domain

specific vocabulary.

�

Teach and model reading and close reading strategies. These central reading strategies

utilized in this course are those used in ERWC and noted below. Ask text-dependent questions

during reading, discussion and writing.

�

Create conversation using accountable talk with text-based answers. Each unit will

involve multiple structured discussions (both whole and small group) in which students will be

required to demonstrate comprehension of the text as well as analyze its significance and pose

questions that require cognitive challenge. Keep writing focused on evidence-based answers

and multiple sources. Students will write in a variety of contexts and formats, but will be required

to use text from multiple sources to support arguments and illustrate ideas.

As described above, reading and writing instructional strategies are modeled after the Reading and Writing Rhetorically model outlined in the CSU Expository Reading and Writing Course.

Reading Rhetorically: All texts will be introduced by a sequence of research-based prereading and vocabulary strategies. -- Survey the text in reader: title, italics, bold, footnotes -- Create questions based upon the text -- Predict: for questions or something to the learning. All texts will be analyzed using analytical strategies such as annotating, outlining/charting text structure, and questioning. -- Read and re-read -- Annotation and marginalia -- Say, Mean Matter -- Double entry journals -- All texts will be examined and discussed using relevant critical/analytical elements such as intended audience, possible author bias, and rhetorical effectiveness. -Summarizing -- Quick cheat sheet summary to be used in conjunction with any notes in order to

242

write the formative essay. -- Capture main idea -- Who/What/When/Where? -- Time period/date of writing -- Themes -- Historical context -- Author's perspective on essential question(s). Students will work individually, in pairs and small groups, and as a whole class on analytical tasks. Students will present aspects of their critical reading and thinking orally as well as in writing. Connecting Reading to Writing: Students will write summaries, rhetorical pr�cis, and responses to critical questions. Students will compare their summaries/rhetorical pr�cis, outlines, and written responses in small groups in order to discuss the differences between general and specific ideas; main and subordinate points; and subjective versus objective summarizing techniques. Students will engage in note-taking activities, such as composing onesentence summaries of paragraphs/passages, charting a text's main points, and developing outlines for essays in response to writing prompts. Students will complete compare/contrast and synthesis activities, increasing their capacity to make inferences and draw warranted conclusions such as creating comparison matrixes of readings, examining significant points within texts, and analyzing significant textual features within thematically related material. Writing: Students will write 750- to 1,500-word analytical essays based on prompts that require establishing and developing a thesis/argument in response to the prompt and providing evidence to support that thesis by synthesizing and interpreting the ideas presented in texts. Students will complete timed in-class writings based on prompts related to an author's assertion(s), theme(s), purpose(s), and/or a text's rhetorical features.
Writing Instruction Text: They Say/I Say: The Moves that Matter in Academic Writing: Description: During each writing workshop in each unit, students will read a chapter from They Say/I Say by Graff and Birkenstein as both a research tool for improving writing as well as a metacognitive tool for reflecting on their own writing practices. Students will use the They Say/I Say writing templates beginning with unit 1 of the course, but will focus in depth on various aspects of argumentative writing process at different points in the course:
In conjunction with Unit 1: Introduction: "Entering the Conversation" (1-16) Students will begin by reading as Graff and Birkenstein write, "If there is any one point that we hope you will take from this book, it is the importance not only of expressing your ideas (`I say') but of presenting those ideas as a response to some other person or group (`they say')" (3) This perspective on writing will be the principle guiding their writing in response to Chicano literature throughout the course. The first unit of study in Chicano Literature will require students to familiarize themselves with this model. In subsequent units, students will focus on the individual "moves that matter in academic writing."
In conjunction with Unit 2: "They Say" (pages 19-29) Students will focus on the first element of the "They Say/I Say" model and develop their skills of "starting what others are saying."
In conjunction with Unit 3: "Her Point Is" (pages 30-41) Students will study the art of summarizing.
243

In conjunction with Unit 4: "As He Himself Put it" (pages 42-52) Students will continue the work of developing their ability to include the perspectives of others in their writing by reviewing and practicing "the art of quoting."
In conjunction with Unit 5: "Yes/No/Okay, But" (pages 55-67) Once they have had ample practice in stating the opinions of others, they will study the three ways to respond to a person's perspective: agreement, disagreement, or qualification.
In conjunction with Unit 6 "Entering the Conversation": Essential Questions: What is the role of the story-teller in the pan-African Diaspora? How do narratives act as cultural artifacts? Description: Students will begin by reading as Graff and Birkenstein write, "If there is any one point that we hope you will take from this book, it is the importance not only of expressing your ideas (`I say') but of presenting those ideas as a response to some other person or group (`they say')" (3) This perspective on writing will be the principle guiding their writing throughout the course. In this first unit, students will familiarize themselves with this model by informally responding to salient quotations from text through dialectic journaling. Students will then formulate an argument in response to the essential question in 1 or 2 paragraphs utilizing the "They Say/I say" approach. In subsequent units, students will focus on the individual "moves that matter in academic writing."
In conjunction with Unit 7 "They Say: The Art of Summarizing": Essential Questions: In the context of the American Revolution what does it mean to be African in America? What is the African identity? How is it defined, and by who? Description: Students will compose a rhetorical pr�cis for at least one of the anchor texts, summarizing its primary argument, how that argument is developed.
In conjunction with Unit 8 "They Say: The Art of Quoting": Essential Questions: "How does it feel to be a problem?" What is the double consciousness of the Black person in America in the era of reconstruction? What historical and political constructs made this duality possible? Description: Throughout the unit, students will focus their writing on analyzing and elaborating on specific quotations from the reading. As an assessment, students will compose a literary analysis of a fictional piece from the unit, and how it reflects the double consciousness outlined by DuBois.
In conjunction with Unit 9 "I Say: Three Ways to Respond": Essential Questions: What are the multiple identities that emerged within the race as a result of reconstruction? What was the impact on the collective identity of Blacks in American society? Description: In this unit, students will work on formulating arguments in response to a text. Using the unit's essential questions as a guide, students will identify an author's primary argument (or central theme for fiction) and compose an in-class essay supporting, refuting, or qualifying the author's stance.
In conjunction with Unit 10 "Analyze This: Writing in the Social Sciences": Essential Questions: Who is the New Negro? What is the obligation of their work to the race and culture? Description: Building on their skills from the previous unit, students will critically analyze the concept of the
244

"New Negro" and compose a short research paper that incorporates at least 2 other sources, and presents a position on the essential question.
In conjunction with Unit 11 "I Say: Distinguishing What You Say from What They Say": Essential Questions: In what ways did African American literature offer a counter-narrative to Post WWII American culture? Description: In this unit, students will compose short literary analysis essays focusing specifically on including "voice markers" in their writing to better distinguish their ideas from those presented by authors or parts of text.
In conjunction with Unit 12: "Analyze This: Writing in the Social Sciences" Essential Questions: What is the function of African American Literature in the social and political advancement of the race? Description: Synthesizing their skills from the course, students will compose a final analysis paper that incorporates at least 3 sources, and presents a unique and informed position on the unit's essential question.
Formative Writing Tasks: For each text: 1-2 Paragraphs Text Analysis: How do these texts reflect the historical, political, intellectual, and aesthetic motifs of the era? Students must cite at least two different sources supporting the claim pr�cis of each key text descriptive outlines of assigned readings Summative Writing Tasks Summative writing tasks will be argument-based essays that require students to summarize and respond to the arguments about the nature and characteristics of Chicano/African American Literature. These writing assignments will require that students summarize the author's perspective on the texts in each unit and then offer an agreement, disagreement, or qualification of his argument.They will use the texts read within each unit to support, refute, or qualify the author's argument. These assignments mirror the requirements of the essays that are part of the California State University and University of California English proficiency entrance exams with the objective of preparing students for those exams. Timed in-class essays and major writing projects. Examples of specific assignment types include: persuasive essays, letters to the editor, argument analysis, reflective essays, text-based academic essays, research projects
Key assignments for the units are modeled after the California State University Expository Reading and Writing Course assignment template. To guide students through the following processes: reading rhetorically, connecting reading to writing, and writing. Please see the attached assignment template for more detail on specific assignments for each module. Examples of assignments include: quickwrites to access prior knowledge; surveys of textual features; predictions about content and context; vocabulary previews and self-assessments; reciprocal reading and teaching activities, including summarizing, questioning, predicting, and clarifying; responding orally and in writing to critical thinking questions; annotating and rereading texts; highlighting textual features; analyzing stylistic choices; mapping text structure; analyzing logical, emotional, and ethical appeals; peer response activities

Basic Course Information Record ID: PNFZBY Institution: Pasadena Unified School District (64881), Pasadena, CA Honors Type: (None) Length of Course: Full Year Subject Area: Language Other than English Discipline: LOTE Level 4+ Grade Levels: 9th, 10th Integrated course?: No Course Learning Environment: Classroom Based Transcript Code(s): (None) Public Notes: (None) Overview The course, taught entirely in Spanish, will focus on the history and creation of the Chicana/o identity in the US and the experience of the Chicana/o people, through the lens of their literature. The course will investigate the emergence of the modern understanding of Chicanismo, alongside pondering the ideas of activism and political consciousness through literature and the role it plays. Students will be expected to use Spanish as the language for all readings, writing, and discourse, simultaneously developing Spanish language proficiency while engaging in literary and thematic analysis. Prerequisites (None) Corequisites (None) Course Content
246

Unit 1: Identity
Essential Question: How are identities formed? Where in our past have we created our values? What parts of our identity do we carry with us? Can identities change? As a way of introducing Chicanismo, first students will be asked to dive into their own identities. In a small sense, students will be asked to define themselves through various societal lenses as a way to understand how Chicanismo and the Chicano identity (or any identity) begins to take its shape. It is in this unit where students will begin exploring intersectionality, culture, language, race, sex, and gender as a means to provide perspective.
Final Assignment: Positionality Narrative. Students will write a narrative, in first person, exploring the formation of their identities. Students will have to define 3 different social systems (gender, race, sex, class, etc.) and explain how these systems have begun to shape their identity. As this is a narrative, and an essay on who the students are, an ever-developing concept, the purpose of the narrative is for students to begin thinking critically about how society has shaped us and what society has deemed important in our lives. Whether they identify within our outside of societal norms, students must first understand the systems around them, before understanding how identities evolve within them.
Unit 2: Mexican Revolution
Essential Question: How was the Mexican Revolution culturally revolutionary? How does a revolution shape who we are and how we see our world? The Mexican Revolution was sparked by a deep need to change the way in which Mexico was being run and who was allowed to run in Mexico. As the agrarian folk of Mexico rose up in arms, they challenged more than the simple nature of who gets land bestowed; they challenged perceptions and concepts of social structure. Corridos changed the way we told stories, soldaderas fought against the patriarchy, and the poor took up the struggle of the many. At a time when the US still had open borders, how did Mexicans on either side take their place in the Revolution? During a time of political unrest, the Mexican Revolution also dealt with societal/cultural turmoil.
Final Assignment: Corrido, mural, vignette Students will have three options to represent how the Mexican Revolution wasn't simply a political revolution. As the unit progresses, students will discuss how the Mexican Revolution became a cultural revolution, changing pivotal parts of social structure. This unit will also help as a foundation for where Chicano identity begins to take shape. Students can choose to write a corrido (the "new" form of oral tradition), create a small mural (classic to the time period), or write a vignette that details the emerging cultural changes, and culture clashes, of the Mexican Revolution. Students will explore how the Mexican Revolution became the inspiration for the later Chicano Revolution.
Unit 3: 1940s Californios, Pachucos, and Pochos
Essential Question: What led to the Californio, Pachuco, and Pocho identities? Were these identities beneficial or detrimental to the Mexicans on the US side of the border? Students will
247

focus on how geography, clothing, and language all function as identity markers. "Where are you from" mattered, as did what you wore and if you could speak the language. These three identities conflict in a myriad of ways, as they introduce the culture clash of what is needed to be Mexican. Who are you? And do you live in the borderlands? What do you need to keep from your familial culture, and what can be discarded? Or should it be discarded? The Chicano identity to follow is a reclamation of these terms, a way in which to understand how and what makes someone a Chicano prior to the term being popularized. Students will focus on the large push for assimilation, and the pushback of those who refused to let go of their Mexican identity.
Final Assignment: Socratic Seminar. Students will read various articles regarding the aforementioned terms and determine what the purpose was in creating the terms. The terms are all words created to identify where one was from, who you were, and how you spoke. During the Socratic Seminar, students will discuss and define the terms and why they are an important piece of the puzzle for the Chicano movement. Students will have to analyze how the terms begin to create a chasm between what we think we are and how others perceive us, within the context of 1940s America. During the Socratic Seminar, students must describe the context of 1940s America and delineate how these identity markers affected the Mexicans that stayed, or emigrated to, this side of the border.
Unit 4: US Civil Rights/1060s El Movimiento
Essential Question: What are civil rights? Who deserves civil rights? How do we determine this? Should we determine this? What are methods of resistance that can promote social change for all? How were they used in El Movimiento? Students will learn about the Civil Rights Movement, which many Chicano authors argue was a movement for some, often alienating those it was meant to protect. Other authors argue that it was the fundamental movement that pushed for the growth of the Chicano Movement. Beginning with the Delano Farmers strike and ranging to the East Los Angeles walkouts, how did the Civil Rights Movement also give a platform to the growth of the Chicano Movement in a nation that often felt alienating? The Chicano Movement started as a movement for workers' rights and found a platform in student organization in higher education institutions. Students will study how others just like themselves were the leaders of such a large, influential movement. The class will discuss resistance and how resistance is much more than a dismissal of the system, but instead a move towards dismantling a system.
Final Assignment: Debate. Students will debate various topics about the Civil Rights Movement and the Chicano Movement. The debate will have them use various sources and support for arguments and claims. In addition to writing their claims and citing support, students will be expected to present their arguments to their peers. The students in the "audience" will act as a jury, choosing which debate team better supported their argument. The debate will require students to focus on the reasons the Chicano Movement felt imminent and whether the movement was a success for all that participated. Additionally, the topics will also include our essential questions, or variations of the essential questions.
Unit 5: Immigration/Latinos in America
248

Essential Question: What does it mean to be an immigrant or the child of an immigrant? How can we resist against negative portrayals and perceptions of people of color? Students will learn about the reasons people from Latin America have chosen to immigrant, the push-and-pull factors that lead someone to pick up and move their entire lives in search of something "better." Students will also learn about the common misconceptions of immigration and those who choose to immigrate. The class also, once again, will shift into a first-person perspective as we explore family immigration stories and how our families and their stories drive us.
Final Assignment: Interview/Biography. Students will have to interview someone in their family, or someone they know, that immigrated into the US. Asking hard questions such as, "Why did you immigrate? And how?" What were their families' lives were like before leaving their country, and how did they change as a result of leaving? Students will take this interview and create a biography of their family member, illustrating the process of immigration and, most importantly, detailing why immigration stories are necessary as part of the greater Latino experience. Students will also have to write a letter to their interviewee, or small reflection, about what they have learned and why telling their family story shapes the person they are.
Unit 6: Revisiting Identity
Essential Question: Who are you? What do you want to be? How do you understand your identity now? Students will be revisiting the concept of identity, diving deeper into culture and how culture can shift depending on eras, labels, and movements. This unit will help further student understanding of their own identify and is development throughout the course itself. The final unit is a critical reflection on the growth of the students and the systems their identities lie within.
Final Assignment: Chicano pop-up book/Final narrative Students will revisit their first narrative, upon which they will add their final reflection and critically analyze how their identities have formed, or transformed, within the context of the class and what we have studied. Alongside the second part of their narrative, students will create a Chicano pop-up book or a small pop-up book that depicts one scene from their narrative as a final take-away from the class. The scene within the pop-up book can be of the students choosing, but must include a piece about Chicanismo and the role it has played in the formation (or reinforcement) of the student's identity. The goal is to have fellow peers open the pop-up books, and without reading the narrative, have an understanding of how each student sees themselves.

Students will create original works using a variety of materials and painting techniques to be implemented in a series of mural projects throughout the school and community. Additionally, students will learn about the social-political, cultural and historical factors which shaped the Chicano Art Movement. Furthermore, the students will be introduced to the work of past and current Chicano Artists in order to highlight its continual relevance as an Art Movement and how it pertains to them today. Prerequisites Art 1A and 1B (Required) Corequisites A/P Studio Art, Advanced Art Course Content Unit - 1 Chicanol Mural Movement - Historical Introduction Chicano Art - Mural Painting is an advance art course with the dual purpose of training students in the art of large-scale painting and examine a dynamic art movement which raised
250

fundamental questions about the nature of multiculturalism in the U.S. and its development as an alternative culture in opposition to the exclusionary and homogenization practices of mainstream institutions. Students will learn about the Chicano Art Movement, its social political relevance and contributions to the world of Art. This unit will use a textbook as a historical reference and have three guest Artists from the Chicano Art Movement talk about their work. I have spoken with several key Chicano Artists who have committed to participate as guest speakers. They include Wayne Healy and David Botello of East Los Streetscapers. They are one of the most influential Muralists of the Chicano Art Movement. Additionally, Patsi Valdez, a Chicana Artist has agreed to participate. Since all these Artist are based in L.A., we will be able to go on a field trip to view some of the murals painted by these artist. Prior to the lectures, the students will formally examine the work of the particular artist as it adheres to the Elements/Principles of design and learn about the individual artist in relationship to Chicano Art Movement. This will enable students to develop a perspective on what they are about to hear and see. As a final project after the lecture series, the students will select an Artist of their choice and will be required to write a two-page paper on the artist. Students will follow an outline indicating the format and the information to be include.
Unit 3 - Introduction to Mural Painting
Students will learn basic techniques and develop painting skills for the development and production of large-scale murals. Students will work on individual projects as well as collective compositions with the intent of helping them further develop their artistic skills to be implemented in the development of our first group mural. Mural Painting skills: 1) Surface preparation: a. Acrylic mesh - students will learn how to prepare the acrylic mesh prior to the sketching of the composition. b. Students will be introduced to the various tolls, paints and brushes needed. c. Students will practice painting on a small piece of acrylic mesh to begin to develop the skills unique to painting on it. 2) Concept Development: a. Students will work in groups of four to select a theme for their group composition. b. Students will individually work in their sketchbook to produce two images addressing the theme they selected. c. Students will return to their group and develop their collective composition utilizing their individual images to create a cohesive composition addressing their theme. d. Students will revisit and understand what the Chicano Mural Movement was, where and when it took place, and why it occurred. They will research the artistic style of Chicano murals past and present in order to help them to brainstorm ideas for their interpretation and theme. e. Students will demonstrate their understanding of the themes in Chicano murals by creating their own interpretation of a Chicano mural.
Unit 4 - Mural Creation
Students will now use the skills they learned in the previous two units to develop, present, and create a group mural. Students will work as a class to finalize their mural. Students will be reminded that murals serve a historical and contemporary exploration, as a public art piece they are used as a medium and inspiration for protest, public and personal history 1.) Mural Creation (mural plan, presentation, sketches and painting) a. Students will understand how murals are
251

being used in the city to better inform the creation of their own mural. They will work with city and community officials to develop a process to follow in order to create their mural, starting with asking/receiving `permits', feedback, to creation, painting, and finally an unveiling celebration (if possible and desired). b. Students will work in their group to present a process of the mural creation. They will present their theme and process to the other groups and receive and give feedback in order to create a cohesive application and creation process. c. As a class students will have the opportunity to decide on the location of their mural and understand the effects of placement in their mural. They will also use this time to agree on a class process for the development of the mural. d. Students will then be able to follow their process to create a mural in their school/community. If unable to acquire a wall to paint the mural permanently, students will sketch/paint their mural on acrylic mesh, canvas or wood panels, in order to be installed at a later time. e. The mural creation process will be very specific to the course the class decides to pursue and how long certain factors take, such as: class periods, days allocated for work, community involvement (if any), re-sketching and re-proposal, collecting of materials to be used, wall preparation, sketching, delegation of painting, painting of mural, drying/finalizing/sealing, community unveiling and celebration (if any).
Unit 5 - Chicano Mural reflections and testimonials
Once the mural is complete and unveiled, students will now have the opportunity to reflect on the process and explain how creating a mural is an empowering experience. The class gives students the opportunity to make a lasting impression on their school and community. Using what students learned from the Chicano Mural Movement on how to construct and paint a mural, students not only learn how to express their ideas through painting and drawing, but also how to be part of a community through public art. Students will be required to reflect and give a testimonial on the transforming effect the class has had on them as artist and individuals. Some questions to consider: What was the most challenging part of the process? How were you able to identify and learn what qualities are important to your school and community? How has this process empowered your identity as a muralist? How do you relate your mural experience with the experience of Chicano muralist? How difficult was it to mix and match ideas and come up with a cohesive drawing of the mural? What kind of direction and life (ideas) did you contribute to this process? How have you learned to work together as a team and how have you discovered new individual talents you did not know were there?
Students can also draw information and inspiration from the guest artist lecture series at the beginning of the course, along with the field notes taken during the mural site visits in Los Angeles County. As a final reflection/testimonial students will be required to write a 2-3 page paper on their experience in the class and the process in creating a mural. Students will follow an outline indicating the format and the information to be included. They will also be required to present their experience to the class. Students will be given a list of options to consider for their in-class presentations.
Unit 2 - Mexican Muralist Movement
252

Many historians and scholars trace the Chicano mural movement back to the Mexican mural movements, from its roots in both the massive wall paintings of the Mesoamerican civilization and in the 16th century Catholic churches that used wall-sized paintings to introduce Christianity to Mexico. This unit will focus around the 1920s, it is during this time that Mexico produced some of its most iconic muralist. Mexican artist known as 'los tres grandes', Jose Clemente Orozco, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Diego Rivera, creating a definitive Mexican style and developing the artistic genre of 'muralismo', or modern mural painting. The movement stands out historically because of its political undertones related to the social and political situation of post-revolutionary Mexico. Much of the content of Mexican muralism focuses on demonstrating the richness of pre-Columbian cultures and its importance to modern-day Mexican citizens and culture. They highlighted the importance of the common man and his place in Mexican society. These artist used their unique styles to teach Mexicans about their heritage and identity, because these were public works of art all people had access to them regardless of race and social class. Students will learn about the Mexican Mural Movement, they will be able to identify the key characteristics of Mexican muralism and the three main contributing artist to the movement; compare and contrast the three; and express, by means of a short essay, and collaborate on a small group project to create a painting of a mural. The short essay will be a culmination of what students learned during this unit and how students identify their own reactions to the three artist (los tres grandes). Since Mexican muralism is designed to be a means of communication and education to those who view the murals, students will be asked to critically analyze and interpret the works of art. What are the students getting from these works? Students will be required to also talk about the primary examples of Mexican muralism and why it was so appropriate for Mexico and its people? Students will follow an outline indicating the format and the information to be include. As a final project after the essay, students will collaborate in small groups to identify a reoccurring theme from the Mexican Mural Movement and create a small rendition of a mural, which will prepare them for our final class mural at the end of the school year. This large-scale painting will require students to identify the theme for their mural as well as the resources needed for successful completion of the project. In the next unit we will focus more specifically on introducing mural painting techniques and how to prepare the class to paint a mural. This painting will be a more traditional work of art and will serve as practice for students who have less experience with drawing and painting. Students will be working with acrylic paint and will have a choice between various surface materials (poster paper, illustration board, canvas, multimedia). This will require students to not only identify the specific content of the mural, the medium to be used in its execution, but also help with finding the applicable skills and abilities that each partner will contribute to the project. Once their group mural/painting is complete, students will complete a self-evaluation of performance on the project, as well as peer evaluations of their group members and their contributions to the project.
This unit will use various textbooks and readers as a historical reference and visual guide for students. This unit will also use multimedia examples to showcase Mexican murals in order to compare and contrast with Chicano murals that students saw in unit 1. Along with lectures, student led discussions and critiques, students will also have an opportunity to use various webbased resources for research on both their essay and group mural project.

variation and power. Through culturally relevant curriculum, this class will provide a historical and political analysis of Chicano/Latino people's quest for equality. This course will address the Chicano/a movement, immigration, literature, music and film to discuss the factors that contribute to the formation of the Chicano/Latino identity today. In addition to rigorous reading assignments, contemporary information is drawn from students' experiences, major newspapers, popular culture, and other media. Students will be encouraged to read a major newspaper every day and to listen to the radio programs. The current information will allow us to see historical trajectories, contemplate social action, and make course material relevant. The course will begin with an in-depth study of Indigenous peoples in Latin America, primarily the Maya, Taino and Aztec civilizations, and the `conquest' of the Americas. The concept of race, class, gender, culture, colonialism, and oppression will be addressed in this process. This will immediately follow with the 19th and 20th centuries and themes ranging from Mestizaje, Diaspora, The Spanish Language in the Southwest, the Zoot Suit Riots, the Bracero Program, the United Farm Workers, the Chicano/a Movement, Latina and Chicana Literature and Feminism (�Viva La Mujer!), the Central American civil wars of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, and Latinos in higher education.

Overview
Latin@/Black Studies is an extension to what students learned in Ethnic Studies. Latin@/Black Studies is an interdisciplinary course that studies the diversity of the Chican@, Latin@, Indigenous and African American experiences in the US as it is conditioned by the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, regional variation and power. Through a counterhegemonic curriculum the class will investigate how during the 20th Century various leaders, and social movements comprised of different ethnic groups brought about change within the United States of America focusing our attention to the Civil Rights movement, Chican@ movement, Black Power movement, American Indian Movement, Women's rights movement, Asian-American Movement, Labor Movement, LGBQTI/Queer Liberation movement and other movements for social change. This class will provide a historical and political analysis of Black, Chicano, and Latino people's quest for "self-determination" and "social justice". Furthermore, this course will address the historical, political, and economic factors that contribute to the formation of Chicanos and Latinos today. In the second part of the class we will study modern day movements and intersectional struggles for social Justice like the Immigrant Rights Movement, The Black Lives Matter Movement, the Environmental Justice Movements, Feminist Movements, LGBTQIA Queer Movements, and others. We will analyze the strategies and approaches of these movements and apply them to problem solving struggles, challenges, or problems that we identify in our communities. In addition to rigorous reading assignments, information is drawn from student life experiences, major newspapers, culturally conscious musicians, and alternative media. The current information will allow us to see historical trajectories, contemplate social action, and make course material relevant.

Course Content
Memory Cannot Be Burned: The study of Indigenous Civilizations in Mexico and Central America through the Codex Project
The community that I teach in has a student population that is primarily Central American from the countries of El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Guatemala, Mexico, and others. This unit studies the Indigenous civilizations of these countries while focusing on some of their major accomplishments like Hieroglyphics, Mathematics, Architecture, Astronomy, Forms of Government, Medicine, Art and sculpture, and others. We will then examine how during the period of Spanish Colonialism the Mayas books were burned by the invading Spanish forces We will critically analyze through careful reading, class discussion, writing, and debate why the Spanish colonizers would burn the ancient wisdom of the Mayas later on the Mexica and other Meso-America Indigenous People's books also known as Amoxtlis or Codices. Finally we will study how Indigenous people through word of mouth, dance, music, art, and literature kept their cultural traditions alive and vibrant.
Unit Assignment(s)
1. Students will create a Codex or Amoxtli with art supplies highlighting a modern interpretation of Indigenous art, creating a Map of the Maya world in their home country, creating Maya mathematics, analyzing an Indigenous accomplishment, studying the Nahuii Ollin, and other aspects as well. Teacher will walk the students through these different activities. 2. Students will also write an informative, explanatory essay examining Indigenous people's resistance to colonialism and fighting for cultural survival. Quotations for the essay will be taken from The Popol Vuh and also Bill Bigelow's article: Burning Books and Destroying Peoples.
Resistance to Colonialism in Africa, Resistance to enslavement, and resistance to Jim Crow in the US
During this unit students will study the history of colonialism in Africa by studying the work of John Henrick Clarke, Molefi Kete Asante, Malcolm-X, Franz Fanon, and other Black historians. This is a unit that helps students to understand the relationship between Spanish Colonialism of Indigenous People's Land and the theft of millions of people taken From Africa and forced unto ships and brought to the Americas. This unit is incredibly emotional as students learn about the violence and warfare that was taking place in Africa as people were being taken captive, as gold and other precious metals and ivory were being taken from Africa at an alarming rate and lasting for hundreds of years. Students will read excerpts from Dr. Molefi Kete Asante's textbook: African American History: A Journey of Liberation that will describe the resistance that African people mounted on the continent of Africa as they fought the colonizers, on the actual ships detailing rebellions and insurrections, and the resistance and escapes that were mounted once Africans of different national and ethnic groups were brought to the Americas. We will also
273

critically read a powerful reading called Burning Books and Destroying Peoples written by Bob Peterson which will connect the history of Indigenous and African people during this system of Colonialism. Students will then study the institution of slavery in the US, the Abolitionist movement, The Civil War, Emancipation, Reconstruction, the backlash to reconstruction, the rise of Jim Crow Laws and Segregation and resistance to these laws and racist practices leading up to the Civil Rights Movement.
Unit Assignment(s)
In this unit students will write a process essay that will analyze how African Americans resisted enslavement on the continent of Africa, on the ships during the middle passage, during enslavement, during the abolitionist movement and during the Civil War. Students will be asked to think about how the history of African-Americans is often times written in textbooks as the victims of slavery and colonialism but rarely from a resistance perspective. As part of the essay students will also write about how the "founding fathers" and other important historical figures and presidents are often times valorized for different achievements but rarely looked at critically for their involvement and profiting off of slavery and Native American land theft. The recent debates about Confederate monuments will be brought up in a Socratic Seminar that is also connected to the written essay.
The Civil Rights and Black Power movements in the US
During this unit students will study deeply the different aspects of the Civil Rights movement, Black Power Movement and other human rights movements happening in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s in the US. Students will study Dr. King's Letter from a Birmingham Jail and his outline of creating a non-violent direct-action campaign that would create a crisis situation for government leaders to respond to. The four steps of a campaign were: Collect the facts to determine if injustice exists, negotiate, self-purification and direct action. We will use these four steps to study successful campaigns in the civil rights movement like the Montgomery bus boycott, the Birmingham Movement to end segregation, the march on Washington, the Selma to Montgomery March, opposition to the war in Vietnam and the Poor People's Campaign. We will also juxtapose Dr. King, the SCLC, SNCC, CORE, NAACP, and other Civil Rights organizations with the approaches of Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity as well as the Black Panther Party for Self Defense. We will read texts from Malcolm-X like Message from the Grassroots and Prospects for Freedom in 1965 as well as the Black Panther Party's ten-point platform as well as looking at their social and survival programs that were intended to meet the needs of the community. We will debate and dialogue about the merits, benefits, and drawbacks of each of the approaches and find ways that both approaches were successful in realizing liberation for Black and oppressed people in the US.
Unit Assignment(s)
This unit will also involve a Socratic Seminar where students will read different speeches and essays by leading Civil Rights leaders Dr. King as well as Malcolm-X. We will also look at the
274

writings and speeches of Angela Davis, Elaine Brown, Erica Huggins, Correta Scott King, and other leading female Civil Rights Leaders. The Socratic Seminar will involve students dialoguing about the merits and drawbacks of different approaches and ideologies used during the movement. Students will also write an essay where they consider arguments and counter arguments of the different leaders and organizations outlining the movement's successes and failures. Students will learn the history of the movements as well as learning about different strategies to achieve similar goals. Students will also learn to have a class discourse and also put their reading and discussion into an essay that includes in direct quotations, in text citations in MLA format, a works cited page, and five levels of analytical writing. The five levels are: Explicit, Implicit, Interpretation, Theoretical and Applicable.
Central American and Mexican Testimonies and The Immigrant Right's Movement: from 20052018
This unit will explore the historical context of why people migrate from their home countries. We will study the specific histories of Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, as well as other Central, South American, Caribbean and countries around the world. We will study the civil wars, and state sponsored violence that took place in these countries as well as Indigenous led movements for defense of land, culture, and humanity. We will study liberation theology and other ways that people fought back against state violence during this time. We will also study Global Migration that is taking place in South East Asia, the Middle East, and Europe to gain a global context. Historical examples of immigrant oppression will be studies such as the Chinese Exclusion Act (1882), Mexican Repatriation (mass deportations of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the US from 1929-1936), Japanese Internment Camps (1940s), and the most recent Child and family detention happening in 2018. We will study resistance to each of these events and study most recently the mass marches of 2005-2006, to the Dreamers Movement, to student walkouts against anti-immigrant policies in 2017-2018.
Unit Assignment(s)
This project is designed so that you can learn more about yourself by interviewing family members and finding out more information about where your parents come from. You will create maps of the country or countries that your parents are from and will find out more about the specific geographic locations that your family is from. We will create stories based on the interviews we conduct and will share them with each other both in the classroom and at a community culture night where parents will be invited to see our projects and hear each other's stories. What steps will you take to complete the project? 1. You will be creating a family tree tracing your parents, grandparents, and great grandparent's history. This project is about who you are and where you come from. I will give you a rough draft to work from and then you will need to creatively come up with a way of organizing your family tree in a way that makes sense. Make sure to include parents, grandparents, and great grandparents names, birthdays (if possible), and birthplaces including cities/towns/pueblos, states, and countries that they were born. We will also be asking our family member what languages they speak (many family members speak English, Spanish and also an indigenous language). It's okay if you don't have
275

everyone's names and information but I am asking students to investigate and find out as much information about your family as you can. 2. You will also draw a map of the country or countries that your parents are from locating the birthplace (city, town, and state) of your parents, grandparents, and if possible your great grandparents. We can also trace any type of migration that your family may have made inside the country or between countries on their way to the US. The maps can be 8'11' (regular size of a paper) or a little smaller or larger and should include color. 3. You will put the family tree, the maps, and pictures of your family on either a poster or a trifold "science fair style" poster board. The poster can also include pictures of your parent's hometown, traditional clothing worn in your home country, cultural traditions, foods, festivals, or any other relevant images to your family, the country that your parents are from and your ethnic background. 4. You will conduct oral interviews with their parents, grandparents, or other family members and will record this interview using a computer or a phone. After you conduct the interview take time to listen to the interview and follow up with other family members if you have any unanswered questions. You will then be asked to turn the audio recording into a short story or "oral history" performance about the specific town, city, community that your parents are from. The performance can be you telling a story, reciting a poem, performing or taking on the persona of the parent that you interviewed and allowing your parent's words (with some additions) to tell the story that you would like to share. You will need to create a ppt presentation (6 slides) which will help you to tell the story of your family. 5. We will be creating large maps for each individual country where students can pin point where their families are from. Students will create large scale maps of El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, the Philippines, Peru, The US, Spain and any other country where our families are from. Each class period will be in charge of a specific map for one of the countries represented by our student population. The maps will be displayed in the multi-purpose room on a family night where parents will be invited to see the research that we have worked on and hear different student performances. 6. The Family Tree Projects, large scale maps and the performances (story telling) and poetry will be shared at a community culture night. At this night we will invite parents and community members to come to the multi- purpose room for a community cultural night of story-telling and cultural celebration where we will have food, music, and possibly some dancing. A select group of students will perform their stories for the parents and community members present. Everyone will help with one of the aspects of setting up for this special night. We will need help with organizing food donations for the night, setting up the family trees and the maps, organizing appropriate music (from each individual country), student volunteers willing to translate parts of stories, and other needs that will come up. I am hoping that students can help with each of these responsibilities Finally, students will also write a process essay based on US intervention in Central America and Mexico based on Juan Gonzalez book and film, called Harvest of Empire" as well as other readings in our "Unit Reader"
The East LA Walkouts 50th Year Anniversary
2018 is the 50th anniversary of the East LA Walkouts where mostly Chicano students in five schools in East LA organized a series of Walkouts and Demonstrations to demand changes in their high schools. Similar high school demonstrations took place throughout the Southwest in Arizona, Colorado, and Texas calling for similar demands from the ones made in Los Angeles.
276

During the same time there was movements on college campuses for Ethnic Studies, Black Studies, Chican@ Studies, Women's studies, and other Ethnic Studies programs. This unit will explore youth movements for Educational Justice from 1968-2018. This unit will also explore different types of Ethnic Studies programs at colleges and universities across the US. We will study events like the 1969 Chicano Youth Liberation Conference which took place in Denver Colorado. At that conference a plan was made for a national student movement that was intersectional with Black, Chicano, Latino, Asian-American, Native American students creating coalitions focused on transforming their college campuses. We will analyze the history as well as the strategies that students used to convince their colleges to create the first Ethnic Studies programs in the nation. We will later on study student actions like the walkouts against Prop 187 in California in the 1990s, the UCLA Chicano Studies Hunger strike in the 1990s, Black Student movements in the late 1980s and 1990s calling for divestment from their colleges with the South African Apartheid government, as well as the immigrant rights student walkouts of 2006-2011, the student walkouts during the Trump Election in Los Angeles, student activism during Black Lives Matter, and finally most recently student activism around gun control and school safety.
Unit Assignment(s)
One of the organizing strategies of the student movements of the 1960s and 1970s was the creation of magazines and publications where students wrote plans, manifestos, opinion pieces, poetry, art, shared photographs of demonstrations and other creative outlets. Students will be asked to create a publication from one of the past time periods based on the historical context of that year or they can also create a "zine" or more up to date publication that includes all of those aspects mentioned above for one of the new campaigns or even for one of the older campaigns but using modern technology. Students will share these publications with each other, teach each other about what they learned specifically about their campaigns, find differences, and also make connections. The written pieces will include direct quotations, citations, and critical analysis. Students will also engage in dialogues about the merits, strategies, and effectiveness of current and past student movements and will write about what Ethnic Studies, Latino/Black Studies means to them.
The Chicano Movement in the fields, in the urban communities, in schools, and in connection with the Civil Rights Movement
During this unit students will learn about the role of Cesar Chavez, Delores Huerta and the Mexican American Farm workers during the great farm worker movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Students will read the speeches of the two iconic leaders as well as study primary and secondary sources that are records of the time period. We will study the role of the Filipino farm workers led by leaders like Phillip Veracruz and Larry Itliong and how the Filipinos and Chicano Farm workers created the United Farm Workers (the first labor union of the farm workers) in the 1960s. We will also study the role of the African-American Civil Rights organizations like the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, The Congress of Racial Equality, and the Black Panther Party worked closely with the United Farm Worker Movement during this movement. We will study the strategies and approaches
277

that Dr. King and the Civil Rights Movement used in Montgomery, Birmingham, Washington DC, and Selma to achieve citizenship rights for African-Americans and how Cesar and the Farm worker Movement utilized similar approaches during the farm worker movement. Students will also study movements that were growing in the inner city Chicano communities throughout the Southwest like the Crusade for Justice in Denver Colorado led by Rudolfo "Corky" Gonzales, La Raza Unida Party that started in Texas and grew to cities across the Southwest, we will also study the Alianza movement led by Reis Lopez Tijerina and the struggle for land rights and creating legal challenges to parts of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that were never met by the US government. Finally, many people don't know but the Poor People's Campaign which was Dr. King's vision of confronting the poverty that was being created by US policy was an intersectional movement supported by many leaders of the Chicano Movement including Corky Gonzales and Reis Lopez Tijerina. When King was killed many Chicano leaders still went to the Poor Peoples Campaign. Some of the questions we will grapple with is: 1. What were the demands that were similar from the fields to the urban communities? 2. What was similar to the ways that Chicanos (Mexican-Americans) were being treated in the southwest to the way that African-Americans were being treated in the South? 3. What were the similar strategies that were used during the Civil rights Movement and Farm Worker movement?
Unit Assignment(s)
Stencils for Social Justice, time line project, and Essay. Students will create a graffiti stencil and a short "museum style" paragraph biography or analysis of their stencil and display these stencils in the school. The written component will focus on the most important parts of this person's life including their commitment to social justice, different campaigns that they organized, the accomplishments they were able to achieve, the people that they worked with and the people that followed their lead, the organizations that they worked with, and the strategies that they used to achieve their goals. Focus on the most important parts of their lives focus on their importance as a historical figure. Why should they be remembered? What should they be remembered for? What is their legacy? What did they accomplish? What alliances did they have and how did they cooperate with other racial and Ethnic Groups in the fight for Civil Rights.
Students will work in groups of 2 and will select their stencil project subjects from the many different units that we studied throughout the unit. Students will also create a time line of the most important events from this group and will also write an MLA style essay with in text citations and a works Cited page.

The Chicano Pop Up Book Movement and the struggle to defend and expand Ethnic Studies in the US
With the help of local professors Elias Serna and Johnavalos Rios students will be exposed to the Xicano Pop UP book Movement (XPUB). The XPUB unit came after the students learned about the 1968 East LA Chicano student walkouts and the 1963 Birmingham Children's march. In both of these historical topics it was students and young people that used non-violent direct action to change policies in their local community and impact change at a national level. As a way to connect the past to the present students then studied Daniel Solarzano and Tarra Yosso's article: Leaks in the Chicana/o Education Pipeline. Students looked at the data of Chicano, Latino, and African American Push out rates at a national, state, and city level and we talked about ways that the schooling system fails students and doesn't provide them with the curriculum and approaches that keep them in school. Elias Serna and Johnavalos Rios then visited my students multiple times over the course of a few weeks to introduce the concept of the Pop Up Book Movement to my students and to give them strategies and ways to create popup art connected to the history and current struggles that we were studying. The basic idea was that 500 years ago the Maya people's books were burned by the Spanish colonizers, in 2011 the Ethnic Studies was being banned in Arizona but it is popping back up in LA and in California. After reading about the movement to create Ethnic Studies programs at the collegiate level beginning with the Third World Liberation Front at San Francisco State University and then followed up with struggles to create more Ethnic Studies, Black Studies, and other disciplines. We studied closely the Tucson Mexican-American Studies program and the positive impacts that the program had on the students. We focused our attention on the struggle in Tucson, Arizona to preserve Ethnic Studies and about the movements in Texas and California to expand Ethnic Studies, students then picked topics that they learned throughout the year to create Pop up books on. Students picked topics that they learned throughout the year to create Pop up books on. Topics ranged from the 1968 East LA Walkouts, The 1963 Birmingham Children's March, The 1963 March on Washington, and the unity between Filipino and Chicano Farm Workers, Soldaderas of the Mexican revolution, the Black Lives Matter Movement, the Freedom Rides, Malcolm X and the Organization of Afro-American Unity, the Black Panther Party, and many more.
Unit Assignment(s)
Students will work in pairs to create a pop-up book project and write an essay to document the history of the movement and to connect it to the Xicano Pop Up Book Movement. Students were given directions to either draw images on their own or to find images from the internet that they then cut our using scissors and Exacto Knives in order to outline the shapes of people as opposed to just pop up squares and rectangles. Students glued the images to card stock paper that was then strategically placed on the board using pop up strips and tape in order to create a "scene" from a specific moment in the movement. While students are physically creating the
279

pop-up book they are also reading different articles related to the Ethnic Studies Movement and related to their specific research topic. I asked students to write a three-page research essay about their topic and about the goals and ideas of the Xicana/o Pop Up Book Movement. The essay needs to be in MLA format, with in text citations and a Works Cited Page. Students also copy and pasted a paragraph about their topic on the top of their pop-up book so that people that are looking at the pop-up books can read about the topic before they open the book. Finally students will also create a performance with chants, soundscapes, or theater to present their pop-up books and also present the information to the class.

Black Lives Matter and Resistance to The Prison Industrial Complex and the criminalization of youth in LA and across the country.
Black Lives Matter: From Oscar Grant to Mike Brown to Charlottesville Virginia: Racial Profiling, police violence, police murdering Black and Brown citizens, mass incarceration, and the rise of white supremacist hate groups is on the news every day right now in 2018. The prison population has increased 700% since the end of the 1960s which was also the end of what some people think is the "end" of the Civil Rights Movement. In this unit we will study the eras of slavery, Jim Crow segregation, and mass incarceration by reading Michelle Alexander's Book: "The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Color Blindness" We will also read excerpts from the young adult novel called "the Hate you Give" by Angie Thomas which is an excellent book about what it is like to grow up a teenager during this era during police killings of youth like Trayvon Martin, Tamir Rice, and Oscar Grant. Students will try to find the connection between police violence against communities of color and mass incarceration. We will study the privatization of the prison system and the rise of the "for Profit" prison model which is close to a
280

100 billion dollar business which is traded on Wall Street. We will study the war on drugs and how it has impacted communities of color as well as disproportionate sentencing laws, three strikes laws, and racial profiling and how it has impacted generations in Inner City America. At the same time there is a growing movement called Black Lives Matter, Critical Resistance is a prison abolitionist movement, the Immigrant Rights Movement, and other coalitions that are fighting for abolition, reform, or radical changes to the current prison and policing system in the US.
Unit Assignment(s)

Los Angeles Based local movements for social change project
During this project students will go through the following steps: 1. This project will analyze the different human rights struggles that are currently taking place in Los Angeles. 2. The student's job is to pick a specific human rights violation that is currently taking place in the city of Los Angeles and an organization or campaign that is currently working to challenge this issue. 3. Students will need to research the human rights issue and talk about the history behind it and how it is impacting people in Los Angeles. 4. Student project will also highlight a person, community, organization, or movement that is working to create a more just, equal, and fair Los Angeles. Leading up to the project students will study Ron Finley's movement to create "greener" spaces in South Central Los Angeles by creating gardens on the strip of land between the houses and the street. These community gardens that are outlined in his Ted Talk called the Guerrilla Gardner which is very popular. In the talk he, talks about he is "growing a nourishing food culture in South Central L.A.'s food desert by planting the seeds and tools for healthy eating" We will also read articles, watch other short documentary videos about Finley and study
281

the impact of "food deserts" on inner city communities in Los Angeles. We will look at how students for example at Roosevelt High School used their classroom through a partnership with "Market Makeovers" which is connected with researchers at UCLA to remodel neighborhood "bodegas" or corner markets to sell more fresh produce and healthy options to people that live in their communities. We will also study the work of East Yards for Environmental Justice and their campaign to shut down the Exide Battery Recycling plant which has been polluting the South East Los Angeles Communities of Bell, Huntington Park, South Gate, Commerce, Vernon, and East LA. Mark Lopez who is the executive director of the organization is a thirdgeneration environmental justice activist. He recently won the Goldman Environmental Justice Prize which is an extremely prestigious international award for successfully campaigning not only for the Exide battery recycling plant to shut down but for the state of California to clean up the toxic lead waste that has been left behind in these communities. These two examples are of communities coming together to solve problems and come up with solutions. Mark has come to speak to my students the past few years in relation to this project. you can see a short video about his work here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAzddXYoR6s Below are examples of projects that students could research:

This course surveys the history, identity, and oral traditions of Mexican American and other Latina/o cultures through the lens of literature. It is a representative overview of Mexican American and Latina/o literature covering poetry, drama, novels, short stories, critical essays and other non-fiction texts.
The course will include literary techniques, modes of expression, trends in Mexican American and Latina/o creativity, and will expose students to the richness and diversity that Mexican American and other Latina/o cultures have to offer. The first semester of the course will focus on literature/texts authored by Mexican American, and Chicana/o writers. The second semester focuses on Latin America as a whole and how the influences of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Central America, and South America have shaped American and Latina/o identity in the U.S. and provide a well-rounded understanding of the cultural elements that contribute to U.S. Latina/o Literature. Students will be exposed to extensive reading of classic and modern Mexican American and Latina/o American literature and nonfiction texts that emphasize their historical and cultural roots in the United States and examine the contested meanings of identity; the relationship between social/political activism and literary expression and movements; the politics of immigration and the border; and the intersectionality of these with gender relations and sexuality within the Mexican American and Latina/o community.

Course Content
Unit 1: Pre-Columbian Civilization and the Conquest (The Rise of Mestizo Culture)
288

Unit Description: This unit will focus on the historical significance of Pre-Columbian cultures in the Americas, the conquest period and three centuries of Spanish colonial rule that saw the rise of the new "mestizo" as an identity that is in constant transformation. An emphasis will be given to Spanish hierarchies of social class as determined by ethnicity and the impact they have on Mexican American identity today. Through close reading and discussion of Pre-Columbian texts like The Popol Vuh and primary accounts of the conquest, the unit will cover questions concerning labels, nationalism, labor, migration, and memory. Through journal entries, participation in think-pair-share discussions, and short informative and narrative writing assignments, students will trace the construction and transformation of ethnic and national identities and the issue of assimilation among Mexican Americans up to the 1960s.
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: "Columbus: Hero or Criminal?" Students will read fiction and non-fiction texts about the arrival of Columbus to the Americas, including the 2 poems below. They will workshop a 3-paragraph response comparing and contrasting the tone and themes of each poem and respond to the following: Whose point of view does each poem reflect and what is the message they each convey? Explain the literary elements of the poems help convey the message. Use evidence from the poems and/or the additional readings to support analysis. Do you agree with one or more than the other? Do you believe Columbus is a criminal or a hero?
"Columbus" By Annette Wynne
An Italian boy that like to play In Genoa about the ships all day, With curly head and dark, dark eyes, That gazed at earth in child surprise; And dreamed of distant stranger skies.
He watched the ships that came crowding in With cargo of riches; he loved the din Of the glad rush out and the spreading sails And the echo of far-off windy gales.
He studied the books of the olden day; He studied but knew far more than they; He talked to the learned men of the school -- So wise he was they thought him a fool, A fool with the dark, dark dreamful eyes, A child he was -- grown wonder-wise.
Youth and dreams are over, past And out, far out he is sailing fast Toward the seas he dreamed; -- strange lands arise -- The world is made rich by his great emprise -- And the wisest know he was more than wise.
"Columbus Day" By Jimmie Durham
In school I was taught the names Columbus, Cortez, and Pizzaro and A dozen other filthy murderers. A bloodline all the way to General Miles, Daniel Boone and General Eisenhower.
289

No one mentioned the names Of even a few of the victims. But don't you remember Chaske, whose spine Was crushed so quickly by Mr. Pizzaro's boot? What words did he cry into the dust?
What was the familiar name Of that young girl who danced so gracefully That everyone in the village sang with her-- Before Cortez' sword hacked off her arms As she protested the burning of her sweetheart?
That young man's name was Many Deeds, And he had been a leader of a band of fighters Called the Redstick Hummingbirds, who slowed The march of Cortez' army with only a few Spears and stones which now lay still In the mountains and remember.
Greenrock Woman was the name Of that old lady who walked right up And spat in Columbus' face. We Must remember that, and remember Laughing Otter the Taino who tried to stop Columbus and who was taken away as a slave. We never saw him again.
In school I learned of heroic discoveries Made by liars and crooks. The courage Of millions of sweet and true people Was not commemorated.
Let us then declare a holiday For ourselves, and make a parade that begins With Columbus' victims and continues Even to our grandchildren who will be named In their honor.
Because isn't it true that even the summer Grass here in this land whispers those names, And every creek has accepted the responsibility Of singing those names? And nothing can stop The wind from howling those names around The corners of the school.
Why else would the birds sing So much sweeter here than in other lands?
Unit 2: Westward Expansion and "Manifest Destiny"
Unit Description: This unit will present literature that traces the social and cultural outcomes western expansion and "Manifest Destiny" had on Mexico and Mexicans in the U.S. Iconic Mexican American pieces of writing like Yo Soy Joaquin and The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez and historical documents like The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo will be used to focus on the geographical and political shifts between the U.S. and Mexico that led to the present.
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: CORRIDOS. Can you imagine becoming an immigrant without ever moving? It happened here, in America, in 1848. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo brought an end to border warfare between the United States and Mexico. How? Mexico ceded a huge area of land California, Nevada, Utah, part of Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico - to the U. S. The terms of the treaty stipulated that Mexican citizens could either stay where they were or return to Mexico. Imagine! Suddenly, your country changes though you haven't moved an inch. Though many of
290

the Mexicans in this situation elected to become American citizens, they did not by some stroke of magic suddenly fit. Their transition and assimilation into American culture was no smoother than other immigrant groups from abroad. During this turbulent time, Mexican-American literary voices began to be heard, but they were still very distinct from the larger American culture. The evolving literature of this community was spoken, sung, or written in Spanish. Much of the literature was in the oral tradition - it had not ever been written down but had been shared from generation to generation. At its center was personal or historical subject matter. From these traditional literatures a unique form of poetry began to flourish.
Songs and Stories: A style of ballad, called a corrido, (from the Spanish verb corer which means "to run") was a literary result of the cultural conflict between Mexican-Americans and AngloAmericans in the American Southwest. In terms of the stimulus for their development, corridos might be compared to the blues songs and poetry that were the achievements of 1920s African American culture. Corridos provided an outlet for resentment and frustration caused by discrimination and oppression, and since they were composed in Spanish, corridos could be private from the predominant "Anglo" culture. They poured out the history of the Southwest from the point-of view of the Mexican-American common man. They celebrated cultural clashes, social events, ethnic pride, violence, heroism, villainy, and adventure. One famous corrido, "The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez," told of a Mexican rancher who killed a white sheriff who was unjustly trying to arrest him. Cortez was subsequently chased by lawmen, captured and then convicted by an Anglo jury. In the ballad Cortez was described like a vaquero - expert horseman and marksman - whose adventures on the lam make for an exciting chase and confrontation with the Texas Rangers. The corrido tells how Cortez uses cunning to elude his captors, while the latter, who think only in stereotypes, are bungling and inept. The lawmen who are persecuting Cortez are described very negatively: They are "whiter than a poppy from the fear they had of Cortez and his pistol." The pejorative tone of these lyrics illustrates the tension in the Southwest. The corrido continued to enjoy popularity and remains a vital literary and musical form of expression. During the 1960s a corrido immortalized the courage and determination of Cesar Chavez and the plight of migrant workers. A famous memorial ballad "Recordando El Presidente" was written to memorialize the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Other corridos have been composed about everything from bandoleros to bullfighting, riding cars to running drugs, heroes to villains and, of course, love.
Write a two page critique on the film, "Corridos: Tales of Passion and Revolution" that addresses the following questions: 1. How do the stories in the film illustrate the cultural mores of the time? Use details examples from the various scenes to illustrate your point of view.2. Is the art of writing corridos still relevant today? Why or why not? 3. How do corridos reflect the Mexican spirit or ethnic pride? Is it shown in the film? Is it shown in the corridos we have studies? Provide clear evidence from both the film and the lyrics.
Unit 3: Creating a New Identity (Chicano Movement)
Unit Description: The impact the Mexican American experience through World War I/II and the Zoot Suit Riots had on the Chicano Movement generation will be examined to explore issues of
291

citizenship, assimilation, and cultural identity. The Chicano Movement and the rise of Chicano activists and writers who gave voice to the movement. What is generally referred to as Chicano literature is the relatively recent phenomenon which grew out of the Chicano Movement, the socio-political civil rights movement of the mid-1960s. Yet, this body of literature did not emerge from a cultural or literary vacuum, but was rather a proliferation of continuous literary activities among Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: What is the significance of I am Joaquin to the Chicano Movement of the 60's and 70's? Is the poem still relevant today? Why or why not? This lesson will broadly explore the relationship between identity and movement within the Chicano Rights Movement of the 1970s and the larger historical framework that stretches back over 500 years ago. It will center on a primary source, Corky Gonzales' I Am Joaqu�n, and its descriptions of the distinct Chicano character and the history lesson that is embedded within the text. The lesson will be broken into four parts -- each exploring a different aspect of the relationship between identity and the Chicano Movement and the Movement's relationship to historical events. Further, each activity will require students to practice different essential skills expected of high school humanities students. For example, students will be asked to read and compare two primary sources -- I Am Joaqu�n and Demands Made by East Side High School Students Listed as well as El Popol Vuh. Through this activity, students will not only explore accounts describing the Chicano identity and the objectives of the Chicano Movement, but also critically engage with primary texts, exploring their basic meanings and implications. Also, students will be given a broad lecture dealing with significant figures, organizations, and events within Mexican American history This unit, which is designed to give historical context to the primary source going all the way back to pre-Columbian cultures.
Unit Project: Students will be assigned a topic on Mexican-American history and culture referenced in Yo Soy Joaquin and conduct extensive research on the internet and the library to write a multi-paragraph essay that summarizes and synthesizes the importance of the topic in context. Students will also create a PowerPoint, Keynote presentation or a collage to present to the class as the "expert" on the topic. Students will take notes on each other's "lectures" and have an opportunity to ask questions of each other. The presentation should be least 10 slides and cite sources according to MLA format.
Unit Essay: I am Joaquin has long been touted as the beginning of Chicano literature. It has also promoted Mexican American socio and political equality, doing much to promote the Mexican American people as equals in American society, but it has also managed to largely ignore Chicanas. Explain both the shortcomings and positives of this epic piece of Chicano literature. Use two of the texts we read by Chicanas (Gloria Anzaldua, Ana Castillo, Sandra Cisneros, Dagoberta Gilb, Cherrie Moraga, Ana Nieto Gomez) to include the Chicana perspective of the movement and to critique the shortcomings of Yo Soy Joaquin.
Unit 4: Immigration and the Border
292

Unit Description: The issue of immigration and the border will be one the major themes in this unit as it relates to the socio-political, economic, and cultural reality of Mexican Americans in the U.S. The unit will focus on the territory-based rhetoric of the cultural border, boundaries and borderlands, and immigration. Critiquing the essentialist view that presumes fixed boundaries for a culture; students will explore the constructivist view that assumes an individual's choice in defining and redefining their own cultural identities in a multicultural society. This unit examines the rise of industrialism in agricultural that led to a shift in immigration policies by the U.S.; a focus will be on how migrant farmworkers and other laborers helped shape the economic reality of the Southwest. Students will take a close look at literature that speaks about the border the U.S. shares with Mexico and its constant geographical, political and cultural shifts from past to present. This unit will help students think about and discuss: What is the purpose of a border (physical and otherwise)? Who creates borders and who are they created on? How do Mexican Americans/Chicana/os resist borders and how is this reflected in the literature?
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: Students will explore and create definitions of the word "border." Students will engage in a multi-perspective way of looking at the border.
Part 1--Individual Writing.
Students free write their responses to the questions: 1) What is a border? 2) What words come to mind when you hear the word "border"? (no matter how irrelevant or off-the-wall the word or thought is, write it down); 3) What borders have you crossed in your life? 4) What borders do you not cross?
Part 2--Group Discussion
Students gather in groups of three or four, share responses, then work together to write up and illustrate their own definitions and lists of types of borders. Each group presents their ideas to the class.
Part 3--Class Discussion.
How many different kinds of borders can we list using what the groups have written? (Also, can discuss questions #3 and #4 from Part 1.) Examples:
Border as Wall or Fence Border as a Membrane, Skin, Porous Border as Meeting Place, Interaction Border as Marketplace, Goods & Services
Border Between Groups of People, Languages, Economies Border Between Ways of Life, Cultures, ("Ecosystems") Border as Edge, Fuzzy or Crisp, Rules, Inside/Outside, Etc.
293

Border as Psychological, Physical, Social, etc. Question for discussion: Can a border function in more than one way? Why or why not?
Part 4--Listening & Responding.
Students read quotes/passages from writings about the border. Students can either respond to the quotes or create their own statements/poems on the idea of "borders."
Starter line: "The border is..."
Sample statements:
"For Mexico, the border is not that rigid Puritan thing, a line; straight lines are unknown in Mexico. The border, like everything else, is subject to supply and demand. The border is a revolving door." --Richard Rodriguez
"The border is transient...the border is a word game...the border is a virtual cesspool"--Atlantic Monthly
"Tijuana has more in common with Santiago, Chil� than San Diego, California." -- Jorge Bustamante, President, El Colegio de la Frontera Norte
"This is the only place I know where you can jump from the First World to the Third World in five minutes." --Julio Chiu, El Paso bank executive and native of Cd. Ju�rez
"We have people here who have never heard of the word 'environment' or 'ecosystem.' It's as if you were talking in another language." --Naachiely Lopez, Tijuana environmentalist, 1992
"Many Mexicans think of the move from Cd. Ju�rez across the Rio Grande more like moving to a richer neighborhood than going to another country." �Washington Post, 1978
Source: La Frontera/The Border: An Enigma for Two Nations. University of Southern California, 1993.
Closure: Students can read aloud a favorite line or phrase from their writings and as a class revise order of lines to create a group poem/writing on the border.
Unit Essay: An essay exploring the various ways the border functions. Consider the questions: What would the region be like if there were no border? What has the border done to the region? To the people? Consider indigenous peoples of the area (particularly in Arizona) who have lived here for over 500 years and say there is no border. How can anyone say that there is no border?
294

Unit Research Paper: Before finishing this assignment, you will have read Anzuld�a, and Rodriguez' personal experiences of the border. For this assignment, you will be writing your own autobiography in which you address three specific ways in which your individual life connects to the national life. You will be writing your autobiography (or the story of your family) as the story of your people (however you define your people). In the end, you will explain how a few incidents from your own life made you more aware of the possibilities or limitations of connection to the national life of the mythical "America." The three essential parts of this assignment are:
Part 1: What were some of the earliest experiences you had in which you felt included as part of a larger nation? This could be the pledge of allegiance you said in school, or visiting a national monument, or reading through your American history book, or hearing your relatives tell you stories about war, labor struggles, and past American figures. Focus on a scene or two that you remember and describe what made that scene so memorable.
Part 2: What were some of the times that you felt excluded from being part of the larger nation? What happened? Did you realize at the time that you were being excluded, or is it only in looking back that you figured it out? This event need not even be something that happened directly to you -- it could be something you heard happening to someone else -- but it should be an event that had some consequence in your life.
Part 3: How do you make sense of both being included and being excluded from your idea of what "America" means? Do you now claim your identity as one of many American lives? Do you continue to feel that you are cut off from the early image of "America" that you had? How do you reconcile the incidents from Part 1 and Part 2? Or, if you can't reconcile them, which of the incidents has impacted your identity the most and shaped how you see yourself today?
FORM: Your autobiography will be in the form of a personal essay. It must be between at least 3 full pages and no longer than 6 pages. You must discuss the three parts above, but you can do them in any order you wish (as long as I can see clearly that you have some sort of organization to your thoughts). One way you might want to consider organizing this essay would be based on the following structure:
I: Title (think of something creative)
II: A one-paragraph introduction that begins with something attention grabbing and ends with a thesis statement that quickly answers Part 3 above)
III: One or two paragraphs that describe the experience mentioned in Part 1.
IV: One or two paragraphs that describe of the experience mentioned in Part 2 (these paragraphs should take the form of paragraphs before them)
V: One paragraph that clearly identifies the conflict between Parts 1 and 2
295

VI: One or two paragraphs that explains the answer to the questions in Part III
VIII: A concluding paragraph that reinforces the one sentence summary of Part III and explains why it is significant to the literature we are reading in this class.
Unit 5: Colonization of Latin America
Unit Description: This course will put Latino and Latina literature in context to the larger literary canon. We will explore important aspects of the works through a mostly historical approach focusing on the impact of colonialism on Latin American culture but will also draw from other components including folklore, memory, social issues, and cultural identity. A broad overview will be given to Latin America as a whole and through the literature, students will examine the influence of Spanish and Portuguese colonial rule on Latin America, as well as the modern day influences of Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Central America, and South America on American and Latino identity in the U.S. The primary text is "The Vintage Book of Latin American Stories" edited by Carlos Fuentes and Julio Ortega which will be used for the rest of the semester in conjunction with other texts.
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: Cultural Diffusion and Latin America A look at colonization, the Atlantic slave trade, and the Columbian Exchange, its impacts on the culture of Latin America, and the positive/negative impacts of this cultural diffusion. Write an essay that discusses the literature, art and music that resulted from the encounters of many backgrounds on the stage of colonial Latin America. How did the experience of colonization affect Latin American cultures? How were people of all backgrounds in colonial Latin America able to express themselves? What flavors did their identities add to their cultural expressions? What does the art/literature of particular groups say about their worldview or place in society? Use the literature we have read as evidence in your responses.
Unit Project: Immigration has been a part of the world since humans first started walking. This phenomenon continues for a variety of reasons today. The U.S. borders Mexico and we have many immigrants from Mexico and Central America. Their reasons for immigrating are many and not always presented by the media in the best light. Students need to know the various reasons that so many Latin Americans are leaving their countries and coming to the U.S. One way to find this information is to gather it through interviews and oral history. Students will be studying immigration from Latin American countries and the statistics that are known, using the Internet and written material. A foundation will be built around understanding the impact of immigration on the U.S. as well as on Latin-American countries. At the same time students will conduct an interview of a local immigrant(s) in order to have a personal view of the issues that surround immigration. Students will write a detailed essay (minimum 3 pages) about the person you interviewed as well as formal presentation of the information that you found and share it with the class.
296

Presentation Choices: This will allow students to synthesize the information gathered and respond to a critical issue in our world today. You will present your presentation to the class.
1. PowerPoint presentation. You must have at least 10 slides in your presentation and it must be thorough.
2. Create an "album" containing facts, stories, poetry, drawings, songs of the person you interviewed and the information you gathered.
3. A video production for public access TV in the form of a newscast or documentary.
Unit 6: The Rise of Magical Realism
Unit Description: A look at the rise of Latino/a writers, artists, filmmakers, and others who have become more accepted by the mainstream of U.S. society and the world and yet still retain their cultural identity or are re-shaping that identity. This unit will put Latino and Latina literature in context to the larger literary canon. We will explore important aspects of the works through a mostly historical approach focusing on the impact of colonialism on Latin American culture but will also draw from other components including folklore, memory, social issues, and cultural identity. A focus on the rise of new cultural identity that rejects the old "colonial" styles of literature for fresh approach to writing that saw the rise of Surrealism, Magical Realism, and eventually a hybrid approach to literature in the U.S. by Latino/a writers who are simultaneously part of the mainstream American culture but also redefining what it means to be American.
Unit Assignment(s)
Key Assignment: Theme of Isolation
"The Handsomest Drowned Man in the World" explores the ways in which human beings overcome personal isolation through their collective community. In this story, common beliefs in the mythic or fantastic bring together the members of a small fishing village. The men, women, and children of this community are united by their common desire for self-improvement. Together, they imagine a better future for themselves, a future in which they are as extraordinary as the myths in which they all believe.
Questions about Isolation
1. Does the drowned man create conflict in the village, or bring the village together? (Your answer might change depending on which part of the story you're examining.)
2. How does the village's relative isolation from neighboring towns affect the way we read the story?
297

3. Why is it so important to the women of the village that they claim the drowned man as their own?
Course Final Essay
From the following prompts, please choose ONE. For each of the writing prompts, students will incorporate critical readings that could best be applied to the arguments/stance/perspective the student is making in the essay. Students are required to use at least one critical reading.

Course Content
Unit 1: Intro to the Study of Mexican-American History
Unit Summary: Coverage will include an introduction of the themes and overview of MexicanAmerican history. The course will begin by exploring what the following key terms mean; Mexican, American, Mexican-American, Chicana/o, Metizo/a, Latino, Hispanic, ethnicity, and nationality. Students will discuss the concept of identity and define what it means to them and how they view themselves. They will also analyze case studies of school districts across that United States that have offered Mexican-American history and identify arguments for whether or not schools should adopt Mexican-American history courses to the curriculum. Students will specifically learn about the Mexican American studies program that was contested in Arizona by residents who consider these courses to be threatening. They will also learn how the MexicanAmerican community and proponents of the course responded to the ban of Mexican-American studies in Arizona high school districts. Students will engage in discussions including Socratic Seminars and Structured Academic Controversies to explore issues of politics, identity, resistance and education as they relate to the teaching of Mexican-American history. Students will be exposed to historical thinking skills such as identifying the differences between primary and secondary sources. Students will read and evaluate the sources as they analyze the audience and potential bias of each source to formulate their own critical perspectives about the teaching and field of Mexican-American history.
Major Assignment: Write a letter addressed to a student, teacher, or legislature involved in the banning of Mexican-American Studies in Tucson, Arizona in 2010. Students write a typed response communicating their argument in favor of or against the teaching of MexicanAmerican Studies. Students learn how to analyze primary and secondary sources to formulate and defend their perspective by using evidence to support their opinions as well as comparing and contrasting views with divergent opinions.
Unit 2: Origins of the Mexican-American Community
Unit Summary: Students will examine the causes and effects of the Spanish conquest and the Mexican-American War. Students will explore the encounter and interactions between Europeans and the Aztecs and identify and analyze the impact of the social, political and religious institutions that were introduced in the Americas. As students explore these events, students will discuss westward expansion, specifically focusing on the conflicts in the southwest and California to analyze the political, social and economic conditions of the historical events that led to the formation of the Mexican-American culture in the United States. Throughout the unit, students will discuss the role of religion, gender and race relations in order to understand how Mexican-American culture was shaped in different parts of the United States. There will be a focus on California missions, historic landmarks of the Spanish/Mexican colonial period in
301

California so that students could trace the roots/origins of the Mexican community and its contributions during the late 1800s and 1900s.
Major Assignment: Create a history exhibit outlining the social, political and economic causes and effects of the Spanish conquest and the Mexican American War and analyze how these events shaped Mexican-American culture in various parts of the United States, including California. Students will organize their information on a trifold presentation board where they will learn to trace the origins of the Mexican-American community as they relate to the life of Mexican-Americans both in the past and in the present. Students will include visuals and artifacts to represent the events and prepare an oral presentation to be shared with their peers.
Unit 3: Immigration
Unit Summary: Students examine the reasons why immigrants moved from Mexico to the United States in the last one hundred years and identify how Americans responded to each wave of immigration from 1910 to the 1930s. Students compare and contrast reasons why people have immigrated in the past and the restrictions the U.S. has placed then and today according to the political, social, economic and cultural conditions of each historical time period. The unit focuses on three major time periods, the Mexican Revolution, World War I(WWI) and the Great Depression. For the Mexican Revolution, students will analyze the effects of the Mexican Revolution on its rural poor and on the U.S. in terms of immigration. They will evaluate the rule of Porfirio Diaz and analyze immigration data under his presidency. During the study of WWI, students will analyze the relationship between a nation's economy (good or bad) and how the nation treats their immigration. Students will continue to analyze this connection as students read and research about the lives of American citizens that were deported as part of the Repatriation Movement during the Great Depression. Students think critically and assess the impact of these events, in relation to the larger goals of examining the push and pull factors of immigration and how Americans responded by engaging in Socratic seminars, inquiries, debates and simulations. Students accomplish this by analyzing a variety of images created during each time period such as political cartoons and photographs. They will also read newspaper articles and textbook excerpt to understand the significance of time and place in shaping immigrants' decisions to move to the United States and shaping the beliefs that Americans had about immigration.
Major Assignment: Write a research paper that answers the following research questions: 1) How have economic and other conditions in the U.S. and Mexico impacted immigration for the past 100 years? 2) How have Americans responded to Mexican immigrants over the past century? Students use on-line data bases and class libraries to research and analyze primary and secondary sources in order to identify the political, social and economic conditions and push/pull factors that have impacted immigration and use historical sources to form an argument regarding how Americans have responded to Mexican immigrants over the last 100 years. Students specifically analyze events such as the Mexican Revolution, WWI and the Great Depression and compare and contrast different perspectives and responses to immigration depending on the time period and national context of each event.

Unit 4: Mexican-Americans during WWII
Unit Summary: Students will analyze and examine the roles that Mexicans and MexicanAmericans played during the WWII era and evaluate the racial/ethnic tensions that existed during this time period both abroad and in the United States. Students will also identify and research Mexican-Americans that served in the armed forces and the contributions that Mexican-American men and women made to the war effort. Students will learn about MexicanAmerican Congressional Medal of Honor recipients, Jose M. Lopez and Guy Luis Abandon by researching their lives. They will connect how their lives served as a precursor and inspiration to the Chicano/ Civil Rights Movement. Students will be exposed to the emergence of new Latino civil rights organizations such as Community Service Organization (CSO), the G.I Forum and League of United Latin-American citizens, (L.U.L.A.C) that were created with the goals of seeking greater equal political treatment. Students will also explain the foreign relation policy between Mexico and U.S. in the context of the war. They will be able to explain why the Bracero Program started, who was responsible for recruiting the workers and the legacy of the Bracero Program. Students will then create a document based argument about whether the Bracero Program was a form of exploitation of or an opportunity for Mexican laborers. Students will also discuss the implications that the war had on the labor force and geographically examine why Mexican-Americans moved from rural areas to the cities by analyzing maps of the 1940's. In addition, students will also analyze the Zoot Suit Riots and zoot suit culture in order to shed light and discuss issues such as the role of the media, class, race, ethnicity and gender as they related to the life on the home front during WWII.
Major Assignment: Create a newspaper that features articles on how the political and other conditions impacted the lives of Mexican and Mexican-Americans during WWII. Students will put themselves in the shoes of a journalist reporting on events during the 1940's. Articles will include major events such as the Zoot Suit riots where students will have to report on the root cause of the Zoot Suit riots by analyzing and citing various primary and secondary sources to support their argument. Students will also include visuals and create advertisements as they place themselves within the historical context of the time period. Students will learn how the lives of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans were affected during the WWII era and will learn the impact of historical context on the way that events and ideas unfold.
Unit 5: The Chicano Movement
Unit Summary: Students will analyze and examine the Chicano movement of the 1960's and 1970's. They will identify demands for equity and civil rights in the realms of education, labor, art and politics. Students will explore the causes of the movement by conducting on-line and library research about organization and individuals that took part in each of the movements. For each realm, students will identify the historical conditions that led to the movement and important groups and people that affected social change. For example, students will learn about the farm working conditions that caused labor activists such as Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez to form the United Farm Workers (UFW) union to protest and fight for their rights. In addition, students will explore the relationship between Braceros and the UFW by engaging in a
303

Structured Academic Controversy in which students will come to consensus about whether or not the UFW was an anti-immigrant movement and support their argument using evidence. Students will continue to explore ways to protest as they learn about the student movement and how art was used to make political and social statements. Students will listen to oral histories and listen to guest speakers who were part of the Chicano movement. By researching the efforts of groups and individuals, students will be able to synthesize the information gathered from both primary and secondary sources and analyze both the successes and or setbacks of the movement and its implications on the issues that affect the Latino community today.
Major Assignment: Multimedia Project Presentation, where students will have the option of presenting their research findings about an aspect of Chicano Movement such as Education, Labor, Art, or Politics. Students will build technological literacy by organizing their information in a Prezi or PowerPoint. The presentation will also include an oral and written component (research paper) that students will share with their peers and family members in the form of a student led exhibition. Students will learn to synthesize and corroborate information from various sources to defend a thesis on whether the movement was successful or not in a specific realm (art, students, farm workers) of the broader Chicano Movement.
Unit 6: Current Movements in the Latino Community Today
Unit Summary: Students will identify and analyze challenges and issues facing the Latino community today. Students will analyze and interpret data from recent research polls in order to identify the top issues that are relevant to the Latino community such as education, immigration, jobs and the economy and health care. For example, students will learn about contemporary immigration and examine a case study of the Iowa raids and deportations that occurred in 2006. They will also research immigration laws that have been passed in Alabama and Arizona in order to analyze the laws and their impact on the Latino community and the broader United States. Students will also learn and analyze the political, social and economic implications of federal legislation such as NAFTA, the DREAM Act and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Students will explore current day movements revolving around these issues by reading primary and secondary sources. As students learn about current events, they will compare and contrast the issues of today as they relate to the events and trends of historical events that we have studied in the previous units.
Major Assignment: Create a documentary where students will survey and interview community members about issues affecting the Latino community. Students will use the resources of the digital media lab including iPads and computers to conduct on-line research and record oral histories. They will apply technology skills and learn how to conduct interviews to synthesize current events with Mexican-American history of the past.

Unit 8: Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR)
Students will take what they learned in Units 1-7 to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem in the Asian American community. This YPAR project has a guided process that allows the students to use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they studied.
Unit 1: An Introduction to Asian American History (4 weeks)
Semester 1 Asian American History. Students will be introduced to the concepts of historical problems and perspective that are central to understanding Asian American experiences in the United States. The semester begins with an examination of how Asian Americans have been, or have not been portrayed by American historians. Students will start with an American history textbook analysis with the book that was adopted by their school district. They will also be reading several essays that introduce the centrality of racism, immigration, and identity in Asian American Studies. They end this unit by exploring what it means to be Asian American.
Unit 2: Asian American Immigration and Diaspora (7 weeks)
Students will review or learn how to read and analyze primary sources through the exploration of Asian American Migration. They will look at primary documents that set up the context--both in Asia and in the United States--for Asian immigration to the United States. They will also be reading the autobiographical novel, America is the Heart by Carlos Bulosan, a story about an early Filipino immigrant who came to the United States to escape poverty.
Unit 3: Asian American Settlement and Exclusion (5 weeks)
307

Students will go beyond the reasons of Asian American immigration and explore the concept of exclusion. The focus is on the main exclusionary efforts that have limited the immigration, settlement, and pursuit of equity of Asian Americans. Students will look at exclusionary policies, statements that have negatively impacted the experiences and identity of Asian Americans. This unit also explores Asian resistance efforts. Students will be doing group interviews with Asian Americans who are experts on historical exclusionary policies. These experts will either be people who have had family members who were directly affected or those who have studied Asian American exclusion.
Unit 4: Peer Teaching Project (3 weeks)
Students will be taking what they learned in their first semester (Units 1-3) to develop a lesson plan on a specific topic within Asian American history. They will teach the lesson plan to a nearby middle or elementary school. They will be taught how to do the research to develop a well-structured lesson plan with interactive exercises that will engage the students in the class that they are teaching in. The lesson plan must draw from the concepts presented in Units 1-3. This becomes that major assessment for semester 1.
Unit 5: On Becoming an Asian American Community Prior to 1965 (4 weeks)
Semester 2: Asian American Communities. Students will explore the concept of community focusing primarily the Asian American communities that have been formed before 1965. The focus is on the interracial and interethnic relationships that formed. Students will look at antimiscegenation laws and practices that shaped the treatment of Asian Americans in the United States. They will also learn about the alliances and resistance of Asian Americans toward antiAsian violence.
Unit 6: New Asian American Communities after 1965 (3 weeks)
Students will return to the concept of community focusing primarily the Asian American communities that have been formed after the Immigration and Reform Act of 1965. They will look at the original policy signed by Lyndon B. Johnson. They will look at the political context with regard to the social movements that preceded the policy and the main intent of the good will act. They will also look at the immigration trends that show the impact of the law. The focus is to create an immigration timeline and find themselves/their families in history, regardless if they are Asian American or not. Building on their interview skills they learned in the first semester, they will be writing an oral history paper with an Asian American who has immigrated after 1965. Students will also construct a presentation based on the oral history to share with the class about how the policy has impacted individual experiences, spawned the growth of the Asian American community and how it has changed the face of the United States.
Unit 7: Asian American Social Movements (5 weeks)
308

Students will learn about the Asian American activism to explore the ways that they have resisted injustice. Through essays and images, this unit looks at the following social movements: San Francisco International Hotel Anti-Eviction Movement, Third World Liberation Front Movement, and Vincent Chin Anti-scapegoating Movement. Students will explore how each movement is rooted in a central problem that the Asian American community was facing. Students will also be studying the praxis of each of the movements to prepare for the Youth Participatory Action Research projects that they will do in their final unit.
Unit 8: Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) (7 weeks)
Youth Participatory Action Research provides young people with opportunities to study social problems affecting their lives and then determine actions to rectify these problems. (Dimitriadis 2008). Students will take what they learned in Units 1-7 to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem in the Asian American community. This YPAR project has a guided process that allows the students then use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they have studied. The following shows how each term in YPAR is operationalized. YOUTH: Young people between the ages of 14 and 24.
PARTICIPATORY: All participants, including youth, are seen as experts who all have important experiences and knowledge.
ACTION: The goal is to use what youth research to develop a plan of action toward bettering their communities.
RESEARCH: A systematic investigation of a problem facing youth.
This course implements culturally and community responsive pedagogy by focusing on Asian American histories that are often neglected in mainstream history courses and connecting them to community issues that need to be addressed. Gay (2000) defines culturally responsive teaching as using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them; it teaches to and through the strengths of these students. Gay (2000) also describes culturally responsive teaching as having these characteristics: Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Course Implementation It acknowledges the legitimacy of the cultural heritages of different ethnic groups, both as legacies that affect students' dispositions, attitudes, and approaches to learning and as worthy content to be taught in the formal curriculum. This course looks at the diversity amongst Asian Americans but also the collective experiences impacted by racism. This is evidenced to the use of primary sources. It builds bridges of meaningfulness between home and school experiences as well as between academic abstractions and lived sociocultural realities.
Unit 6- Oral History Project. It uses a wide variety of instructional strategies that are connected to different learning styles. Units 1-7 It teaches students to know and praise their own and each others' cultural heritages. Unit 1- Cultural Document Box and Personal Timeline Unit 6- Oral

History Project Sharing It incorporates multicultural information, resources, and materials in all the subjects and skills routinely taught in schools. The focus of this course is really about looking at history with an Asian American perspective.
Unit 8 Continued: Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) (7 weeks)
*http://www.intime.uni.edu/multiculture/curriculum/culture/teaching.htm
This course utilizes an ethnic studies framework based on the goal of deepening students' understanding of both the past and the present through continual reflection on the interaction between the two. Students learn to shift analytical lenses between their personal lives and the larger social and historical context that has created the environment within which they live. This process deepens students' understanding of themselves by grounding it in history and it deepens their appreciation of history by connecting it to their contemporary lives.
This dynamic is demonstrated with a specific focus on Asian Americans. Each unit was constructed as building upon the previous unit. Each unit draws from primary documents, students' personal experiences, community and/or family members' experiences, and scholarly essays. Each of these sources come together to value knowledge that goes beyond what is published in history text books.
The culminating project for the course also requires students to employ both their personal, contemporary analytical lens and their historical analytical lens. Students work in teams to develop lessons based on the content of their Ethnic Studies course and teach the lessons to students at middle and/or elementary schools in their communities. Lesson development emphasizes the connections that the high school students must find between the historical material and the lives of the middle school students in order to assure the success of the lessons. Student writing is the principal form of assessment in this course. Short in-class or homework writing assignments provide formative assessment of daily activities, and the collection of writing assignments outlined above provides a summative assessment for each unit.
In addition, oral presentations are used to assess student learning, as in Unit 1 (sharing the document box), Unit 3 (performance of a five-minute play), Unit 4 (teaching project), Unit 6 (oral history project). Most units include a project by which student work is assessed. Unit 4 features a teaching project. Students will be taking what they learned in the first semester (Units 1-3) and develop a lesson plan on a specific topic within Asian American history. They will teach the lesson plan to a nearby middle or elementary school. They will be taught how to do the research to develop a well-structured lesson plan with interactive exercises that will engage the students in the class that they are teaching in. The lesson plan must draw from the concepts presented in Units 1-3. This becomes that major assessment for semester 1.
Ultimately, the main assessment will be the outcome of the Youth Participatory Action Research Project where both writing and oral skills will be tested. Students will take what they learned in

Course Content
Lesson 1: Worldviews and Paradigms
In this lesson, students will study two ways of thinking: Reductionism and Holism. They will understand the effects of secularism on Native American and non-Native American interactions. The lesson also describes the different ways in which the Native Americans and the Westerners live together as a family, share wealth, and interact with the natural environment.
Activity: In this activity, students will define secularism and describe the role of secularism in Native American and non-Native interactions. Students have to answer questions on the influence of secularism on Native American and non-Native paradigms and explain the differences that influenced Native American and non-Native interactions. They have to answer these questions in a well-developed paragraph, in seven to nine sentences, using correct grammar and cite specific examples to support their ideas.
Lesson 2: Spirituality
This lesson introduces students to the unifying characteristics of Native American spirituality and the sacred items and symbols used by them in their traditional practices. This lesson also explains how the habits, outward appearances, lifestyles, and beliefs of the Europeans affected the Native Americans and vice versa. It briefly discusses how the Native American tribes, under the U.S. government, were initially denied the right to practice certain religious ceremonies, but later, activism and legislation paved way for more freedom.
Activity: In this lesson, the activity is divided into two parts. In the first part, students will answer questions in two or three sentences, regarding the primary difference between the Civilization Regulations of 1880 and the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (AIRFA) of 1978. They will also have to explain the difference between animism, monotheism, and polytheism. In the second part, students have to write a paragraph consisting of seven to nine sentences, explaining the differences between traditional Native American spiritual beliefs and Western practices.
Lesson 3: Language
This lesson describes the importance of oral tradition in Native American communities, and traces the development of their written languages. Students will learn to identify the influence of Native American languages on English, which is spoken in the United States. They will also

Finally, students will also explain the effects of diseases from Europe on the Native American populations.
Lesson 5: Contemporary Health Issues
This lesson introduces students to the healthcare coverage that the government provides, and describes how personal beliefs and experiences influence the use of health services and traditional medicine. Students will also gain a basic understanding of the primary differences between Native American health statistics and those of the general population. This lesson briefly explains the development of the Indian Health Service, which strives to deliver healthcare services that incorporate indigenous beliefs and customs along with modern practices.
Activity: In this activity, students will answer two open-ended questions in a well-developed paragraph. The questions will be based on the distrust that the Native American people have on the Indian Health Service or other public health services. Students also have to explain the term "culturally acceptable" and its relation to contemporary Native American health care.
Lesson 6: Contemporary Social Issues
This lesson focuses on the various social issues faced by the Native American society. Students will interpret statistics, graphs, and charts, and analyze the causes and theories related to the social status of Native Americans.

They will learn how mentors, clubs, and community organizations empower youth with protective factors to avoid teen violence.
319

Activity: In this activity, students will answer questions, in a well-developed paragraph of seven to nine sentences, with specific examples to support their answer. They will answer questions on the differences between tribal colleges and the federal boarding schools of the past. Students will also answer a scenario-based question where they have to imagine themselves starting a club or an organization to foster protective factors for teens and youth. Here, they have to mention what activities or services their club would offer.
Lesson 7: Contemporary Economic Issues
This lesson begins by discussing the various economic issues faced by the Native American society. Students will learn how the tribal communities, in spite of their overall improvement, lag behind U.S. averages in terms of income and employment. This lesson also explains the policy of self-determination, which has allowed Native Americans to make decisions and control the programs that operate in their own communities.
Activity: In this activity, students will answer questions, in a well-developed paragraph of seven to nine sentences, by citing specific examples to support their ideas. They will mention the factors that contributed to the differences in the median income for various ethnic groups.

Getting students to engage primary sources, develop youth-participatory action research (Youth-led Participatory Action Research (YPAR) projects, or create service-learning projects are just a few examples of how an inquiry-based approach encourages students to become engaged actors within the learning process. Youth Participatory Action Research provides young people with opportunities to study social problems affecting their lives and then determine actions to rectify these problems. (Dimitriadis 2008). Students will take what they learned in earlier units to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem identified, for its culminating unit. This YPAR project has a guided process that allows the students then to use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they have studied.

A course can utilize an ethnic studies framework based on the goal of deepening students' understanding of both the past and the present through continual reflection on the interaction between the two. Students learn to shift analytical lenses between their personal lives and the larger social and historical context that has created the environment within which they live. This process deepens students' understanding of themselves by grounding it in history and it deepens their appreciation of history by connecting it to their contemporary lives.

This dynamic can be demonstrated with a specific focus on a particular subgroup, such as Asian Americans. Each unit is constructed to build upon the previous unit. Each unit draws from primary documents, students' personal experiences, community and/or family members' experiences, and scholarly essays. Each of these sources come together to value knowledge that goes beyond what is published in history textbooks.
The culminating project for the course also requires students to employ both their personal, contemporary analytical lens and their historical analytical lens. Students work in teams to develop lessons based on the content of their Ethnic Studies course and teach the lessons to students at middle and/or elementary schools in their communities. Lesson development emphasizes the connections that the high school students must find between the historical material and the lives of the middle school students in order to assure the success of the lessons. Student writing is the principal form of assessment in this course. Short in-class or homework writing assignments provide formative assessment of daily activities, and the collection of writing assignments outlined above provides a summative assessment for each unit.
In addition, oral presentations are used to assess student learning, as in Unit 1 (sharing the document box), Unit 3 (performance of a five-minute play), Unit 4 (teaching project), Unit 6 (oral history project). Most units include a project by which student work is assessed. Unit 4 features a teaching project. Students should be taking what they learned in the first semester (Units 1-3) and develop a lesson plan on a specific topic within the subgroup focus. They will teach the lesson plan to a nearby middle or elementary school. They will be taught how to do the research to develop a well-structured lesson plan with interactive exercises that will engage the students in the class that they are teaching in. The lesson plan must draw from the concepts presented in Units 1-3. This becomes that major assessment for semester 1.
Ultimately, the main assessment will be the outcome of the Youth Participatory Action Research Project where both writing and oral skills will be tested. Students will take what they learned in Units 1-7 to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem in the identified subgroup community. This YPAR project has a
338

guided process that allows the students then use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they studied. The writing assignments described below are produced through a writer's workshop process that includes structured brainstorming activities, multiple drafts, peer editing, and publication within the classroom or school.
The following shows how each term in YPAR is operationalized.
YOUTH: Young people between the ages of 14 and 24.
PARTICIPATORY: All participants, including youth, are seen as experts who all have important experiences and knowledge.
ACTION: The goal is to use what youth research to develop a plan of action toward bettering their communities.
RESEARCH: A systematic investigation of a problem facing youth.
This course implements culturally and community responsive pedagogy by focusing on marginalized histories that are often neglected in mainstream history courses and connecting them to community issues that need to be addressed. Gay (2000) defines culturally responsive teaching as using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them; it teaches to and through the strengths of these students. Gay (2000) also describes culturally responsive teaching as having these characteristics:
Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Course Implementation:
 It acknowledges the legitimacy of the cultural heritages of different ethnic groups, both as legacies that affect students' dispositions, attitudes, and approaches to learning and as worthy content to be taught in the formal curriculum.
 The course would look at the diversity amongst one marginalized subgroup but also the collective experiences impacted by racism. This is evidenced to the use of primary sources.

 It builds bridges of meaningfulness between home and school experiences as well as between academic abstractions and lived sociocultural realities
Sample Lesson 1: Migration Stories and Oral History Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 6 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a Lesson Purpose and Overview: As part of a larger unit on migration, this lesson guides students to explore their personal stories around how migration and discrimination has impacted their families. The students will learn about how their own family's migration stories connect to their local history. Key Terms and Concepts: oral history, migration, interviewing, archive, memory Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Conduct oral history interviews, transcribe narratives, develop research questions, and build upon interpersonal communication skills
2. Learn from each other by being exposed to the unique migration stories of their peers
340

3. Strengthen their public speaking skills through interviewing and presenting their research findings.

3.4.

Students may also use information to examine their own community and

see how existing attitudes and institutions could be changed to improve the lives

of newcomers and ensure acceptance.

Essential Questions:

1. How does your family's story connect to your local history?

1.2.

How can you and your peers influence and change community

organizations, attitudes and institutions to improve the lives of newcomers to the

community?

Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. Develop a PowerPoint presentation for the lesson opening that highlights several major waves of migration (both voluntary and forced). The slides should also include data on migration to the local community and racial and ethnic demographics.

2. Introduce the oral history project to the students by letting them know that they will have an opportunity to learn more about their family's and community's migration histories. Task each student with interviewing one family member (preferably an elder) and one community member. The interviews will focus on the interviewee's migration stories, childhood, and memory of the city. The interviews should also seek opinions on how changes in policy, institutions, and community attitudes could (have) improve(d) the interviewee's experience.You may want to show a clip of an interview from a digital oral history archive (see recommended sources for examples) to provide students an example. Teachers should be sensitive to varying family dynamics and have alternative assignments or activities for students that may have difficulty identifying a family member.

341

3. After introducing the project, provide an overview of the mechanics of oral history. Discuss the types of equipment and materials students will need (an audio or video recording device or application, and field notebook); help students come up with questions, discussing the differences between closed and openended questions; and begins to introduce transcribing.
4. During the next few class sessions, allow students to engage in peerinterviewing. Students should conduct mini oral history interviews (no more than seven to ten minutes) with each other. After each interview, give students time to reflect on the interviewing process, what they learned, memory, and storytelling. Using the "think, pair, share" method, have students write their own reactions to the interviewing process on a sheet of paper, then have them share it with a peer, and finally to the larger class.
 If students have access to headsets and computers in the classroom or nearby, they can use the remaining time to practice transcribing their mini-oral history interviews. After two to three mock oral history interviews with their peers, students should be prepared to carry out their own full interviews with a family elder and community member.
5. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a thirty-minute oral history interview with their interviewees, and transcribe at least one interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for copies of old pictures, images of relics that hold some significant meaning or value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.
6. After completing the interview and transcribing, students take excerpts from the interview, as well as pictures or other primary sources they may have from their interviewee, and create a three to five minute presentation (either a video, PowerPoint, Prezi, or poster board) discussing their interviewee's migration story, connection to the city, and a brief reflection on their experience conducting the interview. Students are allotted three days to work on their
342

presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an opportunity to practice their presentations with peer to peer and peer to small group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.
7. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations, students in the audience should be active listeners, taking notes, and asking follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using "the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.
8. As part of the culmination of this project, using these guiding questions students make the broader connection of all migration stories represented in the classroom.
 How are our migration stories similar?
 How are they different?
 How does knowing the shared migration stories of your peers impact how we relate to one another?
 What changes are needed to improve the lives of the people who are new to the community? How can these be accomplished?
9. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by coordinating a community presentation event.
10. Students may also use information to examine their own community and develop an action project to change existing attitudes and institutions to improve the lives of newcomers and ensure acceptance. Students apply strategies of civic action:
343

1. Students research and analyze the root causes of the problem they want to address.

2. Students determine a viable goal for their action project after analyzing the pro and con arguments of a number of options.

3. Students analyze the involvement of various stakeholders, including the power they have to influence policy, and the level of interests in bringing about the needed changes.

4. Students develop strategies and concrete plans to engage, persuade or influence various identified stakeholders, including compelling arguments and evidence for needed social and policy changes.

9.5.

Students apply tools of civic engagement to implement the

strategies and plans they developed

Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Peer assessments are used to help students refine their oral history presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the practice groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having difficulty with the assignment.
 During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students' presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.
 Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student presenters.
 Teachers and students may evaluate the applicationeffectiveness of the student applied knowledge to inform their endeavors/actions in bringing about change, with realistic understanding of and patience for broader social impact.

This primary source analysis assignment turns students into researchers, while simultaneously allowing the students to orient themselves with the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement, and contemporary social movements.
The purpose of the lesson is for students to learn, analyze and discuss current social movements happening both in the United States and abroad. By learning about past and present social movements students will learn first-hand how communities of color have resisted and fought for their human rights and self-determination.
Key Terms and Concepts: social movement, The Third World Liberation Front, solidarity
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Conduct a primary source analysis in relation to social movements and the development of ethnic studies
2. Consider how social movements emerge, understand tactics employed, and identify their overall contributions/impact to society
3. Engage in critical analysis, learn to decipher credible and non-credible sources, further develop public speaking skills, and work collaboratively
Essential Questions:
1. What causes social movements?
2. What strategies and tactics are most effective within social movements? What gives rise to the proposals and demands of social movements?
3. What impact have past and present social movements had on society? Why might people have different responses to social movements? What social movements exist today?
346

3.4. What makes social movements successful? What other strategies should be adopted to complement and enhance social movements to increase impact?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Begin the lesson by defining what social movements are and how they start. Introduce the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement and the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike to students. Include in the introduction/overview pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting. Throughout the overview, highlight that the Ethnic Studies Movement was successful due to unity and solidarity building, as well as drawing on momentum from other movements that were happening simultaneously, like, the Black Power, American Indian, Anti-war, Asian American, Chicano, United Farm Workers, and Women's Liberation movements.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework includes an extensive section on the Civil Rights Movement and other movements that fought for social change (beginning on page 414). As part of their research for this ethnic studies lesson, teachers may also ask students to reflect upon past movements and how these modern-day social movements build upon the accomplishments and limitations of those who came before.
2. Divide students into pairs, providing each group with two primary source documents including:
a. The original demands of the TWLF
b. Student proposals for Black, Asian American, Chicano, and Native American studies
c. Images from the strike
d. Speeches and correspondence written by San Francisco State College administrators concerning the TWLF strike
347

e. Student and Black Panther Party newspaper clippings featuring articles about the TWLF strike
3. Introduce each of the materials, providing a small amount of context, and a brief overview of what is a primary source. Instruct each pair to read each document carefully, conduct additional research to better contextualize and situate the source within the history of this period, and to complete a primary source analysis worksheet for each source (see below).
4. Provide students with class time to work on this assignment. They should also have an opportunity to work on the assignment as homework.
5. After completing the primary source worksheet, each group is paired with another group where they share their primary source analyses with each other. The groups are also tasked with finding themes, commonalities, or connections, or discrepancies/conflicts between their four sources while exploring their perspective and points of view.interrogating the sources for bias.
6. Ask each group to write on a large piece of paper/poster board what they believed were the key tactics/strategies, vision, and goals of the TWLF movement based on their research findings. They can also decorate the poster board with pictures, a copy of their primary source, and other materials.
7. While still in groups of four, assign each group a contemporary social movement. Alternatively, the students can work with the teacher to select the movement that they wish to research.
8. Let each group of four know that they are now responsible for completing the two previous assignments (primary source analysis and poster board) with their new social movement. Students are to identify two primary sources on the movement, conduct research (including a review of secondary sources like credible news articles, scholarly research, interviews, informational videos, etc.), and complete the primary source

Commented [108]: We need to be careful to not imply that bias is a problem -- all sources have implicit or explicit bias.

348

analysis worksheet. They are also to complete a poster board displaying the goals, vision, and tactics/strategies of their assigned contemporary social movement.
9. At the end of the unit, each group presents their poster board and social movement to their peers. After all group presentations have been completed, students will have an opportunity to have a class discussion around the factors that made a social movement successful or unsuccessful, the impact of social movements, and what could have been done differently to have an even stronger impact. The class will ultimately return back to the original guiding questions for the lesson.
10. Students may also examine their own community and see if the need for the social movements still exists today. Students may propose changes to local leaders and participate in programs to resolve problems and create lasting changes.

African American Studies
Sample Lesson 3: U.S. Housing Inequality: Redlining and Racial Housing Covenants Theme: Systems of Power Disciplinary Area: African American Studies Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1, 3, 4; Historical Interpretation 1, 2, 3, 5 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 4, 7; WHST.9�10. 6, 7 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a
352

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson introduces students to the process of purchasing a home, while addressing the history of U.S. housing discrimination. Students will learn about redlining, racial covenants, and better understand why African Americans, as well as other people of color, have historically settled in certain neighborhoods, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, students will be able to better contextualize the state's current housing crisis. With regards to skills, students will analyze primary source documents like original house deeds, conduct research (including locating U.S. census data), and write a brief research essay or complete a presentation on their key findings.
Key Terms and Concepts: segregation, racial housing covenants, gentrification, redlining
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Draw connections between what they learned from the lesson overview, A Raisin in the Sun, and their own narratives, highlighting the overarching theme of housing inequality.
2. Research and Uunderstand how housing inequality has manifest in the form of institutional racism through racial housing covenants, redlining, white flight, and other forms of social and legalized segregation.
3. Engage and comprehend contemporary language being used to describe the current housing crisis and the history of racial housing segregation (i.e., gentrification, resegregation, and redlining).
4. Analyze Lorraine Hansberry's play, A Raisin in the Sun, identifying key themes as they relate to housing discrimination, and become familiar with the use of dramatic devices in written plays
Essential Questions:
1. How are wealth and housing inequality connected? 2. How is housing discrimination and segregation a form of institutional racism?
353

2.3.

How have the demographics of your community changed or not changed

through history? What can be inferred?

Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Introduce the lesson by posting the definition of "racial housing covenants" and "redlining" to engage students in a discussion on the housing conditions African Americans often encounter in urban cities, both in the past and currently.
2. Provide an abbreviated walk-through of how to purchase a home (identifying a realtor, finding a lender, mentioning of the Federal Housing Administration and loan underwriters, etc.). See videos in resources section for more context. 1. Make it clear that Request for students to research and find evidence of how African Americans have historically been subjected to housing discrimination. Provide the examples of the Federal Housing Administration's refusal to underwrite loans for African Americans looking to purchase property in white neighborhoods through 1968, and the California Rumford Fair Housing Act (1963�1968) as back up information. Furthermore, request for provide a more contemporary examples of housing descrimination against African Americans. Provide backup information on the disproportionately provision of being given poor quality housing loans (subprime) to African Americans, (which ultimately resulted in many African American families losing their homes during the 2008 economic crash and recession), if needed (the use of primary sources such as digital maps are suggested for this part of the lesson).
3. Consider using Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun as a supporting text. Have students read Act II Scene III. Following the in-class reading, ask students to reflect on Mr. Lindner's character and how he is connected to the larger discussion of housing inequality. How is Mr. Lindner aiding in housing discrimination?
4. After completing A Raisin in the Sun, continue to build on this lesson by introducing students to "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races," two digital mapping

354

websites that include primary sources on redlining and racial housing covenants in the U.S. Then provide students with an overview of the two websites, highlighting the various features and resources. 5. For the culminating activity, assign students into pairs where they are tasked with delving into the "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races" archives. After identifying a California city (must be a city that is on the T-RACES digital archive) that each pair would like to study, they should be tasked with completing the following over two weeks:
1. Describe how race factors into the makeup of the city being studied 2. Identify any racial housing covenants for the city being studied 3. List any barriers that may have limited African Americans from living in
certain neighborhoods within the city. 4. Identify areas where African Americans were encouraged to live or where
they were able to create racial enclaves. 5. Identify current U.S. Census data and housing maps on how the
city/neighborhoods look now, specifically noting racial demographics.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14 of the framework includes an outline of an elective ethnic studies course. This course outline includes a classroom example (page 313) where students engage in an oral history project about their community. This example includes discussion of redlining and other policies that resulted in "white flight" and the concentration of communities of color into certain neighborhoods.
Teachers can expand upon the current lesson by using this example, and connecting it to the themes described in this model curriculum.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
355

� Students will conduct research (identifying primary sources) on the history of housing discrimination and redlining across California cities,.some of the housing issues today and how different ethnic groups are impacted. � Students will write a standard four paragraph essay or 5�7 minute oral presentation on their research findings and proposals for policy changes. � Have students reflect on how this history of housing discrimination has (or has not) impacted their own families' housing options and livelihoods. � Students will share their research findings and proposals with an audience such as, family, community members, online, elected officials, etc.

MAN Uh--how do you do, miss. I am looking for a Mrs.--(He looks at the slip of paper) Mrs. Lena Younger? (He stops short, struck dumb at the sight of the oblivious WALTER and RUTH)
BENEATHA (Smoothing her hair with slight embarrassment) Oh--yes, that's my mother. Excuse me (She closes the door and turns to quiet the other two) Ruth! Brother! (Enunciating precisely but soundlessly: "There's a white man at the door!" They stop dancing, RUTH cuts off the phonograph, BENEATHA opens the door. The man casts a curious quick glance at all of them) Uh--come in please.
MAN (Coming in) Thank you.
BENEATHA My mother isn't here just now. Is it business?
MAN Yes ... well, of a sort.
WALTER (Freely, the Man of the House) Have a seat. I'm Mrs. Younger's son. I look after most of her business matters. (RUTH and BENEATHA exchange amused glances)
MAN (Regarding WALTER, and sitting) Well--My name is Karl Lindner ...
WALTER (Stretching out his hand) Walter Younger. This is my wife--(RUTH nods politely)--and my sister.
LINDNER How do you do.
WALTER (Amiably, as he sits himself easily on a chair, leaning forward on his knees with interest and looking expectantly into the newcomer's face) What can we do for you, Mr. Lindner!
LINDNER (Some minor shuffling of the hat and briefcase on his knees) Well--I am a representative of the Clybourne Park Improvement Association--
WALTER (Pointing) Why don't you sit your things on the floor?
357

LINDNER Oh--yes. Thank you. (He slides the briefcase and hat under the chair) And as I was saying--I am from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association and we have had it brought to our attention at the last meeting that you people--or at least your mother--has bought a piece of residential property at--(He digs for the slip of paper again)--four o six Clybourne Street ...
WALTER That's right. Care for something to drink? Ruth, get Mr. Lindner a beer.
LINDNER (Upset for some reason) Oh--no, really. I mean thank you very much, but no thank you.
RUTH (Innocently) Some coffee?
LINDNER Thank you, nothing at all. (BENEATHA is watching the man carefully)
LINDNER Well, I don't know how much you folks know about our organization. (He is a gentle man; thoughtful and somewhat labored in his manner) It is one of these community organizations set up to look after--oh, you know, things like block upkeep and special projects and we also have what we call our New Neighbors Orientation Committee ...
BENEATHA (Drily) Yes--and what do they do?
LINDNER (Turning a little to her and then returning the main force to WALTER) Well-- it's what you might call a sort of welcoming committee, I guess. I mean they, we--I'm the chairman of the committee--go around and see the new people who move into the neighborhood and sort of give them the lowdown on the way we do things out in Clybourne Park.
BENEATHA (With appreciation of the two meanings, which escape RUTH and WALTER) Un-huh.
LINDNER And we also have the category of what the association calls--(He looks elsewhere)--uh--special community problems ...
358

BENEATHA Yes--and what are some of those?
WALTER Girl, let the man talk.
LINDNER (With understated relief) Thank you. I would sort of like to explain this thing in my own way. I mean I want to explain to you in a certain way.
WALTER Go ahead.
LINDNER Yes. Well. I'm going to try to get right to the point. I'm sure we'll all appreciate that in the long run.
BENEATHA Yes.
WALTER Be still now!

RUTH (Still innocently) Would you like another chair--you don't look comfortable.
LINDNER (More frustrated than annoyed) No, thank you very much. Please. Well--to get right to the point I--(A great breath, and he is off at last) I am sure you people must be aware of some of the incidents which have happened in various parts of the city when colored people have moved into certain areas--(BENEATHA exhales heavily and starts tossing a piece of fruit up and down in the air) Well--because we have what I think is going to be a unique type of organization in American community life--not only do we deplore that kind of thing--but we are trying to do something about it. (BENEATHA stops tossing and turns with a new and quizzical interest to the man) We feel-- (gaining confidence in his mission because of the interest in the faces of the people he is talking to)--we feel that most of the trouble in this world, when you come right down to it--(He hits his knee for emphasis)--most of the trouble exists because people just don't sit down and talk to each other.
359

RUTH (Nodding as she might in church, pleased with the remark) You can say that again, mister.
LINDNER (More encouraged by such affirmation) That we don't try hard enough in this world to understand the other fellow's problem. The other guy's point of view.
RUTH Now that's right. (BENEATHA and WALTER merely watch and listen with genuine interest)
LINDNER Yes--that's the way we feel out in Clybourne Park. And that's why I was elected to come here this afternoon and talk to you people. Friendly like, you know, the way people should talk to each other and see if we couldn't find some way to work this thing out. As I say, the whole business is a matter of caring about the other fellow. Anybody can see that you are a nice family of folks, hard working and honest I'm sure. (BENEATHA frowns slightly, quizzically, her head tilted regarding him) Today everybody knows what it means to be on the outside of something. And of course, there is always somebody who is out to take advantage of people who don't always understand.
WALTER What do you mean?
LINDNER Well--you see our community is made up of people who've worked hard as the dickens for years to build up that little community. They're not rich and fancy people; just hard-working, honest people who don't really have much but those little homes and a dream of the kind of community they want to raise their children in. Now, I don't say we are perfect and there is a lot wrong in some of the things they want. But you've got to admit that a man, right or wrong, has the right to want to have the neighborhood he lives in a certain kind of way. And at the moment the overwhelming majority of our people out there feel that people get along better, take more of a common interest in the life of the community, when they share a common background. I want you to believe me when I tell you that race prejudice simply doesn't enter into it. It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park believing, rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities.

BENEATHA (With a grand and bitter gesture) This, friends, is the Welcoming Committee! WALTER (Dumbfounded, looking at LINDNER) IS this what you came marching all the way over here to tell us? LINDNER Well, now we've been having a fine conversation. I hope you'll hear me all the way through. WALTER (Tightly) Go ahead, man. LINDNER You see--in the face of all the things I have said, we are prepared to make your family a very generous offer ... BENEATHA Thirty pieces and not a coin less! WALTER Yeah? LINDNER (Putting on his glasses and drawing a form out of the briefcase) Our association is prepared, through the collective effort of our people, to buy the house from you at a financial gain to your family. RUTH Lord have mercy, ain't this the living gall! WALTER All right, you through? LINDNER Well, I want to give you the exact terms of the financial arrangement-- WALTER We don't want to hear no exact terms of no arrangements. I want to know if you got any more to tell us 'bout getting together? LINDNER (Taking off his glasses) Well--I don't suppose that you feel ...
361

WALTER Never mind how I feel--you got any more to say 'bout how people ought to sit down and talk to each other? ... Get out of my house, man. (He turns his back and walks to the door)
LINDNER (Looking around at the hostile faces and reaching and assembling his hat and briefcase) Well--I don't understand why you people are reacting this way. What do you think you are going to gain by moving into a neighborhood where you just aren't wanted and where some elements--well--people can get awful worked up when they feel that their whole way of life and everything they've ever worked for is threatened.
WALTER Get out.
LINDNER (At the door, holding a small card) Well--I'm sorry it went like this.
WALTER Get out.
LINDNER (Almost sadly regarding WALTER) You just can't force people to change their hearts, son. (He turns and put his card on a table and exits. WALTER pushes the door to with stinging hatred, and stands looking at it. RUTH just sits and BENEATHA just stands.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
While there are many diverse groups in the United States, their stories are shaped by their different experiences in the housing, health, economic, education, and justice systems. African American social movements have focused on these different areas with the goals of ending discrimination, combatting racism, and seeking access to civic and economic power. The approach taken in the following lesson on the justice system could also be applied to the examination and response to the issues in housing, health, economics and education. In summary, this approach starts with naming the overarching theme, scaffolding research of a contemporary example, and then supporting students to explore other related topics leading to action steps.
In encountering the justice system, African Americans have historically faced disregard for their civil liberties, higher incarceration rates, and systemic police brutality. This last issue has led to some of the most heinous acts of oppression and sparked some the most visible protests by African American movements.
Students begin by examining will be exposed to contemporary discussions around policing in the U.S., specifically police brutality cases where unarmed African Americans have been killed. They will conduct research on various incidents, examining both scholarly sources and those with particular political perspectivesThey will conduct research on various incidents, deciphering between reputable and scholarly sources versus those with particular political bents. Students will examine the history of the relationship between the police and the Black community to provide historical context and inform possible solutions. Students will also begin to think about how they would respond if an incident took place in their community. Students will have the opportunity, via a social change project, to address a particular incident or related issues related to policing policies, or other issues within the justice system in general, in their communities and the U.S. more broadlyStudents will have the opportunity, via the social change projects, to describe what tools and/or tactics of resistance they would use.

In this lesson students will studybe introduced to how the effects of the Civil War in El Salvador in the 1980s prompted the initial surge of migration from El Salvador to the United States, and the push and pull factors that have impacted immigration from El Salvador since then. Next, students will research the various immigration policies that have regulated immigration from El Salvador since 1965. Key Terms and Concepts: agency, asylum, citizenship, inequality, migration, naturalization, resilience, war refugee.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
 Understand the root causes of the waves of migration from El Salvador to the
United States since the 1980s.
 Identify the major shifts in U.S. immigration policy since 1965, explaining the
events that caused the changes in new policies, the groups impacted, the specific regulations, the positive and negative effectsbenefits, and the restrictions or limitations of the new policies.
 Determine the accuracy of commonly held beliefs about immigration by
investigating statistical evidence.
 Analyze the pros and cons of recentcurrent policies that affect different
groups of immigrants from El Salvador.
 Apply their understanding of the Four I's of Oppression to their analysis of the
history and policies of migration in El Salvador.
Essential Questions:
 What push and pull factors were responsible for the waves of migration from
El Salvador to the United States since the 1980s?
 What values and principles guided U.S. immigration policy?
370

 How can the United States resolve the current controversies surrounding
immigration policy and detention practices?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day One: Building Background Knowledge: Four I's of Oppression and Relationship to Salvadoran Migration to the United States
In this activity students will be learning about the history and systems of oppression related to the migration of people from El Salvador to the United States. In groups of five, students:
1. Begin the activity with the following guiding question: "Why have people emigrated from El Salvador to the United States?" Students should write/pair/share on Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document.
2. Have students view and comment on the "primary text" image. Which type(s) of oppression does this text (Primary text-Child's Drawing, San Jose Las Flores, El Salvador) best exemplify? Record the answer(s) on the Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document. This is where the primary text can be accessed: "When We Were Young / There Was a War" website http://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/yesenia/.
3. Have students watch the documentary "Juan's Story" from When We Were Young website: https://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/juan/. Have students reflect, analyze, and discuss the main themes and types of oppression(s) of "Juan's Story." Record the type of oppression(s) on Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document.
4. Distribute one of the five informational texts (links listed at the end of unit under "Lesson One Materials/Resources) to each student in the small groups of five. Each student will read and annotate one of the texts for important ideas and record key ideas in the "Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document." When sharing ideas, each group member should teach the other
371

group members about the content and discuss the type of oppression in their

respective article.

5. Ask students to collaborate to answer the following two discussion questions.

Ask one member from each of the groups to present the group response:

1. What did you appreciate about this lesson?

2. What new insights do you have about immigration to the United States?

3. How do your new insights change your perspective of your local

community?

2.4.

What changes would you like to see at the local, state, or national

level?

Day Two: Youth Scholars Teach U.S. Immigration Policy Shifts to the People

In this activity, students will investigate how U.S. immigration policies evolved in response to historical events. Small groups will be assigned to research one of five shifts in immigration policy and collaborate to create presentation slides on the new policy.

1. Distribute the Push and Pull Factors Activity handout to students. Instruct students to work independently first to rank the factors in terms of which have historically been the three most significant push and pull factors prompting immigration to the United States. They must then select the top three most significant current push and pull factors and explain why they choose those factors.
2. Once students have determined their rankings, group them in fours and instruct them to compare their rankings, and to try to come to a consensus on the top three factors for each as a group. Instruct each group to share their top factors for each with the class, and then facilitate a short discussion, noting similarities and differences between each group's answers while asking probing questions to get students to support their arguments with evidence.
3. Inform students that they will be learning about how the actual immigration system determines who is able to immigrate and who isn't. They will work in

Formatted: Space After: 12 pt

372

small groups to research one of six immigration policies beginning with the

Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965. Distribute the Immigration

Presentation Assignment Sheet and explain the expectations to students. (For

more background on the racist origins of the Immigration Act of 1924 you can

read with students "DACA, The 1924 Immigration Act, and American Exclusion"

in the Huffington Post, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daca-the-1924-

immigration-act-and-american-exclusion_b_59b1650ee4b0bef3378cde32).

4. Next, assign students to small groups to research one of the six policies

regulating the American immigration system since 1965.

5. Have students start their research by reading the relevant section of Juan's story

on the tab marked "U.S. Immigration: A Policy in Flux" to get basic background

overview of their assigned policy

(https://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/juan/#top). Directions for

which paragraph of "A Policy in Flux" to read for each topic are in parenthesis

behind the topic title on the assignment sheet. Additional links are provided for

each of the other topics, but students can research additional online resources to

create their presentations.

6. Instruct students to use the Immigration Presentation Assignment Sheet to

prepare the research for presentation on a slide presentation program. Have

students analyze which of the Four I's of Oppression explain the implementation

of the immigration policy and include it in the slides presentation.

7. Have students refer back to the opening activity, and ask which of the factors

determining immigration preference influenced each of the policies. Naturally,

this will lead to a discussion of whether the United States is implementing a fair

and principled immigration policy.

7.8.

Students may investigate how local communities are affected by

immigration policies and what institutions are being used to support current

immigration policies and practices. At the same time, students may examine

what resources are available for those afflicted by current policies.

Instructions: Which texts go with each type of oppression? Write the name of the text in the correct oppression box and explain the connection.

Four I's of Oppression

Student Answer

376

Ideological Oppression

[student response]

The idea that one group is better than another, and has the right to control the "other" group. The idea that one group is more intelligent, more advanced, more deserving, superior, and hold more power. The very intentional ideological development of the ...isms Examples: dominant narratives, "Othering."

377

Institutional Oppression

[student response]

The network of institutional structures, policies, and practices that create advantages and benefits for some, and discrimination, oppression, and disadvantages for others. (Institutions are the organized bodies such as companies, governmental bodies, prisons, schools, non-governmental organizations, families, and religious institutions, among others).

378

Interpersonal Oppression [student response] Interactions between people where people use oppressive behavior, insults or violence. Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close--the racist jokes, the stereotypes, the beatings and harassment, the threats, the whole range of personal acts of discrimination. Similarly, interpersonal sexism is what men to do to women--the sexual abuse/harassment, the violence directed at women, the sexist jokes, ignoring or minimizing of women's thinking, etc. Many people in each dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards other groups quite normal.
379

Internalized Oppression

[student response]

The process by which a member of an oppressed group comes to accept and live out the inaccurate myths and stereotypes applied to the group by its oppressors. Internalized oppression means the oppressor doesn't have to exert any more pressure, because we now do it to ourselves and each other. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, the see it reflected in the institutions, they experience mistreatment interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
The lesson is applicable to many U.S. urban areas but is written specifically about the Los Angeles Boyle Heights area. Some students in urban working-class communities have been impacted by gentrification (the process of upgrading a neighborhood while pushing out working class communities), the growing housing crisis, and being undocumented/DACAmented. Consequently, many families have experienced detention and deportation, while others express growing concerns of being pushed out of their community altogether.
This lesson introduces students to the plight of undocumented immigrants, gentrification in the greater Los Angeles area, cultural preservation vs. assimilation, and Greek mythology and tragedy. Students will learn about the use of immigrant laborers for the construction and garment industry; the impact of drug cartels and lack of opportunities in Mexico and how that factors into people's decision to emigrate; and how contemporary playwrights of color are leveraging ancient literature and theatre to discuss modern-day issues.
Key Terms and Concepts: colonialism, cultural preservation, assimilation, gentrification, undocumented, patriarchy, machismo, barrios
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Develop an understanding about the process of migration, assimilation, cultural preservation, and gentrification.
384

2. Engage key English language arts content, such as literary and dramatic devices.
3. Explain how organizing and advocacy counteract institutional racism as it relates to housing and immigration.
Essential Questions:
1. What is gentrification and why is it disproportionately impacting communities of color? What are the short and long term effects on communities of color?
2. How and why were barrios created? How did it influence the identity and experiences of the communities living there?
3. Why do indigenous populations from Mexico and Latin America migrate to the U.S.? What are the push and pull factors? To what extent has migration been a positive/negative experience for these populations?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Begin the lesson by posting the definition to bruja, chisme, curandera, El Guaco, migra, mojada, and N�huatl[1] on the board. Provide definitions of multiculturalism and assimilation or provide time for students to research these topics. Discuss the similarities and differences between the two. Also provide a compare and contrast chart of the ancient Greek playwright, Euripides, and the contemporary Xicanx playwright Luis Alfaro--author of Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles. In this introduction, thoroughly cover the tenets of Greek mythology and tragedy, the traditional roles of women in Ancient Greece, the garment industry in Los Angeles, the use of immigrant labor to construct the edifices of gentrification development, and drug cartels in the Mexican state of Michoac�n.
385

a. If available, consult with the English Department of your site to collaborate on a reader's theatre approach to the play Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles. Students could be provided time to engage the play in both classes.
2. Following the in-class readings, ask the students to reflect on the characters and their relationship to immigration, gentrification and cultural preservation vs. assimilation. Later divide students into small groups where they are tasked with responding to the following questions. The questions can be divided equally per group, or the teacher can choose to focus on some of them as time allows.
a. Have students take five to ten minutes to research online the definition of tragic hero. After completing this task, ask the students to respond to the following questions: (1) To what extent does Medea fit the definition of a tragic hero? (2) What is her tragic flaw? (3) What does Medea learn from her journey? (4) What does the audience learn from her journey?
b. At the beginning of the play, Tita says that being in the United States is Hason's dream. What is his dream? How do Medea and Acan fit into his dream? What is Medea's dream?
c. Refer to your research on multiculturalism vs. assimilation. Which characters are able to assimilate to living in the United States? What are the benefits for characters that are able to assimilate? Which characters are not able to? What is the cost of their inability to assimilate? Which characters are able to be in the United States and still maintain their native culture?
d. Have students find Michoac�n and Boyle Heights using print or electronic mGoogle Maps. How is the physical environment of Michoac�n different from that of Boyle Heights? Why can't Medea leave her yard? What role does Medea's environment play in her inability to assimilate?
e. In what ways are Medea and her family in exile? How does immigration and specifically the idea of exile help the audience understand Medea's journey in the play?
386

f. What abilities does Medea possess that keep her connected to her Mexican culture? In what ways does this connection conflict with Hason and Acan's desires to fit in and become "American"?
g. What is Hason willing to do to achieve success in the United States? Does he make those choices for his family or for personal fulfillment? What are the consequences of his ambition?
h. In what way does the assault Medea experienced during her journey affect her ability to adjust and thrive in the United States? When accosted by the soldiers at the border why does Medea sacrifice herself? How does Medea's sacrifice affect her relationship with Hason?
i. Compare and contrast Medea, Armida, and Josefina. What were their journeys to get to the United States? How does each react to being in a new country? In what ways does each woman's choices bring them success? What is the cost of some of their choices?
j. Refer to your research on and discussion of multiculturalism and assimilation. What comparisons do Medea, Tita, Josefina, and Armida make between Mexico and United States? In what ways is the love of their culture and Mexican way of life seen as anti-American and by whom? How does each character reconcile the division they experience between old and new worlds, if at all?
k. In what ways is Euripides' Medea hindered by a male-dominant society? In what ways is Alfaro's Medea hindered by a male-dominant society? How do Tita, Josefina, and Armida work with or against their gender roles to survive and achieve success? In what ways is Hason privileged by these traditional gender roles? In what ways is he hindered by traditional expectations?
387

l. In what ways is Acan torn between the old world of his mother and the new world his father has decided to embrace? In what ways does he contribute to Medea taking vengeance?
m. How does the revelation of Medea's circumstances in Mexico and the reason for leaving heighten the stakes surrounding the eviction from her apartment? What is Medea running from and why? What does her past tell us about her in the present?
n. Why does Medea refer to herself as a mojada or wetback with Armida? In what ways does she believe she is a mojada? In what ways does she not? What is the significance of the title, Mojada: A Relocation of Medea?
o. What events contribute to Medea taking vengeance on Hason and Armida? In what ways does the story of Medea's life in Michoac�n contribute to her killing Armida and Acan? Why does Medea kill Acan?
p. Who has betrayed Medea in Mexico and in the U.S., and in what ways? What effect do these betrayals have on her? How do the betrayals contribute to her actions at the end of the play?
q. Refer to on the definition of el guaco provided at the beginning of the lesson. In what ways is Medea like el guaco? What becomes of Medea at the end of the play? What could her final transformation symbolize?
r. If you are seeing Julius Caesar, compare and contrast what Brutus and Medea want to pass on to the next generation, versus Hason and Caesar. In what ways is violence a part of the legacies of Brutus and Medea? In what ways is it a part of Hason and Caesar's legacies? How do Hason and Caesar contribute to their own downfalls? What other actions could Brutus have taken toward Caesar and Medea toward Hason?
388

3. Have students demonstrate their knowledge by developing and delivering a brief presentation that highlights the concepts learned from the play to current topics of immigration and gentrification in their respective communities.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the English Language Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) Framework:
These two curriculum frameworks contain an extensive lesson example that shows how teachers can work with colleagues across disciplines to address a common topic. In this case, the example is how a language arts teacher and history�social science teacher collaborate to teach the novel Things Fall Apart, addressing both language arts and history�social science standards in their instruction (the example begins on page 338 in the History�Social Science Framework, and page 744 of the ELA/ELD Framework).
Ethnic studies educators should also consider how they can collaborate with their peers to integrate ethnic studies instruction with content in other areas. Depending on which grade level the ethnic studies course is being offered, the ethnic studies educator can include a literary selection that connects to the content students are studying in their history�social science classroom, or work with the language arts teacher on lessons that address grade-level standards in reading or writing.

Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
� Students will work in groups to analyze and discuss the text while responding to the provided questions.
� Students deliver a presentation to an authentic audience that connects the play to experiences in their communities.
 After performances, students lead discussions with different audiences and use these conversations to begin advocacy for changes in their communities.

Sample Lesson 7: The East L.A. Blowouts: An Anchor to the Chicano Movement Theme: Social Movements and Equity Disciplinary Area: Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1-3; Historical Interpretation 1, 3, 4 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH. 9�10. 2, 3, 4; WHST. 9�10. 4, 8, 9 CA ELD Standards: ELD. PI. 9�10. 1, 2, 5, 6a, 9 Lesson Purpose and Overview: This lesson will introduce students to the East Los Angeles Student blowouts (or walkouts) of 1968 and the Chicano Movement. They will have an opportunity to explore the range of student response to discrimination and injustices that were manifesting in public education. At the onset, students will engage in critical dialogue and inquiry about early Chicana/o/x youth and social movements, and conclude the lesson by drawing connections to current injustices and issues confronting Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Americans in schools. Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
390

1. Gain a better understanding of root causes of protests, revolutions, and uprisings.
2. Articulate the history of the East Los Angeles student blow outs and the Chicano Movement, with a focus on key leaders, movement demands, and outcomes.
Essential Questions: 1. How did the students from East Los Angeles respond to discrimination and injustice within the educational system, and to what extent did it lead to change? 2. How were the East Los Angeles blowouts and the broader Chicano Movement connected to the same root causes? 3. How is transformative social change possible when working within existing institutions, like the public school system? 4. What is the role of education and who should have the power to shape what is taught?
Lesson Steps/Activities: 1. Open the class by displaying the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times article, "East L.A., 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement:
"LOS ANGELES -- Teachers at Garfield High School were winding down classes before lunch. Then they heard the startling sound of people running the halls, pounding on classroom doors. `Walkout' they were shouting. `Walkout!' Students left classrooms and gathered in front of the school entrance. They held their clenched fists high. `Viva la revoluci�n!' they called out. `Education, not eradication!'
391

It was just past noon on a sunny Tuesday, March 5, 1968 -- the day a revolution began for Mexican-Americans, people whose families came to the United States from Mexico."
2. Proceed to ask students why they think students at Garfield were shouting "Walkout", and what do the phrases "Viva la revoluci�n!" and "Education, not eradication!" mean? In pairs, students discuss the above questions, later sharing their thoughts with the entire class. Following discussion, provide definitions for the following terms: protest, eradication, revoluci�n, uprising, Chicano, Brown Berets, and unrest. Then instruct students to read, "East L.A. 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement".
3. After giving students about fifteen minutes to read the article and discuss their immediate reactions in think, pair and share formats, proceed to write down any questions students may have about the article on the board and respond to them. 1. To supplement the article, play a short video clip on the youth movement, "The 1968 student walkout that galvanized a national movement for Chicano rights."
4. Following the screening, lead a discussion about how the students experienced police aggression and were even targeted with federal charges for "invoking riots." Be sure to emphasize that the students were resilient and persisted in other forms of protest by organizing their peers and parents, and attending school board meetings where they presented a list of demands.
5. Hand each pair a copy of the two primary sources listed below.
"Student Walkout Demands," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Board of Education
No student or teacher will be reprimanded or suspended for participating in any efforts which are executed for the purpose of improving or furthering the educational quality in our schools.
392

Bilingual-Bi-cultural education will be compulsory for Mexican-Americans in the Los Angeles City School System where there is a majority of Mexican-American students. This program will be open to all other students on a voluntary basis.
In-service education programs will be instituted immediately for all staff in order to teach them the Spanish language and increase their understanding of the history, traditions, and contributions of the Mexican culture.
All administrators in the elementary and secondary schools in these areas will become proficient in the Spanish language. Participants are to be compensated during the training period at not less than $8.80 an hour and upon completion of the course will receive in addition to their salary not less than $100.00 a month. The monies for these programs will come from local funds, state funds and matching federal funds.
Administrators and teachers who show any form of prejudice toward Mexican or Mexican-American students, including failure to recognize, understand, and appreciate Mexican culture and heritage, will be removed from East Los Angeles schools. This will be decided by a Citizens Review Board selected by the Educational Issues Committee.
Textbooks and curriculum will be developed to show Mexican and MexicanAmerican contribution to the U.S. society and to show the injustices that Mexicans have suffered as a culture of that society. Textbooks should concentrate on Mexican folklore rather than English folklore.
All administrators where schools have majority of Mexican-American descent shall be of Mexican- American descent. If necessary, training programs should be instituted to provide a cadre of Mexican-American administrators.
Every teacher's ratio of failure per students in his classroom shall be made available to community groups and students. Any teacher having a particularly high percentage of the total school dropouts in his classes shall be rated by the Citizens Review Board composed of the Educational Issues Committee.
393

"Student Rights," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Board of Education:
Corporal punishment will only be administrated according to State Law.
Teachers and administrators will be rated by the students at the end of each semester.
Students should have access to any type of literature and should be allowed to bring it on campus.
Students who spend time helping teachers shall be given monetary and/or credit compensation.
Students will be allowed to have guest speakers to club meetings. The only regulation should be to inform the club sponsor.
Dress and grooming standards will be determined by a group of a) students and b) parents.
Student body offices shall be open to all students. A high-grade point average shall not be considered as a pre-requisite to eligibility.
Entrances to all buildings and restrooms should be accessible to all students during school hours. Security can be enforced by designated students.
Student menus should be Mexican oriented. When Mexican food is served, mothers from the barrios should come to the school and help supervise the preparation of the food. These mothers will meet the food handler requirements of Los Angeles City Schools and they will be compensated for their services.
School janitorial services should be restricted to the employees hired for that purposes by the school board. Students will [not] be punished by picking up paper or trash and keeping them out of class.
Only area superintendents can suspend students.
394

6. After reading the primary source documents, proceed to have the pairs construct what their own demands would be if they were to organize a presentation to the Board of Education on flip chart paper. Once the pairs have completed their own demands, then task the students with responding to the following reflection questions related to the primary sources listed above: 1. What student demand do you think is the most important, and why? 2. What is one student right you would add to this list? 3. Which student rights and/or demands do you view as less important, and why? 4. The East Los Angeles Walkouts were led by students. Do you think they would've been more effective if they had been led by teachers or other adults, why or why not? 5. What do you think happened after the East Los Angeles Walkouts? 6. What is happening in the U.S. currently that relates to the 1968 East Los Angeles Walkouts? 7. What other youth-led movements have occurred within contemporary U.S. history? 8. Beyond walkouts, what are other ways students can best advocate for themselves?
7. Finally, each pair is given the opportunity to present their proposed student demands and response to question number eight to the entire class.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will show understanding of the content by discussing and responding to the questions provided.
 Students will create a presentation of demands on how to improve schools in their district.

Sample Lesson 8: Hmong Americans--Community, Struggle, Voice
Theme: History and Movement
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Hmong Americans are seen as Asian Americans, yet they have a very unique experience and history in the U.S. The goal of this lesson is to delve deeply into their experience and understand their formation as a community and as a voice within American society. This lesson uses the voices of Hmong women, men, girls, and boys, as well as an article from the Amerasia Journal to create an understanding of the issues and experiences of the Hmong American Community.
Key Terms and Concepts: Hmong, oral history, Laos, CIA, Refugee Resettlement Act of 1980, Asian American, Secret War in Laos, Patriarchy
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Better understand the diversity of experiences of Hmong Americans by engaging a range of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, poems, and scholarly articles.
� Write their own spoken word piece about their lived experiences. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure poetry, as well as techniques for performing.

Commented [109]: @dhess@berkeley.edu I thought the passive questioning was in Appendix B, but it was actually one of the UC course samples. So, it didn't apply as much. I still struggle to figure out how to instill community/civic action in this sample lesson.
Commented [110]: Just realized that I had added onto questions you posed and added, which became the following:
vi. What current school policies should be changed to eliminate criminalization of youth and create acceptance? vii. (How should school leaders and civic leaders change policing practices?) What do students need to feel empowered to use their rights and responsibilities in a democratic society to address the issues they are most concerned with in their community? i. What persuasive arguments would students make to promote positive systemic change? Who should they be collaborating with? What strategies can they deploy to take action to support and advocate for the needs of their community?

398

Essential Questions:

1. What is the history of Hmong immigration to the U.S.?

2. How did first generation Hmong immigrants' experiences differ from their children

who were born in the U.S.? How did gender factor into differing experiences?

2.3.

How can we, and/or American society, better engage with, include, or

support Hmong Americans as equals while honoring their unique experience?

Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone here has experiences or a personal identity that they feel could help others better understand this content, feel free, but not required, to add to our discussions"
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about the Hmong in America and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about the Hmong. The teacher asks students if they have questions about the Hmong, and writes them on the white board.
4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong community in the U.S. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.
5. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Hmong experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a video interview of a Hmong couple who immigrated to the U.S. Note that the videos have subtitles and that students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured to get to the U.S as they watch the video:

"Starting Again in the Refugee Camp" A short Documentary about Pang Ge Yang and Mee Lee. An incredible story of Love, Loss and Hope. At the end of the Secret War, Pang Ge Yang escapes from Laos into Thailand. Through the harsh journey through the jungle, Pang Ge's pregnant wife dies and he is unable to leave her body for three days. Mee Lee also is fleeing war torn Laos, and her husband dies during the escape. Mee found herself as a near death, broken widow in the Thailand refugee camps. After losing everything, a miracle happens and these two widows find each other and a new reason for life again in each other. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWU5zP-B6g (9 mins)
7. The teacher shows two spoken word poems of two teenage Hmong females. As students watch them, they should think about how these individuals have developed their identity as being Hmong American. As students watch, they should consider what it is like to be a young Hmong American woman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XxuyYI6ho
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (How do these poets describe their experiences and young Hmong-American women?) for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� being caught between two worlds, with their parents and the pressures of American society, language barrier with parents and not fully accepted into the American society
� the frustration they feel not being appreciated for being Hmong but rather being called Chinese or from Hong Kong
� living in a patriarchy and family expectations, and family hypocrisies
400

� feeling ashamed not meeting the high expectations of the American educational system
� feeling proud to be Hmong and a daughter
� learning how to embrace their heritage and culture but at the same time pursue their dreams of going to college
� developing an identity of their own as proud Hmong Americans
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Criminalization and Second Generation of Hmong American Boys." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Hmong American male? (pages 113-116, "Criminalization and Second Generation Hmong American Boys" by Bao Lo.) 1. As students read the article, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text. 2. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Bao Lo, what is it like to be a young Hmong American male? 3. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Similar to African American and Latino young males, Hmong young males are thought of as gangsters, drop outs and delinquents by law enforcement and authority figures.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding incarceration and criminalization in research and public policy shows a need to understand it better.
401

iii. Teachers often treat the dress of baggy clothing, quietness, and swaggering of the Hmong boys as deviant.
iv. This implicit bias among authority members leads to racial profiling of Hmong boys and leads to the boys feeling of isolation and frustration.
v. The criminalization of men and boys of color goes hand in hand with the decriminalization of white males as a result white criminality is less controlled, surveilled and punished while black, Latino, and Southeast Asian criminality is treated at threatening and in need of punishment.
vi. What are the cultural differences between school staff and black, Latino, and Hmong students?
1. What current school policies should be changed to eliminate criminalization of youth and create acceptance?
i. How should school leaders and civic leaders change policing practices? What could students do to facilitate policy changes?
ii. What persuasive arguments would students make to promote positive change in their local communities? Who should they be collaborating with? What strategies can they deploy to take action to support and advocate for the needs of their community?
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework includes a description of the impact of the Vietnam War, including the experiences of refugees. On pages 423�425 there is a classroom example where students study the impact of the war on the United States. You can extend this context to this lesson by asking students to research the following questions:

Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong in the U.S.
� The Hmong are an ethnic group that lives in the mountains primarily in southern China, Laos, Burma, northern Vietnam and Thailand. They are a subgroup of the Miao ethnic group and have more than one dialect within and among the different Hmong communities.
� During the Vietnam War, Laos also experienced a civil war in which three princes sought control over the Royal Lao government. One of the princes sought support from the Vietnamese communists, while the other sought support from the U.S. Both sides swept in and recruited Hmong to join their military forces.
� The most successful was the Royal Lao government, which was backed by the U.S. CIA.
� In 1961, 18,000 young Hmong men joined the U.S. backed armies in the Secret War in Laos with the promise that the Royal Lao government and the U.S. would take care of them if Laos fell to the communists.
� When Vietnam and Laos fell to the communists in 1973, the Hmong were persecuted by the communists causing most to flee their homeland. The majority crossed the Mekong River and made their way to Thailand to live in refugee camps.
� Several families stayed in these camps for years until being processed and either returned to their home countries or sent to the U.S.
� The U.S. refugee resettlement Act of 1980 brought in over 200,000 Hmong families to live in cities spread across the U.S. from 1980-2000.
� Over the years, the Hmong migrated to specific Hmong ethnic enclaves within U.S. cities within California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
404

� From the mid-1980s�2000s there has been a gradual rise in undergraduate college enrollment particularly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California. This has led to college courses on Hmong language and Hmong American history and culture.
� Today there are large Hmong communities in Fresno, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Sacramento, Merced, Milwaukee, Wausau, and Green Bay, with the total population over 300,000.
� The Hmong have played a key role in helping the farm communities grow and flourish.
� The rich Hmong culture involved embroidery, story clothes, ghost stories, and many rituals.
� Although the Hmong fall under the category of Asian American in the U.S., they endure one of the highest poverty rates at 37.8 in 2004 among all ethnic groups so they do not receive the services they need because they have been lumped into the Asian American group.
� The Hmong struggle with the dual identities of being labeled as the Model Minority or as criminals for the young males.

408

CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11a.
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Students will be introduced to the history of the United Farm Workers (UFW) Movement, Filipino migration to Stockton, the formation of "Little Manila," and protest music. Students will be introduced to the organizing and intercultural relations between the Filipino and Mexican farmworkers. Students will also complete a cultural analysis assignment on the topic.
Key Terms and Concepts: United Farm Workers (UFW), Pinay and Pinoy, strike, protest music, labor union, intercultural relations
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...): 1. Understand the history of the UFW movement and how it brought together both Filipino and Mexican laborers. 2. Understand Filipino migration to Stockton, California. 3. Further develop their oral presentation, public speaking, and analysis skills via the cultural analysis assignment.
Essential Questions: 1. How do you build solidarity within social movements? 2. What is the role of art and culture within social movements?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1 1. Provide an introduction of the United Farm Workers movement, highlighting the work of Larry Itliong, Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta, and others, while foregrounding the goals, tactics, and accomplishments of the movement.
409

2. Following the introduction, screen the KVIE produced short film, Little Manila: Filipinos in California's Heartland. Before starting the video, tell students that they are responsible for taking thorough notes (refer to a graphic organizer or note taking tool) and will be expected to have a discussion around the following guiding questions:
a. Why was Stockton a popular landing place for Filipino immigrants? b. What crop did Filipinos primarily harvest in Stockton? c. How did Filipino farm workers build community and develop a new social identity in Stockton? d. How did colonialism shape Filipino immigrants' impression of the U.S.? e. What U.S. policies were implemented to limit Filipino immigration? How did Filipinos in Stockton resist these policies? f. What were some political and strategic differences of Cesar Chavez and Larry Itliong? g. What role did Filipinos play in the formation of the United Farm Workers? h. How did urban redevelopment aid in the destruction of Little Manila? 3. Provide the following key terms for students to define using context clues from the film: a. Mestizos b. Anti-miscegenation c. Race riots d. Naturalization e. War brides
410

f. Pinay and Pinoy
g. Urban redevelopment
h. Labor union
4. Following the film, divide the students into groups of four to five. Each group is given twenty minutes to read the following excerpt, discuss the film, respond to the aforementioned guiding questions, and come up with definitions for the terms listed above.
5. Excerpt from Our Stories in Our Voices "Filipinos and Mexicans for the United Farm Workers Union" by James Sobredo:
a. By the 1950s and 1960s, the remaining Filipinos in the United States are now much older. They were also working side-by-side with other Mexican farm workers. Then in 1965, under the leadership of Larry Itliong, Filipinos went on strike for better salaries and working conditions in Delano. Itliong had been a long-time labor union organizer, but although they won strikes in the past, they had never been able to gain recognition as a union for farm workers. To make matters worse, when Filipinos went on strike, Mexican farm workers were brought in by the farmers to break the strike; in the same way, when Mexican farm workers went on strike, Filipinos were brought in to break their strike. Itliong recognized this problem, so he asked Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, who had been organizing Mexican farm workers, to meet with him. Itliong asked Chavez to join the Filipino grape strike, but Cesar refused because he did not feel that they were ready. It was Huerta, who had known Itliong when she lived and worked in Stockton, who convinced Chavez to join the Filipino strike. Thus, for the first time in history, Filipinos and Mexicans joined forces and had a unified strike for union recognition and workers' rights. This led to the establishment of the United Farm Workers union (UFW), which brought together the Filipino workers of the Agricultural Workers Organizing
411

Committee (AWOC) and the Mexican workers of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in a joint strike.
One of the important labor actions the UFW did to gather support for the Grape Strike was a 300-mile march from the UFW headquarters in Delano in the Central Valley to the State Capitol in Sacramento. The march started on March 17, 1966, when 75 Filipino and Mexican farm workers started their long trek down from Delano, taking country roads close to Highway 99, all the way up to Sacramento. They were stopping and spending the night at small towns along the way, giving speeches, theater performances, and singing songs. They were following the tradition of nonviolent protests started by Mahatma Gandhi in India and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the South. The march to Sacramento was very successful. By the time, the Filipinos and Mexicans arrived in Sacramento, they were now 10,000 marchers strong, and the march brought more media coverage and national support to the UFW grape strike...
The connection to the Filipino and Mexican farmworkers remains a strong thread in the California Assembly. Rob Bonta (Democrat, 18 District) is the first Filipino American Assembly member to be elected to office. He is the son of Filipino labor union organizers and grew up in La Paz, in Kern County, in a "trailer just a few hundred yards from Cesar Chavez's home." His parents were civil rights activists and labor union organizers who worked with the UFW to organize Filipino and Mexican farm workers...
6. While students are working in groups, write down the eight key terms on the white board, leaving plenty room between each. After the time has expired, signal to students that it is time to come back together. Facilitate a discussion where students are able to respond to each of the guiding questions aloud. Finally, ask one member from each group to go to the board. Each student is assigned a word and is expected to write their definition of the word with their group's support. After completing this task, the class talks through each term.
412

Provide additional information, examples, and support to better clarify and define the terms.
7. Close with student and community reflection.
Day 2
1. Bring to class a carton of strawberries and grapes, several pieces of sugar cane, and a few asparagus spears. Engage the class by asking how many students have ever worked on a farm or have grown their own food? Then ask if anyone knows how the food items brought in are grown and/or harvested? Let students know that the food items brought in are among some of the most laborintensive to harvest, are in high demand, and are largely hand-picked or cut by often under-paid farm workers. Proceed to display images detailing the process of each crop being harvested. Be sure to highlight that farm labor is often repetitive and menial, yet damaging to the body. After completing this overview, allow the students to eat the food items brought in.
2. After the discussion about harvesting crops, play "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun", a song by Daniel Valdez that was popularized during the United Farm Workers Movement. After listening to the song, ask students what the song is about? Allow for about ten minutes of discussion followed by an overview on protest songs and music that were played/sung while Filipino and Mexican workers toiled the fields and during protests. The overview should foreground the Filipino contribution in the UFW, like the book Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itliong. Then proceed to describe how protest and work songs provided a unifying message, energized crowds during rallies and marches, and helped amplify dissent.
3. Following this overview, divide students into pairs. Each pair is then assigned a protest or work song from the list below (students also have the option to create their own protest song):
413

a. "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun" by Daniel Valdez, Sylvia Galan, and Pedro Contreras b. "Huelga En General"/ "General Strike" by Luis Valdez c. "El Esquirol"/ "The Scab" by Teatro Campesino d. No Nos Mover�n e. "Pastures of Plenty" by Woody Guthrie f. "Solidaridad (Pa) Para Siempre" (Solidarity forever) g. "Nosotros Venceremos" (We shall overcome) 4. Let the pairs know that they will be responsible for completing a two-page cultural analysis essay that must address the following steps and prompts: a. Find the lyrics and an audio recording of your assigned song. b. Analyze the song and identify three to five key themes or points. c. What is the purpose and/or meaning of this song? d. Who is the intended audience? e. What types of instruments, sounds, poetic devices, etc., are used? f. How does this song situate within the history of Filipino farm workers and the broader United Farm workers' movement? 5. Allow the pairs to use the remainder of the class period to listen to their songs and take notes. In addition, students can invite other classes and have a listening party. Give the students ample time in class for the next two days to work on their essays. During those days offer writing support, carving out time to help each pair craft their thesis statement, core arguments, and better structure their essays overall.
414

6. On the final day, each pair exchanges their essay with another pair. The pairs are given fifteen minutes to conduct a brief peer review of each essay. After the review, have a "listening party". The entire class is given the opportunity to listen to the various songs. After each song is played, the pair that wrote an essay on the song, and the pair that reviewed the song, are able to briefly share their thoughts and analysis of the cultural text to the class.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
Students will complete a cultural analysis essay where they are expected to analyze protest songs (or other cultural texts) that were assigned to them in class. Their analysis should include themes that emerged in the songs, connecting them back to the history, struggles, tactics, leaders, and goals of the UFW.
Students may advocate for local communities resources to be used to enrich and expand cultural activities and performances that are reflective of current and past people.

Sample Lesson 10: Chinese Railroad Workers Theme: Systems of Power Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Standards Alignment: HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 2; Historical Interpretation 1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 6, 9, SL.9�10.1.A, 1.B, 1.C. Lesson Purpose and Overview: The contributions of people of color to the development of the economic development and infrastructure of the United States are too often minimized or overlooked. Chinese Americans are Americans and have played a key role in building this country. Had it not been for this work force, one of the greatest engineering feats of the 19th century (the railroad), would not have been built within the allotted timeline. Asian Americans have been active labor organizers and strikers throughout history to fight racism and exploitation. The image of the transcontinental railroads meeting at Promontory Point on May 10, 18691969, with no Chinese workers exemplifies the white supremacy view of U.S. history. Key Terms and Concepts: systems of power, assimilate, transcontinental, Central Pacific Railroad Company (CPRR), congenial, amassed Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
416

1. Understand how Asian Americans have been active labor organizers and strikers throughout history to fight racism and exploitation. 2. Develop an appreciation for the contributions of Chinese Americans to U.S. history and infrastructure. 3. Students will develop their speaking skills through a Socratic seminar discussion. Essential Questions: 1. How have Asian Americans responded to repressive conditions in U.S. history? 2. What role have Asian Americans played in the labor movement? 3. Why is it important to recognize the contributions of immigrant labor in building the wealth of the United States? 4. Why is it important to remember the Chinese Railroad Strike? Lesson Steps/Activities: Overview: Day 1 � Transcontinental Railroad and Chinese Immigration Day 2 � Chinese Labor and the Building of the Transcontinental Railroad Day 3 � Commemoration of the Golden Spike Detailed Daily Lesson Procedures Day 1 � Transcontinental Railroad and Chinese Immigration 1. Post the image of a Chinese railroad worker on the screen.
417

a. Students are asked to estimate when the photo was taken, who is shown in the photo, and what historical event or events they think are connected to the photograph.
b. Teacher will ask students what they know about Chinese Americans and their contributions to the U.S.
2. Introduce the lesson with the key overarching questions:
a. To what extent did immigrant labor contribute to building the wealth of the U.S.?
b. To what extent did those laborers benefit from the wealth they helped build?
3. Read "The Chinese Experience in 19th Century America � Background for Teachers", and the "Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project" at Stanford University.
a. Have students read in pairs using any reading strategy for the level of the class (annotation, mark the text, Cornell notes, choral reading, etc.)
b. Respond to Key Questions and answer the questions on the students' handout (see attached).
Day 2 � Chinese Labor and the Building of the Transcontinental Railroad
1. Teacher discusses the answers to the questions students have completed and asks the question:
a. To what extent have Chinese Railroad workers been given credit for their contribution to the building of the transcontinental railroad?
b. Have students look up "transcontinental railroad" in the index of their US History textbook and have them look for text on Chinese laborers.
418

2. Show on the screen the image of the May 10, 1869, Promontory Point celebration.
3. Have students analyze the photograph.
a. Who is featured in the photo? Where and when was the photo taken? Why was the photo taken?
b. Who is not featured in the photo? Why do you think that is?
4. Show video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUP8DJpMsandt=6s, tell the students to pay special attention to Connie Young Yu's interview from 1:59�2:31. The whole video is 5:31 minutes.
5. Provide students time to reflect on what they have seen in the video by having students complete a five-minute free-write brainstorm on the following questions: Based on the interviews in the video, why is it important to recognize of the contributions of Chinese laborers? Why is that recognition meaningful to people within the ChineseAmerican community? How does the exclusion of Chinese and Chinese-American contributions to the United States, including the railroad, affect our understanding of history?
6. After students have completed their free-write, have students assemble in pairs or groups of three. Have students share their responses with one another. When the discussion begins to wind down, have the class reconvene as a whole group. Have students share their thoughts and ideas with the whole class.
7. Tell students that this video shows the importance of recognizing the contributions of Chinese laborers more than one hundred years after the building of the railroad. Ask students these final questions: How do you think Chinese laborers and Chinese immigrants were treated at the time? Provide students with copies of excerpts from David Phillips' discussion of "The Chinese Question," Edward Holton's observations about Dennis Kearney, and "Enactments So Utterly Un-American" by Constance Gordon-Cumming, which can all be found on the Library of Congress website: https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentatio
419

ns/timeline/riseind/chinimms/. As students read, have them identify the conflicting attitudes towards the presence of Chinese laborers in California, noting the arguments presented for the exclusion and inclusion of Chinese laborers.
8. After students have read the document excerpts, explain to students that the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Have students look up this event in their textbooks and discuss with a partner whether or not they think the information provided is satisfactory. Have students come up with a list of questions they have about the Chinese Exclusion Act.
Day 3 � Taking Action
Every year on May 10, the Golden Spike Foundation commemorates the coming together of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads to create the Transcontinental Railroad. Every year, there is little to no representation of the Chinese laborers who have built the central pacific railroad. With your group, brainstorm a list of ways that the committee could recognize the contributions of Chinese laborers and how they can increase awareness of their contributions. Then, compose a professional, persuasive letter to the committee that explains why the Chinese contributions to the railroad should be recognized and how that can be achieved. Include concrete information from the resources you have examined over the course of this lesson, including specific quotes and examples.
Address your letter to the Golden Spike Foundation, 60 South 600 East, Suite 150, Salt Lake City, Utah 84102.

Native American and Indigenous Studies
Sample Lesson 11: Native American Mascots
Theme: Identity
Disciplinary Area: Native American and Indigenous Studies
Standards Alignment:
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.11�12.1, 2, 7; WHST.11�12.1, 4
Lesson Purpose and Overview: Students will examine past and present historical portrayals of Native American iconography and culture used as mascots for major U.S. sports teams. Students will explore and discuss how mascots can be viewed as negative or prideful. Students will have an opportunity to read and analyze various articles and sources on the topic and determine if the use of Native American mascots should be continued or banned.
Key Terms and Concepts: Stereotypes, Colonialism, Disenfranchisement, Hegemony
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Understand the historical context of Native American iconography and symbolism used in American sports and popular culture.
2. Compare and contrast differing arguments around the debate on the use of Native American iconography and symbolism within American sports.
3. Analyze why some sports teams have opted to change their mascots and/or nicknames from Native American figures, and why others have not. Students will document potential social, economic, legislative, and historic factors that have contributed to these decisions.
Essential Questions:
425

1. How have Native Americans in the U.S. historically been portrayed by nonindigenous peoples?
2. How has the use of Native American iconography, imagery, and culture by nonindigenous peoples impacted Native Americans today?
3. Should sports teams continue to use these mascots? Use evidence from the texts and documents you have analyzed to support your claim.
Lesson Steps:
Day 1
1. Introduce the lesson by writing the following on the board: "Why are Native American mascots considered offensive by some but considered prideful to others?" Have students respond to this question on a sheet of paper. After completing their written responses, have each student share their work with a neighbor. After allowing about three to five minutes for the pairs to share, have a whole class discussion responding to the question.
2. Ask two students to come to the board and list sports teams that use Native American imagery, iconography, or cultural traits as part of their mascots, team names, or nicknames. Below is a sample list just in case students struggle to identify some teams: 1. Atlanta Braves 2. Kansas City Chiefs 3. The former Washington Redskins 4. Florida State Seminoles 5. Chicago Blackhawks 6. Cleveland Indians 7. San Diego State Aztecs
3. After drafting the list, project some images of the mascots, logos, etc. on the other side of the board. Feel free to use some of the images provided above. Again, ask students if they find the images to be disrespectful.
426

4. Ask students if they are aware of the Washington Redskins name change. Ask students to share what they have heard about the decision to rename the team, including the reasons for the change, how people responded to the change, and what events preceded and coincided with the decision (for example, BLM, the decision to remove Confederate statues, the decision to remove statues of Christopher Columbus and the push to rename the city of Columbus, Ohio, as well as other relevant events). If time permits, a news clip, article, or headlines can be shown to students.
5. After projecting the images, show the following video clips of the Florida State Seminoles pre-game ceremony performed by Chief Osceola Renegade, as well as a clip of the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Braves Tomahawk chop. Ask that student take notes on the videos and reflect on the earlier questions.
a. Florida State Seminoles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J20wsKNV0NI
b. Kansas City Chiefs Tomahawk chop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4P6z_DTHf8
c. Atlanta Braves Tomahawk chop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bN7f4AlaGM
6. Hand out a copy of the NPR article, "Are You Ready for Some Controversy?" and have students read it in class. Ask students to also respond to the following questions: 1. What do those who refuse to say the name "Redskin" call the team? 2. What media outlets have protested the use of the name Redskins? 3. When was the term "Redskin" first recorded, and whom was it used by? Why was it used? 4. How did Earl Edmonds' book, "Redskins Rime" portray Native Americans and the name Redskin?
427

5. What did the Washington Redskins owner say about the possibility of changing the name?
7. Provide students with two additional NPR articles "After Mounting Pressure, Washington's NFL Franchise Drops Its Team Name" and "Washington NFL Team's Sponsor FedEx Formally Asks For Team Name Change" and have students respond to the following questions. If there is not enough time in class, this can be assigned for homework. 1. How long after the first article was the second article written? The third article? 2. What events took place during that time? What prompted the decision to change the name? How have attitudes about the name changed over time?
Day 2
1. Start the second day of the lesson by asking students to pull out their homework. Ask the student to discuss their answers with a neighbor. After about five minutes of discussion be sure to collect the homework assignment.
2. First play commercial "Proud to Be"- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRtbOxlhvE. Next, play "Redskins is a Powerful Name"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SFqadRTQ0
3. Ask students to identify the differences between these two videos. Discuss in pairs and later as a whole class. Also ask students, "Is there a difference between what Chief Osceola Renegade does at the beginning of Florida State University's games versus what occurs at the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Braves games?
4. If time permits, have student research the Florida State University's relationship with the Seminole tribe. This can also be assigned as homework. As a starting point, have students review the website listed below: 1. Seminole Tribe of Florida Website- https://www.semtribe.com/stof
428

2. "Relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida"https://unicomm.fsu.edu/messages/relationship-seminole-tribe-florida/
3. National Congress of Indian Americans. "Anti-Defamation & Mascots"http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamationmascots
Day 3
1. Start the day by having students report back what they learned from the homework assignment to the whole class.
2. Ask students if there are any sports teams that have removed/retired Native American mascots or names. If students are unable to respond to the question, emphasize that the following teams and/or institutions have removed or retired the use Native American imagery from their sports teams marketing: Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the Golden State Warriors, the University of Oklahoma, Marquette University, Marquette University, Dartmouth College, Syracuse University, Coachella Valley High School, and Fremont High School in Sunnyvale. Provide some images of the retired mascots for additional reference. Two examples are included below.
3. Show an excerpt of the film "In Whose Honor"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lUF95ThI7s
4. After watching the film, have students complete the handout provided below. 5. After completing the handout, have students share their answers with each other
in pairs.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the California Arts Education Framework:
The History�Social Science Framework (chapter 20) and the California Arts Framework (chapter 7) both include a discussion of culturally responsive teaching/pedagogy. These sections could add insight to this lesson, which is about how cultural symbols can be
429

appropriated by an outside culture without regard for the potential impact upon those affected by that appropriation.
Possible discussion questions that you can use to explore this topic include:
� How has your culture been portrayed in the U.S. media? How is that similar or different to the portrayal of Native Americans?
� How has the use of your culture's iconography, imagery, and culture impacted your community/culture?
� How can we combat the perpetuation of stereotypes and cultural appropriation in today's media?
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will conduct research on the history of Native American iconography, culture, and imagery being used in the marketing of U.S. sports teams.
 Students will engage in class dialogue and debate around the highly contentious topic.
 Students will have several opportunities to reflect on the differing positions of Native American tribes related to this topic.

CA ELD Standards: ELD PI. 9�10. 1, 2, 5, 9, 10b.
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson will introduce students to Native American and Mexican cuisine, with a focus on planting, indigenous Mexican ingredients, the four periods of Native American cuisine, and Mexican cookery. Students will learn about biodiversity and how to "decolonize your diet". Before introducing this lesson, it is recommended that the teacher research and introduce students to the history of Native American tribes nearby and in the region where their school is located. In addition to exposing students to Native American and Mexican diets, this lesson will help students understand how these two foodways and cultures are connected.
Key Terms and Concepts: foodways, colonialism, decolonization, biodiversity, wellbalanced diet, talking circles.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Develop an understanding of Native American and Mexican American culture, and draw links between the two through the lens of food.
2. Research and develop an activity that will demonstrate their understanding of a Native American cultural practice, like growing indigenous plants and cooking traditional Native American and Mexican foods that can be shared with their peers, families, and respective communities.
Essential Questions:
1. What does it mean to "decolonize your diet"? 2. How has colonialism impacted Mexican and Native American foodways?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1
433

1. Ask students to pull out a sheet of paper for a quick free writing exercise. Instruct students to write down some cultural food dishes specific to their backgrounds. Also ask students to write what comes to mind when they think about Native American food.
2. After giving the students about three to five minutes to respond to the prompts, ask students to share some of their responses aloud. After everyone has shared their responses, begin to introduce the Native American food tradition of the "Three Sisters". Explain that the "Three Sisters" are corn, beans, and squash, which represent some of the most important crops to Native Americans broadly. These crops provide a well-balanced diet--carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and amino acids, can be planted together (companion planting), and can be stored for long periods of time when dried. Teachers should also show some images of traditional Native American dishes that can be made with the "Three Sisters."
3. Following the introduction to the "Three Sisters", play the video "Why You Must Try Native American Cuisine" and ask students to write down any vocabulary words that they might be unfamiliar with and to take notes. After watching the film, have students use the duration of the class period to read and annotate the vignette below. Before closing out for the day, explain that tomorrow the class will engage in a "talking circle," where they will have a conversation about Native American and Mexican food and how to "decolonize your diet." Instruct students to come prepared with at least two guiding questions for discussion.
4. Close with student and community reflection on the film.
Day 2
1. If the teacher is familiar with community circles the following activity is recommended:
a. Start by having students arrange their chairs into a circle.
434

b. Explain that talking circles have historically been facilitated by some Native American tribes to reflect, problem-solve, grieve, brainstorm, or just come together to build community.
i. Also note that some circles will often use an object to represent a talking piece to help facilitate discussion--whoever has the talking piece is the only person allowed to speak. Instead of using a talking piece, ask students to respect the rule--one mic, one voice.
ii. Ideally the class should have created a list of community agreements at the start of the year, if you have not, it is recommended that you create some in collaboration with your students for this discussion.
2. Have students take turns asking and responding to guiding questions. Also create a list of your own guiding questions that you can use to support students through the talking circle discussion. If the teacher is not familiar with talking circles, the guiding questions can be done in collaborative groups, as a whole class discussion or individual writing prompts.
3. Guiding Questions:
a. What are the four periods of Native American cuisine?
b. What does decolonize mean?
c. How can you decolonize your diet?
d. What are the "magic eight"?
e. How is Native American cuisine connected to current zero-waste and vegan/plant-based movements?
f. What do traditional Mexican and Native American foodways have in common? How are they different?
435

g. How did colonialism directly impact health inequities amongst Native American tribes?
h. What is a food desert? How does living in a food desert affect community health?
i. What is biodiversity?
4. After about 25-30 minutes of discussion, introduce a new project for the students. Design a cultural production assignment that will be showcased for parents and the school community to see/experience. Students are given the option of producing one of the following (note � students with no access to resources should be provided with an alternate cultural assignment):
a. Cook: Research at least five different Native American recipes across the four periods of Native American cuisine. Have students research in depth the history of the food ingredients and the history of the tribes that harvested the ingredients. After studying the various ingredients and recipe steps, work to create your own Native American-inspired dish. Each student will be responsible for creating a dish that can serve (small appetizer portions) at least 20 people. In addition to making the dish, each student will need to create 20 recipe cards listing the steps, ingredients, and a brief chef's statement explaining the significance of the dish. Alternatively, if students are not allowed to bring prepared foods to school, students could record a cooking-show style video preparing a dish dishes, compile a cookbook (digital or print) that includes photos of dishes they made, or create a menu of dishes (appetizers, main, dessert) that can be shown or displayed.
b. Grow: Beyond the "Three Sisters" and "magic eight" identify at least five other herbs, vegetables, and/or grains significant to Native American or Mexican cuisine. Write a brief report on these ingredients identifying where they are commonly grown, how they are used, how they are planted, and their significance (if any) to specific Native American tribes. In addition to the
436

report, students will grow their own mini gardens. Each student will grow at least one herb and/or vegetable. Students should try to plant items that grow best during the current season, use seeds, and plant in an easily portable pot.
c. Learn: Research at least five different Native American recipes across the four periods of Native American cuisine or traditional Mexican recipes. Arrange a time to share what you have learned with an elder or the primary cook in your family. In addition to sharing these recipes, each student will also conduct a brief interview with the person they identified. Students are expected to come up with at least four questions to ask their interviewee, they should address the following: their family member's style of cooking, favorite recipes, cooking memories, etc. Each interview must include the interviewee sharing a family recipe. These interviews should be video recorded and the final video should be no more than three to five minutes.
5. After explaining the three cultural production assignment options, students use the remainder of their time to begin brainstorming and outlining their projects. Provide students time in class to complete the assignment for the next week. For the community event, the students all bring in their cultural production assignments to showcase. Have students line their plants up on a shelf in the rear of the room. The video interviews are playing on a loop via the classroom projector. And "tasting stations" are setup around the room for parents and guests to sample some of the dishes that were made.
6. Close with student, parent, and community reflection.
Making Connections to the Health Education Framework:
Review the Nutrition and Physical Activity section in Chapter 6 of the framework, which addresses the Health Education Standards for high school. This section includes a Learning Activity where students critique their personal diet for overall balance of key nutrients. How does the nutritional benefits of the diet addressed in this ethnic studies lesson compare to the contemporary diets of most Americans?
437

Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will respond to writing prompts that will demonstrate understanding of Native American and traditional Mexican cuisine and diet.
 Students will generate discussion questions that will help facilitate a dialogue about Native American cuisine and diet.
 Students can start a school campaign to include Native American and Mexican cuisine into their school lunch menu.

Vignette: Decolonize Your Diet: Plant-Based Mexican American Recipes for Health and Healing
In 1521, Spanish conquistadores, led by Hern�n Cort�s, conquered the city of Tenochtitl�n, the capital and religious center of the Mexica (Aztec) empire. Over the ensuing centuries, millions of indigenous peoples were killed or died of disease brought by the colonizers. Many indigenous people were forced to convert to Christianity. Some foods, such as amaranth in Mesoamerica and quinoa in the Andes, were outlawed because of their use in indigenous religious ceremonies. At the time of the Conquest, there were hundreds of indigenous groups, each with distinct languages, religious beliefs, and cultures. In the area that is now Mexico, in addition to the Mexica (Aztec) there were Mxtec, Zapotec, Maya, Pur�pecha, Otomi, Huichol, Tarahumara, Yaqui, Seri, O'odham, and many others. Over time, Spanish colonizers gained control of the land and resources of most of these indigenous groups, often through violent exertions of power. Because they were the most powerful group in Mesoamerica, there are many resources about the Mexica culture at the time of the Conquest, and through study, we can learn quite a bit about their food, ceremonies, and social organization. Other indigenous groups keep this information through oral tradition, and it is not as widely known or recoverable to those of us not connected to our ancestors...
We believe that indigenous cultural traditions in religion, art, music, literature, and food were never completely suppressed by the colonizers but kept alive, sometimes surreptitiously, through daily acts of storytelling, cooking, and prayer. In a Chicana/o context, one important site of this maintenance of indigenous knowledge and culture is the tradition of passing down recipes from generation to generation. Learning to make a corn tortilla or preparing a pot of tamales are practices that have been sustained for more than a thousand years. That we still engage in these practices today is a testament to our ancestors and their extraordinary knowledge about food.
Both of us [authors] have grandparents who spoke fondly of finding and preparing quelites (lamb's quarters) and verdolagas (purslane). Quelites comes from the N�huatl word quelitl, meaning edible wild green. Technically, verdologas are also wild green and
439

thus a subset of the larger group of quelites; however, in the US Southwest, our grandparent used the word quelites to refer specifically to lamb's quarters. Verdologas (Portulaca olera-cea) is often said to have originated in North Africa and the Middle East; however, there is considerable archeological evidence of its presence in the Americas before colonization. One type of lamb's quarters (Chenopodium berlandieri) is native to the Americas and closely related to quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa). Another type of lamb's quarters is Chenopodium album, which is native to Europe and Asia. Throughout the world, agribusiness considers both quelites and verdolagas to be weeds and uses herbicides, such as Monsanto's Roundup, to try to kill these nutritious plants.
Global food activist Vandana Shiva critiques the single-minded corporate worldview that favors the eradication of biodiversity and modification of all nature into plantations for profit. She argues, "Not being commercially useful, people's crops [indigenous foods grown in indigenous ways] are treated as `weeds' and destroyed with poisons. The most extreme example of this destruction is that of bathua (Chenopodium album) an important green leafy vegetable, with a very high nutritive value and rich in Vitamin A." This bathua, regarded as a pernicious weed and a threat to commercial wheat crops, is the wild green our grandparents called quelites. Shiva brings attention to the horrific inhumanity of using weed killers on wild crops: "Forty thousand children in India go blind each year for lack of Vitamin A, and herbicides contribute to this tragedy by destroying the freely available sources of Vitamin A [bathua]"...
Real food has, for many of us and in many ways, become unrecognizable as such. Most Americans do not eat a plant-based diet with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Instead, North Americans consume a lot of sugary, fried, or fake foods like sodas, energy drinks, chips and other bagged snacks, candy bars, and cookies which contain considerable amounts of high fructose corn syrup, sugar and artificial sweeteners, corn and soybean oils, and sodium. The average American eats 156 pounds (seventy-one kg) of added sugar every year. Not only are Americans eating these foods, they are eating more of them: per person we're now eating 750 more calories per day than we consumed thirty years ago. There are multiple factors that influence the dismal eating habits of many Americans. These include lack of access to
440

healthy, fresh foods, which is a particular problem in working-class communities of color; easy access to fast food and junk food; advertising campaigns for sodas, fast food, and junk food that target youth; and agricultural subsidies that make processed and fake foods cheap and accessible.
Unlike immigrant Latinas/os who grew up with ready access to fresh foods grown and produced on small local farms, many US-born Latinas/os have never ever tasted real food. One study on immigrant diets found that Latinas who brought fresh food from street markets in the US reported that the food in their home countries was tastier, fresher, and "more natural." For US Latina/o communities, the Standard American Diet has been imposed through Americanization programs, school lunch programs, targeted advertising campaigns and national food policies. Our communities are now riddled with the diseases of development--diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and some cancers.
While we believe that individuals, families, and communities can take concrete steps to decolonize their diets by reintroducing traditional and ancestral foods, we recognize that a true solution to this problem will entail radical structural changes to the way food is produced, distributed, and consumed both in the US and globally. As we join others in calling for an end to the Standard American Diet of over-processed foods, we also want to challenge the language that frames questions of health and diet as problems related only to individual's "choices." This focus on the individual is especially pronounced in popular discussions of obesity. Although obesity is classified as a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers, the relationship between weight and disease is quite complex. It is important to keep in mind that there are healthy and unhealthy people in all weight categories: underweight "normal" weight, and overweight. We think the public focus on obesity makes it too easy to demonize individual fat people without seriously engaging with the social policies that are corrupting our food supply and in turn, our health. A cultural obsession with being thin does not help our understanding of what it means to be healthy.

Sample Lesson 13: Develop or Preserve? The Shellmound Sacred Site Struggle
Theme: Social Movements and Equity
Disciplinary Area: Native American and Indigenous Studies
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 4; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 1, 2, 4; Historical Interpretation 1, 5.
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 4, 6, 9; WHST. 9�10.1, 4, 5, 6, 7.
CA ELD Standards: ELD PI.9�10. 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11.
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson exposes students to a highly contentious and ongoing debate around Native American sacred sites. Students will be introduced to the history of the Ohlone people, the significance of shellmounds, and ongoing protests that have been organized to protect sacred sites. Students will engage sources that both support the preservation of these sites and those that are in favor of development. Finally, students will develop a persuasive essay where they are able to offer their own opinion on the issue supported by primary and secondary source research.
Key Terms and Concepts: marginalization, sacred sites, shellmounds, preservation, repatriation
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...): 1. Learn about the significance of shellmounds and sacred sites for Native Americans, specifically for the Ohlone people.
442

2. Analyze how redevelopment and gentrification further settler colonial practices and violate the sovereignty of indigenous lands and sacred sites.
Essential Questions:
1. Should indigenous lands and sacred sites be saved and protected? If so, what are the challenges in doing so?
2. Who should determine what happens to indigenous lands and sacred sites?
3. What should be done to reclaim and restore sacred lands?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
*Lesson Note: This lesson focuses on the San Francisco Bay Area, but can be adapted to highlight a number of sacred sites that are currently or have been a space of contention. For example, a similar lesson on the Puvungna burial site located at California State University, Long Beach or the Standing Rock Movement, would also introduce students to contemporary debates and struggles regarding the use of sacred lands.
Day 1
1. Begin with a community building activity (5-10 minutes). A sample list of community building activities is provided in the appendix.
2. Engage the class by asking how many students have shopped or visited the movie theater at the Emeryville Bay Street Mall. While students briefly discuss their experiences at Bay Street Mall, project a current image of the mall next to a 1924 image of the Emeryville Shellmound.
3. Explain to the students that the second image depicts what parts of Berkeley and Emeryville looked like prior to development, specifically noting that the Bay Street Mall was constructed atop of one of the largest shellmound sites in the area. Mention that shellmounds often served as burial grounds and sacred sites where
443

Ohlone people would meet for rituals and traditions thousands of years before the formation of the United States. Point out that there was once over 400 shellmounds all around the San Francisco Bay Area, making the region part of the Ohlone people's sacred geography. 4. As a class, read aloud a local news article, "Emeryville: Filmmaker tells story of forgotten Indian burial ground disrupted by quest for retail". After reading the article, screen two short videos, "A New Vision for the West Berkeley Shellmound" and "The Shellmound: Berkeley's Native Monument." Prior to screening the videos remind students to be attentive and take notes. 5. After screening the videos, ask students to define the following terms in their own words: shellmound, monument, sacred geography, burial grounds, development, and repatriation, using context clues from the sources they recently read and watched. After taking five minutes to define the terms on their own, have students talk through each term aloud.
Day 2
1. After reviewing the previous day's discussion, divide the class into four groups and ask them to respond to the following questions: 1. What is the significance of shellmounds and land in the Berkeley/Emeryville area to the Ohlone people? 2. Why are the West Berkeley and Bay Street sites highly sought after by non-Native American groups? 3. How does the struggle for shellmounds intersect with environmental issues in the region? 4. Do you think places where shellmounds are or once stood should be preserved? 5. Are there any sacred or historical sites that members in your community and/or family revere? If so, please share with the group.
444

2. After allowing the groups to discuss the five reflection questions for fifteen to twenty minutes, provide a few minutes for the class to come together and debrief what was discussed in groups.
Day 3
1. Continue the third day of class by introducing a new assignment. Have students conduct research on both sides (the position of the Ohlone people and those in support of further developing the area) of the Berkeley/Emeryville Shellmound struggle and write a persuasive essay in response to the essential question based on the evidence they have gathered, class discussions, and their own observations and insights. The persuasive essay should be assigned as homework; however, students should be provided ample time in class over the next three days to conduct research, draft an outline and thesis statement, and have their work peer-reviewed.
2. For additional guidance, create a grading rubric for the persuasive essay, compile a brief list of recommended sources, and let students know that their essays must include the following: 1. Your persuasive essay must be five paragraphs (introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion), be typed in 12 point times new roman font, and include a bibliography listing at least four sources (scholarly and credible) in MLA format. 2. Your persuasive essay must have a well-conceived thesis statement that includes your three major talking points/arguments. 3. Each of your talking points/arguments must be supported with evidence. 4. Your essay should be well organized and include rhetorical devices.
3. After a week, students should submit their persuasive essays in class. Provide each student with a 3x5 index card where they are tasked with writing down their three talking points/arguments. After everyone has finished filling out their index card, have students form groups of 3 � 5 students. Group members should take turns sharing their talking points. When all students have shared, they should
445

collectively decide what their three or four strongest points are, create a thesis statement based on those points, and select one group representative to share their points with the class. Group members should help their representative write a short (two to three-minute) explanation that includes a thesis statement and their key points.

Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework discusses a number of civil rights movements that were created in response to political, economic, and social discrimination. Teachers can build upon the example of the struggle to preserve the shellmound sites and have students compare that to some of the other movements referenced in the framework, such as the 1969�1971 occupation of Alcatraz or the American Indian Movement's 1972�73 standoff at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This lesson can also be connected to the Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement lesson.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will conduct research on Native American sacred lands. They will analyze the positions of both the Ohlone people and developers in the ongoing movement around sacred sites.
 Students will write a five paragraph essay detailing the significance of these sites as well as the social, cultural, and environmental impact of development on and near sacred sites. They will also present their research findings and arguments to the class.
 Students may also present findings to local leaders and participate in the discussions about local land use and the protection of sacred sites.

Pacific Islanders in the United States
Sample Lesson: Historical and Contemporary Experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States
Theme: History and Movement, Identity
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Principles Alignment: 1. Celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of color by providing a space to share their stories of struggle and resistance, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth. 2. Center and place high value on the pre-colonial, ancestral knowledge of Native people/s and people of color that is typically marginalized in society. 3. Critique empire-building in history and its relationship to white supremacy, racism and other forms of power and oppression. 4. Challenge imperialist/colonial beliefs and practices on multiple levels.
Standards Alignment:
� CCSS ELA: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 6, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1, SL.11�12.4
� HSS: 11.4.2
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson is designed to be an introduction to the study of people of Pacific Islander descent in the United States, while drawing connections to the Pacific Islands and the Pacific Island diaspora more broadly. Pacific Islanders in the United States are often left out of conversations
458

about communities of color in America. The purpose of this lesson is to understand the ways in which American expansion in the Pacific since the 1800s has grown and created a variety of issues among growing Pacific Islander communities in Oceania and in the U.S. today. This lesson will use geography, data aggregation, and narratives to explore the U.S. experiences of Pacific Islanders from Guam, American Samoa, Palau, Marshall Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. This lesson is designed to be an introduction to the study of Pacific Islander migrations to the continental United States, including the history, culture, and politics of Hawai'i and U.S. Pacific territories.
Key Terms and Concepts: Pacific Islanders, race, annexation, migration, militarization, citizenship, Oceania, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, data disaggregation, Census
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Identify varying experiences of Pacific Islanders in relation to the United States 2. Analyze differences and similarities between Pacific Islander experiences and history 3. Explore the relationships between colonialism, citizenship, and identity
Essential Questions:
1. Who are Pacific Islanders in the United States? What is their history with immigration and settlement?
2. What systems, structures and events have contributed to the racialization of Pacific Islanders in the US? Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data to understand the Pacific Islander population?
3. What are the contemporary experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States? How do they respond to discrimination and displacement?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day One: Pacific Islander Immigration to the U.S.
Who are Pacific Islanders in the United States? What is their history with immigration and settlement?
1. Students will write down seven words that describe their identity that will be shared later in the lesson.
2. Teacher displays an example of a world map. 3. Teacher will lead a discussion by asking the following questions, writing down student
responses:
a. What are maps and what do they tell us?
459

b. Who and what gets left out of understanding people through maps?
c. What do maps tell us about who created them?
Teacher notes: ex: borders, boundaries, difference, power, etc.
4. Students will answer the question, "How might maps connect to the seven words you chose?" on a piece of paper and then share out to class.
5. Teacher shares examples of maps of the Pacific Islands and explains:
a. The Pacific includes 1200 distinct cultural groups among 7�10 million people living in and around the world's largest and oldest ocean, in some of the world's most vulnerable and precious ecosystems. These groups maintain their respective cultural, political, familial knowledge systems under categories known as Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia (http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/sites/default/files/styles/cartogis_700x700/ public/maps/bitmap/standard/2019/06/00341_Micro%2CMela%2C%20Polynesia.png?itok=0aGPnngd). However, when encountering the U.S. � they are defined by their relationships with maps, borders, and American empire in the Pacific.
Teacher notes:
� Melanesia: Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji
� Micronesia: Guam, Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae), Kiribati, Nauru, Marshall Islands, and Palau Polynesia: Hawaiian Islands, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Niue, Easter Island, Pitcairn, Norfolk, and New Zealand
6. Teacher displays and explains the "U.S. Immigration Status by Pacific Island Birth" infographic, which shows the varying U.S. immigration statuses of Pacific Islanders that continue to shift over time.
7. Students will share observations of the graphic, while answering the following question: "What do you immediately recognize about the different statuses?"

8. Teacher passes out a worksheet and explains each short write up prior to viewing each video, while students follow along.
a. U.S. Citizens: Hawai'i
i. Hawai'i was colonized by Euro-American capitalists and missionaries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1893 Americans invaded, overthrew Indigenous peoples, and secured an all-white planter oligarchy in place of reigning ali'i (nobility), Queen Lili'uokalani - which led to annexation in 1898. This included dispossession of the Hawaiian government, lands, and citizenship that colonized Indigenous Hawaiians.
ii. Students watch a clip of Act of War (21:45-36:25) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBmrPH1sNqg&t=2917s) and write down 7�10 explicit details/facts from the video. Teachers can also provide the full documentary online for the students to watch outside of class.
b. Compact of Free Association: Marshall Islands
i. In 1946, the United States started testing nuclear bombs in the Marshall Islands under the codename Operation Crossroads. To clear the way for the tests, the US Navy negotiated with leaders of Bikini Atoll to move 167 residents east to Rongerik Atoll--a move that Bikinians understood as temporary and believed would be "for the good of mankind." When Rongerik's food supply proved insufficient to support the population, the US relocated the Bikinians to Kwajalein Atoll and finally to Kile Island. On Kile, Bikinians faced numerous challenges including insufficient food supplies, lack of fishing grounds, drought, typhoons, dependence on canned food supplied by the US Department of Agriculture, and accompanying health problems (e.g., high blood pressure and diabetes).
ii. Students watch Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner - Anointed (0:00-6:08) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVpExaY2Fs) and write down 5�7 explicit details/facts from the video.
c. U.S. Nationals: American Samoa
i. In the 1890s - Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were locked in a dispute over who should have control
461

over the Samoan islands. In 1899, these countries came to an agreement where the Germans had influence in the eastern islands, and the U.S. would maintain influence in the eastern islands. The U.S. Navy wanted to utilize Pago Pago Harbor as a coaling site for their ships, which also became key during World War II until the closing of the base in 1951.
ii. Teachers can have students watch the first ten minutes of the 1978 film Omai Fa'atasi by Takashi Fuji and write down 7�10 explicit details/facts from the video.
9. Using examples from the lecture and videos, students will work in groups to complete the worksheet and provide an analysis of American influence in the Pacific.
10. As a class, each group will share their reflections and answers to: What does this tell us about "American expansion" in the Pacific? How might this impact migration to the U.S.?
Extension Assignment:
Teachers can assign an essay that utilizes the information on the worksheet to write about the impact of American expansion on the Pacific Islanders.
Day Two: Analyzing Racialization of Pacific Islanders through Data
What systems, structures and events have contributed to the racialization of Pacific Islanders in the US? Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data on the Pacific Islander population?
1. Teacher begins with a group discussion.
a. Teacher asks: What is a Pacific Islander? Who is a Pacific Islander? Is it one group or many groups?
b. In this lesson, we are going to learn that this broad label is composed of many groups, and we are going to analyze what has contributed to this label and what are the outcomes of only relying on this label.
Teacher notes:
� The poverty rate of Pacific Islanders is 20% vs. 12% of the general population.
� Pacific Islanders are half as likely to have a bachelor's degree in comparison with 27% for the total population and 49% of Asian Americans.
462

� Bachelor degree attainment rate is 69.1% for Asian Indians whereas only 9.4% for Samoans.
� This data shows there is a large difference between the Pacific Islander community and the general and Asian American community.
� It is important to disaggregate the data to identify the needs of the Pacific Islander community.
� This shows there is a need for more services and programs for the Pacific Islander community, i.e. to get into and graduate from college.
� By lumping Pacific Islanders under Asian Americans, Pacific Islander issues become invisible.
2. Students read and analyze the following sources:
a. What Census Calls Us: A Historical Timeline
b. Excerpt of Community of Contrasts - Executive Summary and Demographics (510)
c. The State of Higher Education in California
3. Teacher will pass out the worksheet "The Disaggregation of Pacific Islander Data" which has a number of content questions. Students can work in pairs or in groups to help each other answer the questions.
4. Before students answer the last question from the worksheet and write their paragraph, have a class discussion on what they have learned. Ask the question: How have racial categories impacted Pacific Islanders? Provide 1 example. Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data on the Pacific Islander population?
Extension Assignment:
The handout and paragraph can develop into a larger assignment that uses data disaggregation to do a report on Pacific Islanders. This report can be an infographic or in essay form. This can also lead in a Youth Participatory Action Research project that provides students an opportunity to do more research on Pacific Islander communities. This could consist of interviews and oral histories. This could potentially add to the growing research on Pacific Islanders.
Day Three: Contemporary Pacific Islander Experiences
463

What are the contemporary experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States? How do they use storytelling to share about these experiences and reframe dominant narratives about Pacific Islanders?
1. Students will draw two images, side by side, showing 1) How they think the world/society views them and 2) Who they really are. Students will share and explain their drawings.
2. Students will review the following narratives to read/hear examples of Pacific peoples stories on contemporary issues of land displacement, climate change and movements for independence.
a. Standing Above the Clouds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peDRsxYaF1U) - short documentary b. Frontline Truths by the Pacific Climate Warriors (https://350.org/frontline-truths/) first person narratives of Climate Justice Warriors 3. Students will create "I Am" poems to share:
a. For each of the items, write 3-5 things that answer each item about you. Use the list to create a poem which repeats the line, "I am from..." followed by your lists. Be creative.
i. Items commonly found around your home or yard growing up
ii. Events that changed your life
iii. Names of relatives, especially ones that link you to your past
iv. Names of food and dishes that are always at family gatherings
v. Places important to you
vi. Saying and beliefs repeated often in your family
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
Assessment: The summative assessment has three parts in this lesson. Part 1: An essay on the impact on American expansion on the immigration of Pacific Islanders. Part 2: Data analysis infographic. Part 3: "I Am" poem. These three parts come together to both build the analytical skills of the students and also provide direct opportunities for them to connect to the lesson.
464

Application: Students will apply the ethnic studies principles to their essay, data analysis, and poems.
Action: Students can do a number of things with what they learned. First, they can use the material to analyze immigration policy that is important today. The teacher can include an extension activity that can compare Pacific Islander immigration with immigration of other Asian American groups. These immigration patterns and trends can be connected back to American expansion and imperialism. Another option is having students choose another racialized group and compare their experiences to Pacific Islanders. The teacher could also have students apply the content and skills of this lesson to develop a more robust Youth Participatory Action Research Project to learn more about Pacific Islanders by conducting interviews or collecting oral histories with community members. This could contribute to the growing research and literature on Pacific Islanders.
Reflection: Students will use the "I Am From" poems to reflect on how the lesson on Pacific Islanders connects to their own lives.

In 1946, The United States started testing nuclear bombs in the Marshall Islands under the codename Operation Crossroads. To clear the way for the tests, the US Navy negotiated with leaders of Bikini Atoll to move 167 residents east to Rongerik Atoll-a move that Bikinians understood as temporary and believed would be "for the good of mankind." When Rongerik's food supply proved insufficient to support the population, the US relocated the Bikinians to Kwajalein Atoll and finally to Kile Island. On Kile, Bikinians faced numerous challenges including insufficient food supplies, lack of fishing grounds, drought, typhoons, dependence on canned food supplied by the US Department of Agriculture, and accompanying health problems (e.g., high blood pressure and diabetes).

3. AMERICAN SAMOA � U.S. Nationals
In the 1890s � Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were locked in a dispute over who should have control over the Samoan islands. In 1899, these countries came to an agreement where the Germans had influence in the eastern islands, and the U.S. would maintain influence in the eastern islands. The U.S. Navy wanted to utilize Pago Pago Harbor as a coaling site for their ships, which also became key during World War II.
