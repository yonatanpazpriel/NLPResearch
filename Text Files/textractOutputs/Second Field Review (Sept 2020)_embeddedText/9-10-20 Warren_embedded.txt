There's hella studies on Asian Americans how well students are doing, their socio economic status, generational wealth, etc. The term Asian American hubs an umbrella of cultures from Hmong, Khmer, Pinoy, Chinese, Pakistani, Vietnamese, etc. A common thing we see these days is AA / PI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) This is harmful to the Pacific Islander community because P.I is a hub of cultures in itself from Chamorro, Tongan, Samoan, Fijians, Samoan peoples. PI studies in California will lay the foundation for PI students to engage in their history and build wealth in their communities or participate in movements for the liberation of their peoples. As a Filipina American student thats what learning my history has done for me. I can guarantee it will benefit not only PI students, but their entire communities for generations to come.
I urge the IQC to implement Arab American studies WITH the stories of Palestinians as well. This is so important for our communities to know about who Palestinians are especially in a post 9/11 society. Especially with the war that is taking place. I did not realize that the neighbors on my block who own the corner store are Palestinian my whole life. These people are a big part in our communities and I did not even know about their ethnicity until after highschool. Not teaching Palestinian history is dishonorable to the people who serve our country in everyday working class jobs. They are very much apart of the American experience and deserve to have their histories taught in public education. It is a right !!
