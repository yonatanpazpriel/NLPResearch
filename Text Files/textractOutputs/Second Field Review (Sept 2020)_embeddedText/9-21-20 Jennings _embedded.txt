From: Stephanie Sent: Monday, September 21, 2020 3:53 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American studies
Please make sure that the ethnic studies program includes all the voices in California and not exclude any. The importance of the Arab American community included in Asian studies cannot be overstated.
Arab Americans have been a part of the fabric of California since state hood. Their story and their voice cannot be excluded in an ethnic studies program. Their experience is essential to presenting the full California experience.
Please don't deny another generation of students the rights to study and hear the voices of all Californians.
Sincerely, Stephanie Jennings San Diego, California
