From: kimberly chortek Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed Ethnic Studies Curricula for State of California
Thank you for your work on this very important topic. I support the inclusion of age-appropriate ethnic studies in the K-12 curriculum in California and look forward to its incorporation in the education of our youth.
The fact that the first draft contained anti-semitic/derogatory language referring to Jews and Judaism is proof that anti-semitism sadly flourishes in our country and even in a state as progressive as California.
I appreciate that the offensive language was removed from the first draft and that you have recognized the many forms of bigotry and hatred that affect both peoples of color based on race as well as religious identity (along with the other intersectionality of community/identities) that are referenced in the current draft.
I would suggest that the draft curricula on Ethnic Studies include a sample lesson that clearly defines the word antisemitism, with meaningful examples of the acts. This should be accompanied by questions designed to explore why bigotry and hatred of religious groups, specifically populated by Jewish people, continue to thrive and grow stronger in California and in the U.S.
The curricula should also recognize the diversity and many faces of those in the Jewish faith-- including those from the Middle East, Northern Africa and other Jews of color.
As emphasized in the Model Curricula, the education should build bridges between all students by fostering understanding and appreciating the life experiences of others. This education would not be complete without the lessons relating to intersectionality identity.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment.
Best, Kim Chortek
