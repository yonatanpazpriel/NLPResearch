Dear IQC Members, I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I urge you to revise the ESMC to accurately represent Jewish American experiences, teach about antisemitism in all its forms, add an inclusive unit on Middle Eastern communities featuring JIMENA's lesson plan, and remove guiding values and principles which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
