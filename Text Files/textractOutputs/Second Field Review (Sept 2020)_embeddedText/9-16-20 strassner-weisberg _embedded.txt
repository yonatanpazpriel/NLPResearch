To whom it may concern:
Having a required ethnic studies curriculum is important, however, allowing political interests to manipulate the curriculum to diminish a minority defeats the purpose of the curriculum.
1. Why doesn't the curriculum include broad Jewish American experiences about anti-Semitism so that students can understand what anti-Semitism is and that it is hateful? At my child's local public school kids drew hidden swastikas on their hands (showing them when teachers weren't looking), wore clothes from a heinous line of clothing that has hidden swastikas, did a Hitler salute when they saw Jews, made anti-semitic jokes and wished a child's family had been killed in the Holocaust so that that child (a 4th grader) had never been born. Many of these kids didn't understand what they were doing. Some did. I live in what is considered a progressive part of Los Angeles and this is happening. Why does your curriculum ignore this? 2. The purpose (per their mission statement) of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement it to denigrate Jews and Israel. They have bullied and intimidated Jews to the point that they have feared for their safety (see recent USC stories). Elevating BDS in this curriculum means you support their hateful and racist tactics. BDS should not be part of the curriculum. I note that even Arab states are not supporting a boycott of Israel and are expanding ties with Israel. Why are you elevating BDS, an outlier organization? 3. Jewish Americans represent a diverse group. The current curriculum treats them like every Jew has the same experience. Provide more material. There is certainly a lot of it.
