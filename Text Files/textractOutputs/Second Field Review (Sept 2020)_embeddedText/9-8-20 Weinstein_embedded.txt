Dear IQCPlease consider the following comments. Thanks ________________________________
Appendix A Beginning Line 179 through 189.
Unit 6: Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American.
Unit 6 is an anti-semitic dog whistle that will create hatred toward Jews. It is a patently racist curriculum developed to demean Jews. It must be deleted in its entirety! It is laughable and hypocritical that other parts of the curriculum discuss recognition of antisemitism and yet there is an entire UNIT dedicated to stoking it!

Appendix B Line 378 African American Studies
The section needs more balance. On 2019, police fatally shot 13 Africian Americans (https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/23/fact-check-how-manyunarmed-black-men-did-police-kill-2019/5322455002/). The section ignores the huge intraracial homicide rate in the USA. For example, in 2018, 2600 African Americans were murdered, 90% of them by other African Americans. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-theu.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/topic-pages/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls
The point is that the people most likely to suffer by demonizing the police are African Americans. It is dishonest to look only at police shootings and not talk about black on black murders and how police presence can help to reduce that number. Again, 13 African Americans were killed by police in 2019. Even if all 13 events were unjustified, it is fewer that 1% of the number of African Americans murdered by other African Americans. But the curriculum is silent on those murders...why?....and silence is violence right?

Chapter 3 Model Curriculum Line 368
All references to critical race theory should be deleted. By teaching students that the system is rigged (which it is not) and that trying to succeed is pointless, the curriculum condemns minority students to a lifetime of an inferiority complex. If Barack Obama or Tim Scott believed this nonsense, they would have not reached the offices to which they were elected because they would have believed their best hope was driving for Uber. There are surely racists in America but today--America is not a racist country and neither are its laws. Critical Race Theory is a vehicle for some people to make a quick buck by teaching it to others and selling books--but it represents a 21st Century form of enslavement of the mind and is 100% un-American. Ironically, on line 732, the document talks about cultivating self worth (good!) which is exactly the opposite of what Critical Race Theory does. CRT teaches black kids they are hopeless in American society. It's really appalling that this was put into the curriculum.
