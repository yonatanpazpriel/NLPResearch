Copenhagen Calling California to Combat BDS
Dear Sir
I am writing to you from Europe (Copenhagen, Denmark) to further encourage you to combat anti-Semitism and BDS. Apparently, the situation within the California public school system is so bad, that European Jews fear the repercussions of American antiSemitism.
Please understand that all Jewish Institutions in Denmark are already under 24 hour Police and Military protection following multiple lethal anti-Semitic terror attacks.
Many Anti-Semitic terrorists become radicalized in Schools and Universities that promote BDS.
Yours Sincerely Dr. Niels Levi, MD Ph.D.
