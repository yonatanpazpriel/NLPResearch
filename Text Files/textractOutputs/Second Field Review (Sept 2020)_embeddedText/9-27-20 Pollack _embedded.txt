To Whom It May Concern -
My name is Aliza Pollack, and I live in Los Angeles. My kids are currently in Middle School in the LAUSD system. I so strongly believe in the power of intersectionality - which requires exploration across people's history. As a Jewish person, it is my honor to learn about AsianAmericans in CA or African American history (and others). It provides me with such a greater understanding and empathy for those groups. Likewise, I think it is paramount that the Ethnic Studies Curriculum have a more nuanced approach to the Jewish American experience and Jewish history. Lack of knowledge leads to seeing others as less than human and their history as less nuanced. We can see from the resurgence of anti-semitism globally and in the US, that these stories, in all their complexity, need to be told and re-told. The more we share our stories, the more we can see our commonalities across groups.
To that end, I have 4 requests to register that can aid in perpetuating a more inclusive representation of Jews. I am looking to this leadership to accept and pledge to the following:
1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel -- including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing to the ESMC
No one is free until we are all free.
Thank you most sincerely,
Aliza Pollack
