Hello,
I'm sending this email to support the inclusion of learning about current and historical antisemitism, including the Holocaust, in the curriculum for schools in California. As hate in this society--including antisemitism is frighteningly on the rise, schools must do everything in their power to make sure students have knowledge based on facts, not the untruths and opinions we see everywhere we turn today. Schools seem to be the only place left where factual material is taught, and young people are taught to think critically and not just believe everything they see.
Due mainly to the widely accepted notion--especially by young people--that what they see on social media is fact, knowledge of antisemitism and the Holocaust is rapidly decaying, and the rate of Holocaust denial is increasing due to this ignorance. It is CRITICAL that schools cover these topics not once, but several times, during a student's school life so that they can see, hear, and understand this important piece of history. Students need to learn that 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis in an effort to eradicate them from the earth. Many Christians and others were also killed during the Holocaust. The bottom line lesson here to students should be that when hate gets out of control, this is what can happen. TO ANYONE.
Thank you, Renata Chase, LCSW, PPSC (retired)
