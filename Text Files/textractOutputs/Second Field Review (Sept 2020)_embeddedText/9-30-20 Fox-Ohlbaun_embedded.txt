From: Sonia Fox-Ohlbaum Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 6:43 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethics curriculum
I am so disturbed by your omittance of anti-Semitism and your choice to put in Arab-American information. Who is driving your change in curriculums? Please reconsider and re-draft the curriculum because I find it extremely offensive to our Jewish Americans.
