From: Holly Ullman Sent: Wednesday, September 23, 2020 12:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Letter from Member of Jewish community
September 22 2020
I am a California voter and a member of the Jewish community. I am a parent and grandparent and an attorney.
I thank those who supported the changes in the first draft that removed denigrating content regarding Jews and Israel and that added a mention of anti-Semitism as form of hate.
However, without changes to the second draft, Jewish students at best will feel excluded and at worst feel harassed and intimidated in a hostile environment.
So, I add my voice to many in requesting the following.
1. Reject the new proposed language of the Guiding Values and Principles. The language of the first draft encouraged understanding and sense of community among diverse groups. The new version advances a political philosophy that creates division and fuels anger.
2. For that matter, do not allow any group to highjack the purpose of the curriculum with a political agenda.
3. I advocate protections for every ethnic group. For Jews, please create stronger guardrails (including insistence on transparency) to ensure that derogatory language about Jews and Israel as well as promotion of the BDS agenda stay out of the classroom.
4. Along with Arab-Americans, include the more than 200,000 Jewish- Americans from Middle East and North Africa in the Asian-America populations. Point out that there are many Jews of color.
5. Expand on the experience of anti-Semitism in the U.S. but also the positive aspects of the Jewish-American experience.
Sincerely,
Holly Ullman Stanford, CA
