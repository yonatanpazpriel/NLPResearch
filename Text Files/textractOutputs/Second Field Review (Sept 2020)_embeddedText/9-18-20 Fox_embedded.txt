From: Joan and Marv Fox Sent: Friday, September 18, 2020 4:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To It May Concern:
I am most disturbed with the recent action addressing the wording of the improved second draft for the Ethnics Studies Model Curriculum for our California students. I call upon the CA Department of Education and the Instructional Quality Commission to accept and pledge to the following four requests related to the ESMC:
1. The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism. 2. No return of the derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to
keep such language out of the classroom in the future. 3. The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish
Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color. 4. Commit to complete transparency to developing the curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration of the above four suggestions.
Your very truly Joan Fox
