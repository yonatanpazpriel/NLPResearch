I am: 1. retired social studies , bilingual , teacher in CA . my years in the classroom were 1977-2013. 2. i co authored the Mexican American history curriculum for Salinas Union High School District in 1992. 3. I was award HERO OF THE COMMUNITY award from the Diversity Center of Santa Cruz county last October. 4. i wrote a short story about coming out in the clasroom: "Conversations with Jesus". it was published in the second edition of 1 TEACHER IN 10 , edited by Kevin Jennings, from Alyson books in 2006.
you now have some of my credentials that make me eligible to speak on this topic. All aspects of our national identity must be included. that includes the GLBT population . the course must also explore all the various forms of hate groups that exist in our nation. if we are to arrest the disturbing trend of the Boogalo boys and proud boys, they need to be exposed as hate groups in the curriculum. i am taking plenty of flack , as a candidate for the Cabrillo college board of trustees here in Santa Cruz county, for suggesting we rename the college. Cabrillo was a genocidal, sexual predator who helped destroy the Ohlone people in the 1540's. He was murdered in the jungle of Guatemala and never returned to Spain. the indignenous people of CA , like the OHLONE, must be included.
thank you for your attention.
