From: Charles Kaseff Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 7:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments on the second ESMC draft
Dear Sir or Madam,
The entire purpose of teaching ethnic studies to high school students is to foster tolerance and understanding of people of different cultures and religions. Therefore, it is imperative that the class in this subject be void of any bigotry or racism.
I have learned that there is anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias in a lesson about Arab Americans. An ethnic studies class that perpetuates anti-Semitism is the ultimate in hypocrisy and bigotry. Not only must this text be removed, but a lesson on anti-Semitism must be added.
You have the opportunity to fix this situation before anything is published, which will save the taxpayers of this state much money and embarrassment.
Thank you for your consideration.
Charles Kaseff
