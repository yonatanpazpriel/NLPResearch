After looking at your choice of curriculum it appears that you will teach mostly of suffering and oppression. Your teaching should focus on a purpose that makes people feel proud to be an American. The role of educational institutions is to improve the chances of better and limit the chance of worse - knowing we will have some of both. The better is seeking truth, welcoming inquiry, treasuring the arts of civilization, celebrating liberty, upholding the rule of law, shaping personal character, and aspiring to civic virtue. The worse is to limit the destruction of our culture in the name of social justice. Your area of study borders on indoctrination with the purpose of transforming the United States of America, land of the free into a plantation of slaves who have no right to pursue freedom of religion, no free speech, no free enterprise and to depend only on the government, their master for their welfare and safety. The indoctrination of the young mind is deeply ingrained in Marxist ideology. New research has emerged to show how brain development leads to emotional reactivity and poor decision � making that characterizes teenagers. Anti � Racist is a claim that America is a "system" of racial oppression. The evil of racism is deemed so deep that no living white person can be absolved and no "person of color" has been spared. Are some groups more equal than others? Only the individual has rights guaranteed protection by the courts.

When government assigns race to an individual and violates his or her rights the government acts unconstitutionally. The testimony of urban chaos is still raw. The common explanation is an eruption of the black underclass against "systemic racism" in the US. But the driving force behind the chaos is hatred of America. The supposed insurrection of the racially oppressed has a false bottom. Beneath it lies the passionate belief that America is rotten through � and through, a belief nourished by many of our colleges, universities and K12 educational systems. This pile � up wreckage of discontents, fail to give a clear picture of what happened. Among the debris are shards of multiculturalism, post-modernism, cultural Marxism, gender theory, deconstruction, reparations, socialjustice, sustainability and Culture Race Theory which is a NeoMarxist thought that leads to violence and is very dangerous. These institutions of higher learning are facing a financial catastrophe of unprecedented magnitude. The catastrophe is in their budgets which makes serious reform possible. Our children are taught in school to hate America. We live in a world where bad men did good things and good men did bad things. The current educational system is either intentionally or unintentionally paving the way to present a universal education so that mankind will learn to think on one level. In the end freedom of expression and freedom of faith will be limited to the dictates of the image of freedom, based on the definition of a global conscience. The New York Times "1619 Project" and associated curriculum disseminated by the Pulitzer Center teaches a polemical narrative of oppression, shorn of nuance, context, on historical

accuracy. It promotes biased distortion of our nations' history and of our constitution. Yet it has had success in persuading minds across the Nation and beyond that the "America the exceptional nation" story is wrong, misguided and fails to tell the whole truth. The "1619 Project" has been debunked as factual misrepresentation and should not and cannot be used as textbook material. Our public education tax dollars are not to be used to promote socialism. In socialism the state becomes god. In a "nanny state" you get the people more and more dependent upon government for their very living. Socialism involves government coercion and theft from citizen A's property on behalf of citizen b. The socialist government makes more money than either citizen A or citizen B in the administration of this theft by taxation and coercion. As the far-left agenda drives a wedge between Americans, we need to remember how much unites us. Our textbooks should help celebrate the value contributions of people of color throughout our nation. From education to business, government, science, military service and every possible sector. One approach is to teach our children to focus on uniqueness and individual characteristics of each person rather than whether this person is male or female, old or young, black, or white. We to think about who a person is as opposed to quickly defining him or her based on race, gender and age, which are the big social boxes that people lock one another into. We need to learn to put ourselves in the other persons shoes. We need to change the narrative, words like "leveling the playing field" to "increasing opportunity for all." Recognize the

value of affirmation � understanding family values and strengths is a powerful inoculation against negative messages. The research is definitive. If you mention Black or Latino stereotypes before a test, they will do more poorly. If you use a negative stereotype in an area where a group is vulnerable, the performance of that group will be affected. We must reject stereotyping. Consciously choosing to act in opposition to the stereotypes you can make a profound difference in how you treat others. For example, there has been a dramatic designation of LGBT individuals and that has not happened by chance. Discrimination reflects the cultural feeds that people are getting, so we need to alter those feeds at the source. Seek policy solutions that protect while compensating the people who are losing equal opportunity. Seek a solution that should be working in harmony to find solutions, rather than pitting communities against one another. If accepting Christ is not enough � then it is a people's problem. (C.S. Lewis). The lesson is it does not matter what you look like, we are all image bearers of God. You can be tall or short, fat or thin, ugly or handsome or you can be black, brown or white. It does not matter. We are all made in the image of God our creator. What matters is the size of your heart and the strength of your character. God tells what Earth is for. Your life matters and you have a role proclaiming the message of the path to life that people will be drawn to it. Do not dilute the message that the problem between God and man is that our appetite for God is too weak � that we cannot fathom how amazing God can be in our lives.

The following narrative is quoting Allan W. Dowd from an article he wrote for the October 2020 issue of the American Legion magazine titled "Separated we Survive". I quote. Respect for religion is patriotic and something we can agree on, even in time of philosophical division. Eighty-seven percent of Americans believe in God. That is astonishing for a country as diverse as ours. Importantly, it is not a single faith that unites us, but respect for faith. A belief in American exceptionalism is patriotic. Eighty-five percent of Americans believe America "stands above all other countries" or is "one of the greatest counties" according to Pew. Yet many young Americans do not grasp how unique America is, how much America has done for the world, how fortunate we are to live here. The stuff we take for granted � political freedom, economic opportunity, the rule of law, the right to peacefully assemble, freedom of movement and speech, the right to believe in any god or no god at all- is rare. Only 43 percent of countries are considered free; only 4 percent of humanity lives in America. Countless millions journey here from other lands to taste freedom � to take part of a nation, where refugees from Vietnam and Cuba can succeed and prosper in a short period of time. Where a refugee from Czechoslovakia could be entrusted to oversee foreign policy, a Taiwanese immigrant could serve in the President's cabinet, a child born in Soviet scarcity could grow up to build a doorway , to the internet's limitless possibilities (Google), the son of a Turkish diplomat(Coca-Cola), or a Syrian refugee (Apple), or a Cuban immigrant (Amazon) could launch the world's most ubiquitous companies, a child

could escape Nazis and the Red Army and grow to Command the Armed Forces of his adopted home. Only in America. It is a wonder why the people of Hong Kong are waving US flags and singing "The Star-Spangled Banner" as they rally against Beijing. Too many Americans are unaware of America's story. This is where American Legion posts, chambers of commerce, laborunion locals, (NAS)National Association of Scholars, Hillsdale College, Heritage.org, and other sources. Partnering with educators, we can share America's story, explain why we sometimes must sacrifice for the public good and sometimes must fight for individual liberty, and remind young Americans � and each other � that what unites us is bigger than what separates us. I humbly submit these comments for your consideration. I am a Vietnam Veteran, Former School Board Trustee, Retired Business Owner, Migrant Worker, first generation son of Mexican immigrants. Married to the same woman for 40 years, have 4 children, 3 sons and one daughter. One son is a Veteran, served one tour in Iraq and one tour in Afghanistan. My daughter served in the Army JAG corps and is now an Attorney for Homeland Security at the southern border. One son works for a military contractor in Boston. Two of my sons are now Baptist Pastors, one of which is the veteran. My parents migrated from Mexico in 1920. My father had no education but was a skilled farm hand. He became the first Mexican immigrant to become a land- owner in the most racist county in Texas. I grew up in a segregated school system and yet succeeded in making a good life for my family. My parents

made getting an education, learning English a priority and the key for success. Immigrants need to learn to become Americans so that they can overcome all obstacles and live the American Dream. Teach them to love America with all its faults and help make it better.
