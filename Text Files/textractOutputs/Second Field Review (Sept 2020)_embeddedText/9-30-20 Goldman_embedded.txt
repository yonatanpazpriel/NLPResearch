From: Alice Goldman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 3:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed Curriculum
To the Honorable Toby Thurmond:
I completely support the position of Agudath Israel of California objecting to the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum.
Of personal concern to me is the Unit which teaches that Jewish American enjoy special privilege by passing as "white." What does "passing as white" mean? Are all Jews actually non-white and therefore either of African descent? Asian? American Indian? And exactly what special privileges do Jews enjoy as opposed to Mormons? Seventh Day Adventists? I have experienced anti-Semitism on more than one occasion. Based on my skin color, I don't have to "pass" as "white." In answer any question I have been asked about my ethnicity, I would qualify as "Anglo", i.e.. "white."
What seems to have been conveniently overlooked is that there are Ethiopian Jews who are clearly black. There are middle eastern Jews (Iranian, Moroccan, Iraqi etc), who, by your standards, would "pass" as Asian.
It seems as though the curriculum, instead of promoting tolerance of and respect for all peoples regardless of race, color or religion, is promoting anti-Semitism. And there is more than enough of that right now.
I urge you to honor the California Department of Education and State Superintendent's commitment to
"removing all language or content that can be perceived as anti-Semitic" from the proposed curriculum.
Thank you for inviting considering comment from the public, including mine.
Sincerely, Alice Goldman
