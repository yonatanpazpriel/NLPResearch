From: Eric Udoff Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies guidelines
Gentlemen: I am concerned about the inclusion of anti Semitic tropes and the exclusion of a widely accepted definition of antisemitism in the ethnic studies guidelines.Anti Semitic incidents have increased in California in the past several years and this needs to be addressed.
Sincerely, Eric J. Udoff, M.D. San Diego, CA
