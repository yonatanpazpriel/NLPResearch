Dear Madam/Sir,
Sikhs are 5th largest group of people in the world, Their culture,Heritage, ethnicity and way of life (Appearance) is not only unique but stands out as example to address the 21st century problems of racism and intolerance towards minorities, Sikhs were/and on the fore front of fighting COVID 19 issues while feeding health heroes across America and as doctors/physicians are fighting this epidemic alongside American brothers and sisters While maintaining their articles of faith, Where South Asia is known for many different faiths and appearances but none else feels the back lashes on their appearances, making it very absolutely important to discuss Sikh as distinct entity and should be ignored.
My children were raised and went to public schools and public Universities in California, I have a very good understanding of the system and what is good and what is not so good.
3 to 4 years ago, I walked at lunchtime in my clinic neighbourhood, first time in my life, young youth stop their SUV and called him me terrorist to get out of the country, have been living in USA for 38 years, I never thought something like this could happen until I faced it, I never put a complaint about this incident, but it changed my life, as I like to walk in the neighbourhood that my work or at my home, since then I have never worked alone and never at late in the evening. I am very vigilant and uncomfortable, I am very well travelled across USA with my children and enjoyed it without having an incident but since then I only go to crowded places.
I think you all are very well aware of Sikh Identity challenges but not paying attention, you should do this Sikh education voluntarily otherwise you may be part of the ignorant people who do not know who Sikhs are, or you could be a small fraction of the people who actually know but don't think it is a big deal to teach the rest of the public.
I request you do something, something means you educate growing children about Sikhs and their different but acceptable appearance. Your Efforts to include Sikh history will make a difference in the future.
Thanks N S Dhaliwal MD Carmichael, CA
