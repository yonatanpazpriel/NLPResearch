While I understand and support Ethnic Studies if executed more like a history class, I am concerned that there will be anti-capitalism and anti-Semitic ideology injected into the curriculum. It is essential that courses get closer to the source and use historical evidence as opposed to political opinions derived by authors and teachers that reflect ideologies of specific movements or groups. It is imperative that this curriculum is not used as a weapon for political purposes or to alienate and discriminate against specific groups like Jews. Capitalism and democracy are an essential aspect of the United States of America and has allowed for businesses to flourish (creating jobs), freedom of press, education, justice and the majority of people (including a country founded on and enhanced by immigrants) to prosper in varying degrees. While it is imperfect, made terrible mistakes and some cases committed crimes, it is the best form of government and economics in the world that has led to a society that has slowly evolved and grown through a series of incremental improvements over time. This cannot be ignored and to provide students with a sense that this system is completely broken and that better governments and economic ways exist is flawed based on historical evidence. The curriculum must truly focus on more awareness for the ethnic groups mentioned and creating a more inclusive society that works within democracy, capitalism and freedom of religion as a framework.
I saw this opinion piece in the WSJ and thus, why I am sending a note.
