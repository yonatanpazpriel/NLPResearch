From: Morey Schapira Sent: Thursday, September 24, 2020 1:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] The ESMC
I have reviewed the proposed new ESMC and find it flawed and lacking. I wish that you had based it on the remarkable teachings of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but unfortunately for the young men and women in California, you didn't.
Here are my specific concerns:
1. The ESMC's "Guiding Values and Principles" must be revised to remove language which can and will be used to justify bringing anti-Israel and antisemitic hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331. 2. Safeguards must be added against the ESMC and ethnic studies courses in general being used to promote one-sided political agendas, including antisemitic, anti-Israel and/or anti-Zionist agendas. 3. The curriculum must be revised to accurately represent the diversity of the Jewish community and teach about antisemitism in all its forms across the political spectrum. This should include how antisemitism has manifested within the field of ethnic studies itself. 4. The curriculum must be revised to add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities, including Jews, Iranians, Arabs, and others, instead of the current discriminatory approach that favors one group over all others.
Sincerely,
Morey Schapira
