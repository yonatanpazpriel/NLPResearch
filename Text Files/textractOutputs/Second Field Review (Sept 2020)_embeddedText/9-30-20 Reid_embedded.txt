To whom it may concern:
The proposed curriculum for ethnic studies in California is an affront to a multicultural and inclusive society, as it paints a cartoonish portrait of geo-political, racial, ethnic, and societal values of the Jewish people like something out of 1930s Germany. The material as it has been defined is without question, anti-semetic. This is not surprising as most of you probably don't know what the Hollcuast was. Here is a reminder:

How easy it is to forget the suffering of that past, when we feel others are suffering now.

I support the ADL's class for a more inclusive curriculum including: 1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent. 2. An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010. 3. Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. 4. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
In closing, you should be ashamed of yourselves. Ashamed for the ignorance you are showing. Ashamed for the cute games you are playing with what Californias will be taught about complex issues. We as Californians deserve better than the choices you have made. You are simply laying the milestones away from 'Never Again'.
Sincerely,
Dylan Reid
