From: Tai Puamau Sent: Thursday, October 1, 2020 12:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] PI Studies Curriculum support
Dear Instructional Quality Commission:
With regard to the above-referenced subject, I write as a public commentator in support of Pacific Islander studies in California.
After review of the latest revised 8/13/20 draft, I find that Pacific Islander studies, although lightly referenced in outline under Appendix A, is not actually integrated and offered in greater detail throughout the outline or significantly elsewhere throughout the draft. As a Pacific Islander, these studies on our Pacific Islander cultures and narratives are just as important and worth critical study as much as other key areas of ethnic studies are.
I hope that with these considerations, we may work towards building a future curriculum that will include Pacific Islander studies as well as other key cultures and narratives not already integrated in the current draft.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, Tai Puamau
