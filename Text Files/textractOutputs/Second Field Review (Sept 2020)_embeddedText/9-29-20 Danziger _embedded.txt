From: Elizabeth Danziger Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 1:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
This curriculum propagates anti-Semitic and anti-Israel views that are antithetical to the concept of respecting all minorities. PLEASE, do not pass this biased and hateful curriculum that will indoctrinate schoolchildren not in tolerance, but in hate. Thank you, Elizabeth Danziger Concerned mother and grandmother
