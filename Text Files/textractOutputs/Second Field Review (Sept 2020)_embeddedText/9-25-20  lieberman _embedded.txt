Hi Regarding your recent proposed changes to the ethnic curriculum, I feel compelled to write you and explain why I feel alarmed. Every minority in Anmerica has the right to feel protected and safe. At present, as a Jewish person in America I do not. Society can easily fall back into the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust if tolerance of every race and ethnic group isn't explicitly taught. Anti-Semitism must be addressed. It must be addressed and combatted in all of its forms and by not including the Jewish people in the discussion of minorities, and by incorporating a poem that perpetuates false,negative attitudes about Jewish people (ie they own the money, the media etc) and undermines the right of the state of Israel to exist, you are promoting an attitude of fear and intolerance in a generation that had never needed to tolerate and accept more. Thanks so much for your time!
