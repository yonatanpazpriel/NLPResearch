From: Bella Yadegar Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 10:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC REVISIONS
Dear IQC and SBE Members,
I am writing to you to express deep concern with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I urge you to please revise this curriculum to accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about anti semitism in all forms. It is crucial that the next generation receives a fair, unbiased education and it is essential that we prevent hate starting with high school students. Please remove "Guiding Values and Principles" from the ESMC because this can be used to justify hate and bias, violating AB331. By adding a unit about Middle Eastern communities (the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA), this could be a great step to give more diversity.
As a first generation American, my parents and grandparents had to flee their country because we are Jewish. They experienced hate and persecution that should never happen again. My aunt's high school teacher preached to the class that killing a Jew is a victory. Imagine how it would feel to sit in a class as a 15 year old watching your friends reactions to saying you should be murdered. This is something no child should experience again. The classroom should be a place where we all feel welcome and included. By adding more diversity and inclusion to represent the Jewish community in this curriculum, you will be on the right side of history.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you will take this into consideration.
