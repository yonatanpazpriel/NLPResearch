I am writing about the proposed 2020 California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I am aware that the 2019 proposed curriculum was revised, and I acknowledge the significant improvements made and thank the Board members for making those changes. However, I still have concerns about the currently proposed curriculum and the very recently proposed additions/amendments.
First, the proposed curriculum gives short shift to anti-Semitism as an example of bias and doesn't mention the significant number and continued rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes in America. Instead, it provides a distorted view of Jews as being part of the white racially privileged cohort. It also completely ignores the differing experiences within the Jewish community e.g. Middle Eastern Jews who make up over 50% of California's Middle Easterner population.
The proposed curriculum originally focused on the four traditional groups of ethnic studies. However, the proposed inclusion of additional groups....made less than 24 hours before the scheduled August 12, 2020, meeting opens the door to inclusion of ALL significant ethnic groups in California. If groups beyond the traditional four are to be included, then the experience of Jewish Americans should also be included. Why would one group be left out....why include Arab Americans and Pacific Islanders but not Jewish Americans?
The exclusion of Jewish Americans would be a gapping omission and could be interpreted as racial bias in and of itself......thereby undermining the premise for the whole ethnic studies program.
Furthermore, the attempt to broaden the scope of the ethnic studies curriculum beyond the traditional 4 groups, but still without the inclusion of Jewish Americans, could be interpreted as covert backtracking from the commitment reflected in the revisions made to the 2019 curriculum and create a lack of trust in the process.
I would like to recommend the following:
� A section be added to the sample lessons & topics that includes a broad review of the Jewish American experience, including background about the Holocaust and the loss of 6,000,000 million Jewish lives in what could be considered the largest hate crime of our lifetime, and the existence of anti-Semitism in America;
� The lesson on REDLINING should make clear that the practice was not limited to or solely focused on African Americans and that Jews were often the target of redlining...religious covenants existed alongside racial ones;
� Re-commit to not including denigrating comments about Israel, reference to the BDS movement or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (which is not an appropriate subject for "ethnic studies"); and

� Ensure that the rules for creating the curriculum are adhered to, including that any changes be made available for public review and comment for at least 30 days and reaffirm a commitment to transparency of the process.
