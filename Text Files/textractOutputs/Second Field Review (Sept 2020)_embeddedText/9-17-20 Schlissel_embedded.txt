Hello,
I am writing in from Minnesota to ask why the school curriculum of the State of California is going to include an Ethnic studies curriculum that only includes Jews in terms of white privilege?
I am truly curious to this, in light of growing anti-Semitism thanks to decisions like this, like the Alameda school district allowing bullying of Jews. If you need links to these issues, I will be glad to send them.
I have faced anti-Semitism all my life, and believe you me, it's not for my looking for it. From being called a "dirty Jew" while being physically beaten by other children growing up, to people asking me if I was Jewish because I "look Jewish," (so much for blending in as a white person, huh?), to subtly being asked in my current state of residence if I was, "from out east," to having LA celebrity Mel Gibson tell the police that, "Jews start all the wars in the world." None of those are white privilege. When Jewish businesses and places of worship are attacked in the George Floyd riots, to having a Chabad shot up in Poway (let alone Pittsburgh), Jews are singled out. In fact, at 2% of the population, we are the victims of 60% of the hate crimes in the country. WHAT A PRIVILEGE IT HAS BEEN!
It seems demeaning that your idea of intersectionality does not include my intersection.
I sincerely hope, that as the leaders of so much public policy in this country, that you will actually take the lead and see the things we have contributed, and see the steep incline that we face and realize that white privilege is not actually something we have when the chips are down. We are singled out a lot, much as we are in this legislation that you are trying to push through now.
Please consider this as you decide.
Sincerely, Dan Schlissel
