Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020.
As a retired elementary school teacher in the San Francisco Unified School District I feel it is extremely important to include Asian American history as part of the ESMC. It is extremely important to the development of our California students to have the full complement of the ethnicities of our students. To be a real part of California, our students need to see their histories as part of the mosaic of California history.
I particularly support the inclusion of Japanese American history as I have seen the positive effect of these studies for students and families of Japanese ethnicity and students of many other ethnicities through my years of teaching experience.
Asian American history is an irrevocable part of California and U.S. history.
Sincerely,
Bruce Waters Retired Teacher, Japanese Bilingual Bicultural Program (Rosa Parks School) San Francisco Unified School District
