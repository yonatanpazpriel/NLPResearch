From: Chris Hioki Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: APISBMA. Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Japanese American history in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Chris Hioki. I am a 3rd generation Japanese American living in Milpitas, CA.
It has come to my understanding that the CDE Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does not include Asian American Pacific Islanders, including the history of the Japanese Americans.
The Japanese Americans (JA) have been an essential part of California's history, most notably the incarceration and loss of civil liberties of 120,000 JA during WWII. During this dark period of my Country's past, the Japanese Americans struggled, yet persevered and contributed to our Country, not only during that time, but afterwards and to this day.
Without this information, we as a nation will continue to allow the loss of civil liberties of groups due to race and/or religion.
My hope is for the inclusion by the CDE Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum of the rich history of Japanese Americans as well as the diverse communities of the Asian American Pacific Islanders.
Sincerely,
Chris Hioki
