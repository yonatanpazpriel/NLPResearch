From: Wendy Greene Sent: Wednesday, September 9, 2020 5:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pacific High School concerned parent
To Whom it may concern,
My name is Wendy Sundquist, my middle son attends Pacific High School in San Bernardino. He is currently a junior there. Since distance learning began I have closely monitored his assignments mostly to make sure he understands them, completes them, and turns them in on time. His English 3 class started an assignment based on the book written by Harlon Dalton entitled "Racial Healing " a chapter in his book is entitled "white skin privilege" this has been a hot topic for 2 weeks now with myself and the staff of my son's school. I have literally been in an email war with them regarding how unacceptable and offensive this discussion is, especially during this time; with the terrorist BLM movement going on. The principal and I discussed my concerns at length and she encouraged me to voice my opinion as a parent on this platform. As a parent it is my opinion that sensitive topics like this should not be held in a classroom, this is a topic that should be held at home. To have racially sensitive topics with intent to ease racial tension, only stokes racial tension. To have racial slurs as titles to the chapters of a book in a high school classroom is unacceptable to me as a parent. Religion, sexuality, and racial identity has no business in a classroom. Those discussions should stay in the home. Period.
Respectfully, Wendy Sundquist [ADDRESS REDACTED] San Bernardino, CA
