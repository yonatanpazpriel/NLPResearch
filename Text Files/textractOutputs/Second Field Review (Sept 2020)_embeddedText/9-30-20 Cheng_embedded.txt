Dear Tony Thurmond,
It has come to my attention that the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, in regards to the Asian American section, leaves out the Vietnamese American, Korean American, and South Asian American groups as well as many others. It also fails to adequately cover the contributions of Japanese Americans and their incarceration. We are also aware that the first draft of the curriculum had a Pan-Asian studies which covered issues such as the Model Minority Myth. This is critical to our Asian American history, and to leave this section out would be a disservice to the children who don't understand what it means to be Asian American, despite being bullied and attacked by others for being Asian American.
Please reconsider the Asian American curriculum in your Ethnic Studies proposal to be more inclusive of many other groups.
Thank you, Alice
