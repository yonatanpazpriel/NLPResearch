Dear CDE, I am a Jewish American, the daughter of immigrants who arrived in the United States 100 years ago from Eastern Europe. They faced discrimination in housing, in education, in hotels, in government..... I have followed with deep concern the propose curriculum which is political and needlessly and I believe irresponsibly elevates one group's experiences with discrimination over that of other groups. Prejudice and bigotry are wrong. Period. I ask that you act on your responsibility to give a balanced curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps. I understand that some revisions have been made to the proposed new curriculum, but I remain deeply worried about the lack of transparency that has surrounded the addition of an Arab-American sample lesson and the BDS movement. BDS advocates for a foreign conflict that falls outside the scope of high school ethnic studies courses in the U.S. Its unequivocal goal is to see the destruction of the State of Israel. That does not belong in American classrooms. Promoting hate does not belong in our classrooms. Please reconsider the chapter on Jewish Americans and thank you for listening to the Jewish community's grave concerns concerning the overly political curriculum. Judith R. Forman
