From: Omar Hassaine Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 11:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Studies as Part of Ethnic Studies!
Dear Tony Thurmond, Linda Darling-Hammond, and Ethnic Studies officials:
The National Association of Asian American studies issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC. Core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in1969 include American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. A decades-long momentum in higher education includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies. Omitting and not specifically naming Arab Studies signals that Arab Americans do not deserve to be seen or heard. Best Regards
Omar Hassaine
