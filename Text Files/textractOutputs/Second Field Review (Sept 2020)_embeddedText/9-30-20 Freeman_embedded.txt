From: Tom Freeman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am a California resident who is very concerned about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, based on what I have read about it. I know that at one time it was objectionable, based on a pretty overt anti-Israel bias. While some of these materials were removed after objections from the public, I am concerned because it is my understanding that the entire curriculum has not been made available for public review and comment. This lack of transparency is concerning to me, especially given the defects in the materials previously made available.
Please make the entire curriculum available.
