Please be advised that I am completely against this bill ESMC or AB 331. It is incomprehensible to me that your would require something for graduating before you know what it is.
Can you remember " We have to pass this bill to see what is in it"?
I have the distinct feeling nobody wants the public to know what is in it before it is passed.
