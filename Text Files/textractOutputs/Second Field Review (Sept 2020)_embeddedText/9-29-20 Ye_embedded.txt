Hello there,
I have a high schooler and I am very concerned about the current Aug. 2020 draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)., which absolutely make no sense! DO NOT misguide students with fabricated facts and left wing ideology! If you need to put history of suppression, those are what happened: exploiting chinese labor for railway, the chinese exclusion act, japanese concentration camp.
I'd like to add my support for the following two requests for revisions: + Request Genuine Ethnic Studies Curriculum that Comply with California History-Social Studies
Framework 2016, sent to you by Better Ethnic Studies: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hMvPYBFWGIKG8iGf1dMHhkYNKpgir9p/view?usp=sharing (PDF) + the detailed revision requests recently sent to you by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyXME2uQNrJSjTeSLeYnN_oChl7rYfdO/view (DOCX)
