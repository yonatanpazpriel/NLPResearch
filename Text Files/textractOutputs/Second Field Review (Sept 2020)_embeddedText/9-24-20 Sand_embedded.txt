Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond, State Superintendent Tony Thurmond, and Governor Gavin Newsom,
As a retired teacher, I write to you with deep concern about the current draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I urge you to remove the political agenda from the "Guiding Values and Principles" and resulting lessons by removing the inflammatory "Guiding Values," which promote radical ideological aims such as "transformative post-imperial resistance," and can be used to justify bringing hate and political dogma into the classroom.
Additionally, the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement and other one-sided political conversations about Middle Eastern conflicts do not belong in California Ethnic Studies and create unsafe classrooms for students.
The following best sums up my thoughts:
Vera Hartford, a lawyer and political refugee from communist Czechoslovakia, writes, "For those of us that grew up in Soviet bloc countries, the ESMC is like d�j� vu. We are dumbfounded by a curriculum that consistently elevates Socialism, Marxism, and Communism as the way students are encouraged to become socially responsible. We are familiar with an educational system that proselytizes this specific political dogma that is proven to be unworkable and discriminatory in itself. It grooms and conditions impressionable minds to an ideology in service of a political agenda. Intolerance, bullying, and loss of freedom inevitably follow."
Thank you for your attention to these crucial problems with the ESMC.
Sincerely,
Larry Sand
