I taught high school United States History, European History, and Asian Studies for thirty-five years. I believe that as many ethnic groups who wish to be part of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum should be included. Since there are many different ethnicities in California, a solution could be to have information and lessons on a website for California teachers. Each educator could then teach the experience of the racial and ethnic groups that are in their school district. This could be very effective in improving racial relations and cross-cultural understanding.
My teaching materials on teaching United States History thematically could be helpful in developing Ethnic Studies Curriculum. My materials are on the Nystrom publishers website:www.nystromeducation.com/connorintro.html. These materials contributed to receiving awards from the Peace Corps Association and the Organization for American Historians. I hope to submit some lessons before September 30th.
Sincerely, -Mary Connor, Author, Educator, and Co-founder National Korean Studies [phone numbers redacted]
