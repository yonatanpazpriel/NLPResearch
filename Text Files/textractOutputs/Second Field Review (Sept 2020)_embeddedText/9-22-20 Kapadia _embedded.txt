Hello,
I have been a resident of California for 40 years and have raised two sons here. I am very pleased that there is going to be an Ethnic Studies curriculum, but want to say that I am very disappointed that Asian and Arab Studies have been removed from the latest draft.
I do feel Ethnic Studies should include both Asian Studies and Arab Studies so that every child understands the value these cultures bring to this country, and some of the atrocities that have been committed (such as the Japanese internment camps) so that history does not repeat itself. I do hope you reconsider this decision.
Thanks, Anita (pronounced Anaita)
