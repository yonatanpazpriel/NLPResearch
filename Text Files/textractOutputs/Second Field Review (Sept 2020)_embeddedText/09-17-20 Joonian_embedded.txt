The Jewish People and State of Israel heritage is a valuable lesson to learn and to explain in this email, but I urge you to not single out one 1 religion to punish for their problems. That will be considered a bigoted ideology, and one might argue a racist one.
We must highlight the positive attributes of all religions and heritages in our curriculum.
Best wishes and be Safe!
