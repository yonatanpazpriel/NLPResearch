I am writing to strongly encourage the inclusion of Japanese American ethnic studies in the California ethnic studies curriculum. The whole relocation of a cultural group must never be allowed to happen again. Only by telling this story of sending all Japanese families to "camps" to our children will history be remembered, so it wont be repeated again. I remember how I was impacted when as a child my third grade teacher told how she had been a teacher in one of the schools. It was wrong to pull these Japanese families out of their homes for over 3 -4 years! This story can be learned from and not lost or repeated.
