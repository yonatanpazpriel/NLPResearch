o I am a physician living in San Francisco I write now to protest what is currently proposed for the curriculum. Specifically there are new bias citations from sources promoting BDS by anti-Israeli authors. The " American Jews " chapter teaches that Jews have become a privileged ethnicity. A terrible trope to promote in these days of rising anti-Semitism. Jews are compared to white supremacists and blamed for racial injustice. How ironically unfair to the many Jews who aided, some with their lives, the civil rights movement. This curriculum was supposed to educate about minorities and their struggles, as proposed now it would be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus increase the targeted hatred we already experience . I urge you to remove all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment, rewrite the chapter on Jewish
Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS. Thank you.
