To Whom It May Concern,
I am deeply concerned that the CDE has added a chapter to the curriculum that is not open for review. A lesson relating to Arab-Americans is welcome, but not one that is guided by antisemitism (BDS) and shrouded in secrecy. If there is a true commitment to fighting discrimination, then I respectfully ask you to open the content for review prior to closing the comment period on September 30.
There is so much promise in working on these issues. Please do not allow this type of discrimination and politicization to take hold and thwart the very noble efforts moved forward by the CDE. Please stand by your pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum.
With thanks, Marcia Borensztajn
