AB 331 invites hateful antisemitic rhetoric, which should NEVER be allowed. There is no reason why the Jews need to be attacked. Togetherness and love is key and attacking or belittling any group is never okay. It is unfathomable that such curriculum would not only be allowed but endorsed by the government in the United States. Many American citizens would be appalled by being forced to have their children learn to hate a particular race. It is UNACCEPTABLE!
