From: Miriam Berman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL]
To the Honorable Tony Thurmond,
The proposed coursework for ethnic studies is extremely concerning. I am shocked that the state would consider teaching ideas that are so biased and untrue.
Please,please I beg that you reject the proposed coursework, and start again with a steering committee that includes a broad cross section of representatives of the population of this great state. I highly encourage you to include local organizations such as the Simon Wiesenthal Center and Agudath Israel of California in further drafts of the proposed curriculum.
This decision has impact for generations to come. Please reconsider. Sincerely, Miriam Berman
