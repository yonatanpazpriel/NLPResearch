Name: Murray Toas Email: [redacted] Organization:Individual Citizen Job Title: Retired Subject: School Curriculum Comment: I am writing to you to express my alarm at the current draft California Ethnic Studies Curriculum I fear that the harmonious relationship of our state's diverse population may be destroyed by the Ethnic Studies Curriculum that suggests that Irish and Jewish Americans need special attention and disdain from California's children. A Monday, August 31 Wall Street Journal editorial described California Assembly Bill AB331 that may put into practice a new educational curriculum that may endorse or promote anti Irish and Antisemitic sentiments. According to the Wall Street Journal: One course outline includes "Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history," it says "that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege." Oh my gosh, how abhorrent and dangerous! Both the Irish and the Jews came to our great country to save their lives. Eighty years ago, the Jews of Europe were singled out by government for condemnation and sent to death. Why would the State of California choose to cultivate animosity towards Irish and Jewish Americans in California's children? Our children be taught to respect all individuals no matter their ethnicity. Our children must learn that we are all Americans no matter what our background. Please ensure that no ethnic, religious, or racial group is targeted for enmity by the state's educational curriculum. Please revise the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum to remove any hints of prejudice.
