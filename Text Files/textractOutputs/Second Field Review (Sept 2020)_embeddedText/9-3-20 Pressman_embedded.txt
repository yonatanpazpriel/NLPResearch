From: Nati Pressman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 5:07 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ethnic studies curriculum
Hi,
My name is Natalie Pressman, and I am a high school student. I am asking you to create a more inclusive Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This means: - teach about all forms of antisemitism - represent the full diversity of the Jewish community - add a comprehensive lesson plan about Middle Eastern communities, including Jews.
I also want to share with you a letter from high school students and allies that over 350 students have signed. Please find it here: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__tinyurl.com_esmcrevisionsletter&d=DwIFAg&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlA-AKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=76zcmo1jXsUta9PUhG7CbuDG-cIkS0m4h_4hZzY3U78&s=IBnuftNoh4woa8_vj9xGztorQNXpNjEXqUbNnC13SE&e=
