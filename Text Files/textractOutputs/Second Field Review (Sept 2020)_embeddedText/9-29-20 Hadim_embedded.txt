Hi. This is Mitra Hadim I was born and raised in Iran. The discrimination we had in Iran between Muslim and Jews was on bearable As a child I have so many bad memories with my friends who were Muslim just because they were learning wrong things about Jewish people at school and Society. The discrimination was so bad that we couldn't live there anymore and we had to escape. Please consider not making Jews get scared and uncomfortable again. USA is a country we all trust and shouldn't be involved with any discrimination.
Thank you
