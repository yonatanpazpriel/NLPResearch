I urge you to revise the ESMC to:
1. Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and teach about antisemitism in all its forms. 2. Add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern communities featuring the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA. 3. Remove "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms, in violation of AB331.
In order to make these changes, I urge you to follow the specific recommendations made here:
