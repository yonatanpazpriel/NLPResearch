From: Ken Goodman Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 10:19 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
Greetings, My name is Kenneth Goodman, I live in Los Angeles.
I am writing to urge you to strike out ALL anti-Semitic and anti-Israel and pro-BDS references in the California public education curriculum. None of these have any place in our public education system; they are part of a larger war of hatred against the Jewish people.
"Diversity" education and "multi-culturalism" should never be used as a veneer for pitting one minority group against another. It's offensive and our taxpayer money should not be used to plant this sort of hatred in our children.
Respectfully,
Kenneth Goodman
