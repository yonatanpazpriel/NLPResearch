I am sure I must have misunderstood that our governor and the Board of Education is planning to implement Ethnic Studies where people of the Jewish faith and people of Irish descendants are going to be accused of racial privilege. They are to be singled out?? Please explain how supporting anti-semitism with the help of Farrakhan and his hate mongrels, the children of color will be more successful in life. Seems you are encouraging racism and teaching children to choose other groups of humans to hate. If I have misunderstood, I apologize and I would appreciate anyone from the California Department of Education to "educate" me on this subject.
