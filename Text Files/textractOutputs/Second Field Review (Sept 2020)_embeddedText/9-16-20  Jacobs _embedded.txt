From: William Jacobs Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 5:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment concerning proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Dear Sir / Madam,
I am writing to you with regard to the proposed California ethnic studies curriculum. After having read the proposed curriculum, I have several concerns.
1. I do not believe that the proposed curriculum adequately reflects the experiences of certain ethnic / religious groups such as Irish Americans, Italian Americans, and Jewish Americans.
2. I am concerned about the potential of the proposed curriculum to become the basis of anti-Semetic and anti-Israel propaganda. Sadly the ideological reputations of many of the development committee participants is out of the mainstream. However well intentioned, the proposed curriculum strikes me as being politically biased.
3. I am troubled by the lack of transparency with which the proposed curriculum has been generated. Rather than being developed in a fully open fashion with adequate public review and comment, the curriculum appears to have been largely developed out of public view by people with ideological axes to grind.
I would hope that additional revisions be made to the proposed curriculum to address these issues.
Sincerely, William Jacobs, Ph. D.
