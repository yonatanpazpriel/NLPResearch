Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson introduces students to some of the complex people and concepts used to understand the experience of people of color in the United States. As can be seen in Appendix A, the purposeful terms hxstory, herstory, hxrstory, and ourstory, are used increasingly in Ethnic Studies classes and communities today, for two primary reasons:
The first is a form of resistance to patriarchal society and to shed light on the social injustices womxn have and currently face. Take a moment, to think about how hxstory was taught in high school that tend to leave out the contributions of womxn and those who do not gender identify, from the telling of "history." The second reason is to redefine the way "history" was told in educational spaces. We know that "history" has always been retold by those who won, the details, and representations have been skewed in the retelling. The "x" is meant to be an inclusive and progressive term that stands for the many different identities, struggles, and intersectionalities. We hold the "x" as a way to acknowledge our untold hxstories and collectively push forward to reclaim the lost." (Southeast Asian Retention Through Creating Hxstory, 2014)
As part of a larger unit on understanding the contributions and role that people of color have played in the building of the United States, this lesson on hxstorical figures guides students to explore individuals within a hxstorically oppressed community. Furthermore, students will

understand how these hxstorical figures contributed to a broader social movement that challenged racism, sexism or classism. Students will analyze the impact of that broader movement on the community and institutional structures, through research and analysis utilizing critical questions to guide their research and then presenting a biographical pictorial timeline significance PPT to the class.
Key Terms and Concepts: social movement, institutional racism,
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Conduct research utilizing the critical essential questions. 2. Create a pictorial presentation, with captions, timeline, poem and quotes 3. Strengthen their research, analytical reading and notetaking, presentation creation and
public speaking skills through presenting their research findings.
Essential Questions:
1. What was the upbringing, class background, life experiences and decisions made by the hxstorical figure?
2. What made this hxstorical figure and important person in the movement for racial equality? How did they challenge systems of white supremacy?
3. How did their leadership and achievements contribute to the movement for racial and economic equality?
4. What can we learn from this hxstorical figure about how we should challenge white supremacy today?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Teachers can let students choose a hxstorical figure from the list provided, depending on the students' interest. The teacher may assign students a hxstorical figure. Teachers can challenge students by choosing a hxstorical figure that is not from their ethnic background to expand their knowledge of other groups.
2. Research - Once all students have a hxstorical figure, walk through the steps of doing the research using the Source/Notes page. Make sure students are versed in evaluating valid sources on the internet making sure the sources are not biased, misleading or

nonfactual. Students should choose 2-3 valid sources on their hxstorical figure with each source covering a variety of information. Demonstrate how to read for factual information and write notes in the Source/Notes page. Ensure the source information is complete. Students should use the 4 essential questions to guide their research.
3. After the research is completed, students should prepare a visual biography PPT presentation which will include:
a. Title: Create a title using the name of your person with a picture also put your name, instructors name, subject & period b. Address all 4 essential questions in your presentation using photos, drawings, captions, bullet points c. Poem: Write a biography poem about your person d. Quotes: Collect 1-3 or more quotes from or about your person e. Illustrations: Use pictures or drawings highlighting your person's life and accomplishments f. Captions: Type appropriate captions to explain your illustrations g. Annotated Timeline: Show important events and dates relevant to your hxstorical figure.
4. Resume: Students will create a resume for their hxstorical figure.
5. The PPT will be followed up with the students writing a "Biographical Research Essay" using Modern Language Association documentation format.
6. Other considerations: Some of the figures on this list might be controversial. There are people who were controversial in their own lifetimes but people felt differently years later. Or there are people who were popular during their lifetimes who became controversial later on.
 Is this a controversial figure? Why would some people have strong negative or positive feelings about this figure?
Some of these figures are on the list because they have made key cultural contributions.
 Has your figure made a significant cultural contribution?

Culminating Activity
1. The final activity for students will be to become their hxstorical figure. This step will be accomplished by writing a speech in the voice of the individual they have been researching and by presenting that speech in costume to a group of their peers.
2. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a thirty-minute oral hxstory interview with their interviewees, and transcribe at least one interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for copies of old pictures, images of relics that hold some significant meaning or value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.
3. Students are allotted three days to work on their presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an opportunity to practice their presentations with peer to peer and peer to small group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.
4. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations, students in the audience should be active listeners, taking notes, and asking follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using "the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.
5. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by coordinating a community presentation event.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Peer assessments are used to help students refine their PPT presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the practice groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having difficulty with the assignment.
 During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students' presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.

 Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student presenters.

Appendix A (Distinct from this Lesson)
The following "Language of Ethnic Studies" section can be integrated into the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum's Introduction Chapter.
The Language of Ethnic Studies
Ethnic Studies may incorporate purposeful academic language and terminology, including intentional respellings, to challenge various forms of oppression and marginalization. For instance, it is widely recognized that the worldviews and perspectives of women, or womxn, and Black, Indigenous, People of Color figures and communities have been largely absent, marginalized, and/or distorted in the traditional discipline of history. This is recognized by Ethnic Studies practitioners, as a dimension of white supremacy and patriarchy that is dominant in the K-12 curriculum. Thus, in Ethnic Studies classes, there may be challenges to this disciplinary marginalization at the linguistic level, with the usage of spellings including herstory, hxstory, hxrstory, ourstory, or other conceptions students may emerge with -- each with intentionality and purpose. Sometimes the purpose may relate to etymology (word origins), other times, such as in the case of the variations of hxstory, the purpose relates more directly to the orthography (visual) and phonemic (sonic) dimensions of the terms. Many examples can be found in Appendix B.
Thus, Ethnic Studies reserves the right to cultivate its own disciplinary language and spelling conventions, and this is honored with students, as part of what sociolinguists of color refer to as its language and spelling ideology as a discipline.
These language conventions are not foregrounded in this model curriculum for those just beginning familiarity with Ethnic Studies (as of the Sept 2020 draft), however, educators should note that such conventions continue to grow and are used within Ethnic Studies classes and communities. This dimension of the field is also interdisciplinary (or xdisciplinary) with other fields, including certain genres of English Language Arts, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Hip Hop Studies, Philosophy and Linguistics -- as the language of Ethnic Studies continues to evolve.
