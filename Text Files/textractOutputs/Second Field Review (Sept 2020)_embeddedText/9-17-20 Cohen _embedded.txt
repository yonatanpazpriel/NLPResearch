To our elected leaders, My children are being harassed because of their religion even today! Ignorance is not excuse. Education is available. We can make a change. https://www.marinij.com/2020/09/10/marin-educators-parents-denounce-hate-speechtargeting-jewish-students/ Haven't we all had enough of hate and deviseness! I urge you to consider this for the sake of all children and young adults: 1. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent. 2. An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010. 3. Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. 4. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
Thank you for making these important changes now! I have copied my children show them there is hope in this free society to be Jewish and look to our leaders to protect their freedom. Do not let this ideal down. Bruce Cohen
