There must be fair and transparent review of proposed curriculum and any "additional chapter" - particularly if it might contain anti-Jewish teaching. Is this being hidden from the public?! The prior curriculum addressing Israel was outrageous and hatefully anti-Jewish. Obvious to anyone who is not an anti-semite.
Open the sample chapter up for public review and comment with adequate time and a process for revision.
Why teach hate?
