Hi,
Although I live in New Jersey, this plea is personal. Two of my three sons are raising their families in California and I am concerned about proposed changes to the Ethnic Studies curriculum that are due to be revealed tomorrow - after the comment period will have essentially ended.
� Regarding the issue of transparency, I support the view of FULL transparency, which doesn't look like it will happen in this situation. The announcement of an additional chapter was made just hours prior to the IQC meeting on August 13th, but will not allow for comments. Why is the new chapter hidden from us? We have reason to suspect it's because it contains material that was supposed to have been removed.
� Regarding the chapter on American Jews, which for some strange reason chooses to compare Jewish Americans to Irish Americans . . .
o The offending material teaches that Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnicity - a position charged with negativity and proven to contribute to the frequently noted recent rise in antisemitism. PBS broadcast a full-length special in early 2020 on this rise.
o Jews have never stopped being discriminated against, hated, and of course, the target of several violent and deathly attacks.
o For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the overt hatred Jews experience.

� Regarding problematic citations . . . many of the citations in this curriculum are from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel authors, which raises concerns on what teachers will find when they use the sources for supplemental content
If the content team (re)inserts material that will promote negative associations with regard to Jewish Americans - or ANY group included in the new curriculum - the whole intent behind the new curriculum may be suspect.
Make the content POSITIVE or NEUTRAL! Promote acceptance and understanding. It's outrageous to think the result might be exactly the opposite of the lofty goals that led to the creation of the program in the first place! The Southern Poverty Law Center's Teaching Tolerance program is an excellent place to look for guidance if you really want to do a good job.
I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by
1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and
inclusive Jewish narrative 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of
discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of Boycott, Divestiture and Saction (BDS).
Thank you.
