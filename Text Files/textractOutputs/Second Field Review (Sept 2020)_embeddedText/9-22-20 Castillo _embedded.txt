Hi,
Please include Jewish Americans - especially non-white Jews, including but not limited to BIPOC Jews, Latinx, Asian, and descendants of Jewish refugees from the Middle East and North Africa. Your ethnic studies curriculum cannot claim to be inclusive and exclude your diverse student body.
Thanks!
Allison
