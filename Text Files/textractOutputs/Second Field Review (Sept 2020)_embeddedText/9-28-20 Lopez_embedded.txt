Dear IQC,
After hearing from a dear family member about the new curriculum and what it entails I've come to the conclusion that the new curriculum would support antisemetic sentiments. I have copied his concerns below:
I am deeply troubled about the following events that have transpired with the new draft curriculum for Ethnic Studies (ESMC):
1. An initial draft that was clearly antisemitic and anti-Israel in its content 2. A commitment to have an open and transparent process that was clearly violated
by the "stroke of midnight" inclusion of Arab-Americans when there had been an agreement that it would only cover four traditional ethnic studies groups ï¿½ African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and Latinx Americans. 3. A second draft that remains fundamentally flawed
I hope you take my comments in stride and think deeply about the unintended consequences of the new curriculum.
Kind regards, Kailey
