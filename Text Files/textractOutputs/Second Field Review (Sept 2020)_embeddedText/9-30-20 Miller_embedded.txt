Dear CDE,
BDS echoes exactly the Nazis' first step in Jewish genocide: the boycott and theft of Jewish-owned businesses only to starve and demoralize the Jewish people. Viscous blind prejudice drives BDS otherwise they would boycott China due to ongoing Uighur incarceration and Myanmar due to Rohynga genocide, and India where Muslims have been downgraded to 2nd class citizens. Ironically it is the Rock Star Jewish groups that call out the mistreatment of their Muslim communities, while Muslim countries stay silent. Why? To focus on the populations` grievance against Israel, the only Jewish State, maintains anger on a pretend enemy and keeps Muslims from rebelling against their own repressive regimes.
You promised that you would keep antisemitism and BDS out of our school curriculum. However you're consulting with organizations who openly state they want to restore the old hateful and politically biased curriculum. On top of that, you've inserted a chapter, in cooperation with groups that want the old version, that has been made unavailable to the public. I demand transparency and that you recommit to keeping BDS and antisemitism out of our schools. Tamara Miller
