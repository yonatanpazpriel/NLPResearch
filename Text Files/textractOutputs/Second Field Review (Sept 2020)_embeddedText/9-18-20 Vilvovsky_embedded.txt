I am a Jewish student in America, and am requesting that your curriculum represents ALL students including Jews, who have and will experience anti-semitism. Do NOT begin and end our story with the Holocaust. Put us in your Ethnic studies curriculum. All students and people's deserve to be heard, and Jews make up 2% of America and 0.2% of the world population. If you don't teach non-Jews about us, we will continue to be powerless, with no help or understanding from those around us. Excluding us from this curriculum is DANGEROUS. We are calling for the curriculum to: -teach about anti-Semitism in ALL forms -represent the diversity of the Jewish community -include a lesson plan about all middleeastern communities including Jews, Berbers, Kurds, Druze, Turks, Persians, etc.
