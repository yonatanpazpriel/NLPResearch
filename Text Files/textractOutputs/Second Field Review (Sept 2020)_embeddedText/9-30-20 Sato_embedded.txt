From: Kiyo Sato Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 8:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I received a copy of Currents yesterday with your article ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM STILL BAD with the deadline of today, September 30, for comments.
A bit about myself: I am a retired Preschool Nurse, a frequent speaker with our VFW Nisei Post 8985 on EO 9066 to students from elementary through college level, and an adoptive mother of four children.
These are my observations: Ethnic Studies attempt to teach our students to respect each other's differences when they have already formed their own ideas. To teach children to respect each other starts early in life. Mine began when I started first grade in Edward Kelley School with Miss Cox and her 52 children of Italian, Portuguese, Mexican, Japanese and Caucasian backgrounds, all in one room.
When my father was teaching me to read, Miss Cox said: "You don't have to teach her, Mr. Sato. She's picking up your accent. She'll do just fine."
And so it was with our different immigrant accents and ways. We did fine. And those living still gather for reunions, continuing to respect and enjoy each other.
On a personal note, my children bring six racial strains, but that has never been an issue. More importantly, they bear the trauma of early separation and rejection.
My father said to me: "One of these days we are all going to be mixed up like your family and there won't be racial prejudice."
And so it is now in our fifth generation since my parents immigration with almost one hundred persons. We are black to white and every color in between.
Children don't let color of skin get in the way of friendships. Ethnic Studies need to be a part of parenting and Early Childhood Education.
I will be glad to answer any questions.
Very best wishes for a successful program.
