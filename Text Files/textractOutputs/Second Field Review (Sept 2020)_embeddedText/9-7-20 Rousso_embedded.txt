Dear CFIRD
I am trying to understand the "model guidelines" and how one can review them for comment. Specifically, I have heard informally that there was a "last minute change" to the "definition" of "Asian" to "include Palestinians." Is this correct? If so, how does one see that please?
Thank you. Nora Rousso Los Gatos
