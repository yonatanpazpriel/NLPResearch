Superintendent Tony Thurmond,
It is with great disappointment that I have heard of the exclusion of the Asian America experience in America. Once again-we are seeing a message, that only those with a European heritage: matters. The Asian American experiences is not only unique-but it is the truth of how minorities are marginalized-and, perhaps that is what is feared: the truth.
The truth is about the contributions of Asian Americans who do not take things for granted. Their history in America is a lesson in discrimination and overcoming adversity. No other ethnic group was forced to give up everything and incarcerated without due process only because of their ethnicity. This was a lesson that American paid dearly for and this lesson should be learned so that it is not repeated-ever again. My Japanese grandparents and my American parents, uncles and aunts were incarcerated during WWII. They lost their home, their livelihood and an opportunity for a better future. After their incarceration, they struggled to contribute to society in all professions. This is a story that must be taught and told so that it never happens again.
America should embrace the richness of the contributions and history by all ethnicities INCLUDING Asian American. Without this-misunderstanding and discrimination is cultivated in future generations. This is the legacy that you will leave, if this history is excluded from the State curriculum.
I support the true history and stories of those who contributed to a better America. I urge you too, to let these stories be shared and taught to everyone.
