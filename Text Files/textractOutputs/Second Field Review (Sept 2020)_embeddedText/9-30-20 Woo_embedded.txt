My name is Darrel Woo and I am a Chinese American,
I am a 5th generation Chinese American from my mother's side and the son of an immigrant by way of my father. My father was a soldier in World War II, fighting with the Flying Tigers in the China Burma India Theater. I am a strong supporter of Ethnic Studies, not only for myself, but for Asian American Pacific Islander everywhere.
I oppose Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in its current form. Chinese and Chinese American alone is insufficient. Cambodian and Cambodian Americans and Pan-Asian Units which were in the initial draft but not in the most recent draft must be restored. The California Department of Education curriculum must at least also include lesson plans for Japanese and Japanese Americans, Filipino and Filipino Americans, Korean and Korean Americans, Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans and Hmong and Hmong Americans, Laotian and Laotian American and Indian and Indian Americans. These people have all contributed to the fabric of America and America overseas.
I am proud to be an Chinese American, and want my children and children's children to learn of their country and their contribution to America. Maybe later, Asian American Pacific Islander must be expanded to all the countries in the Pacific Rim.
Asian American Pacific Islanders as a pan-ethnic group must be incorporated into the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft adopted in November 2020 by the IQC.. Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies must be inclusive and equitable. .It has been 51 years since Ethnic Studies was founded in 1969 by young college students of color, including myself. We must ensure this inaugural K-12 curriculum is done right.
Thanks,
Darrel Woo
