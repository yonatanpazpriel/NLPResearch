Please thoroughly teach and disseminate the history and plight of American Jews with ancestral roots in the Middle East and North Africa. Over 750,000 Jews of Syrian, Iraqi, Egyptian and Iranian descent had to flee these countries after 1948 as a result of hatred and violence directed at them. Please include lessons on the history and prevention of anti-semitism. Refer to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition adopted by the U.S. State Department in 2010. AB 331 must demonstrate respect for all California citizens including those of American Jewish heritage. Now, more than ever, respect for all Americans and their diverse histories, cultures and contributions to our great State of California must be implemented. Anti-semitism is a form of bigotry and must be erased from our midst. No group, none whatsoever, has the right to defame another group. Arab-Americans must embrace their brothers and sisters of the Jewish faith and identity as all of us seek a more peaceful, inclusive and hope-filled world. Anti-Semitic and Anti-Israel comments must be purged and eliminated from the July 2020 ESMC draft. Thank you.
