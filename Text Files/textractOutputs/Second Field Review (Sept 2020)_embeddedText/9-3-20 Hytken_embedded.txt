From: Kent Hytken Sent: Thursday, September 3, 2020 11:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on ESMC
To: Ethnic Studies Curriculum, California.
The first draft was completely flawed and the second draft still presents issues, including discussions about reintroducing BDS into the curriculum.
I hope the Department of Education will ensure that this curriculum meets my standards that reintroducing BDS into the curriculum is not warranted for the education of the students and will incite prejudice.
Please do not allow it to be passed on to our local school boards.
Sincerely,
Kent Hytken
