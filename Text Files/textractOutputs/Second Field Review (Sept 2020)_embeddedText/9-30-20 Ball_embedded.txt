Hello, I am appalled to hear that the state is planning to insert an anti Semitic curriculum. Jews have been a persecuted minority for thousands of years in the Middle East and Europe. Acts of antisemitism in the US have risen to new heights under the Trump administration. Unfortunately, antisemitism thrives even more in the Arab world, and lies are being spread against Israel to justify over 1300 years of Muslim persecution of Jews. 99% of Jews in the Middle East were forced to flee to Israel. We are sick and tired of being insulted.
Best, Brian Ball
