If there is a high volume of comments re the inclusion of Palestinian materials and none about Israel and the Jews, I would like to know.
I find this horrifying. Every other group included experiences prejudice in the US. Why are Jews omitted? Hate crimes, violence, and graffiti are not sufficient? -Giselle Galper
