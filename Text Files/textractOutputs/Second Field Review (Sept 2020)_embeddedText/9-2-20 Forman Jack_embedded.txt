To the California Department of Education:
The ESMC is very important for all Californians, but it must remain focused on learning about the cultures of the diverse peoples that live in our state and stay free of political ideology. It is not helpful to introduce concepts like colonization, victimization, imperialism and privilege into a curriculum that should be teaching how the many ethnic and racial groups being studied have contributed so richly to American culture.
I am very concerned that territorial disputes and conflicts happening halfway around the world could be a part of the ESMC. In particular, the BDS movement that denies the right of Jews to have a homeland in the State of Israel because they are Jews has NO legitimate place in the curriculum. (It really shouldn't have a place in any curriculum, but that's another topic.) BDS is a hate group that espouses antisemitism, and it would be a disaster to include them as a positive entity within ESMC.
Keep politics out of education. It is a very slippery slope to introduce this divisive element into ESMC because, among other things, at the end of the day what goes around comes around.
