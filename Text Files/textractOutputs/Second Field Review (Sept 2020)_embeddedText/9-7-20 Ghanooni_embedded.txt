From: Eliza Ghanooni Sent: Sunday, September 6, 2020 5:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] AB 331
AB 331 invites hateful antisemitic rhetoric, which should never be allowed. There is no reason why Jews need to be attacked in order to end discrimination against minorities. In fact, that is extremely hypocritical and is literally inviting lawsuits against the state of California from various organizations that fight discrimination daily.
It is unfathomable that such curriculum would be not only allowed but endorsed by a state government in the United States. Many American citizens would be appalled by being forced to have their children learn to hate a particular race. It is unacceptable.
