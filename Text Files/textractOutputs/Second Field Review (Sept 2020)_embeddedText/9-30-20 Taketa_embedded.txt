Dear Superintendent Tony Thurmond, California Department of Education Ethnic Studies Curriculum Committee of California
I am in support of including the history, the contributions and the struggle and loss
of Civil Liberties of the Japanese Americans to be included in the ethnic studies curriculum being sponsored by your Department. We are at a critical juncture in our state and nation to represent our history as it occurred, to tell our history with its strengths and its injustices will facilitate opportunities to move forward with accurate information and remove educational knowledge and intellectual foundations built on falsehoods, myths and omissions, but with the intent to provide an inclusive history of the people who help shape and build our state and nation economy and the laws on which we live are and are governed by. A curriculum for our student that will allow for an inclusive telling of our history, the people who help build our great state, we will come to understand the issues that face us today day. It will reinforce and put value to the words "We the People" and the importance of our Bill of Rights and our desire to create a more perfect union.
Thank you
Victoria Taketa
