Dear committee,
As a custom publisher, XanEdu Publishing looks to partner with agencies/districts/schools who are frustrated with the limitations of traditional textbooks/learning materials, and are eager to replace them with open educational resources or custom curriculum. As you are continuing to build toward Ethnic Studies curriculum for California, we may be able to help.
We provide the tools and expertise for building curriculum that includes the most engaging and relevant resources, including resources that are copyrighted. The educational institution selects the materials they feel are best for their students, regardless of source. This can include parts of books (fiction and non-fiction), journal articles, newspaper articles, pictures, poetry... basically anything. We provide editorial support and audit those selections for copyright compliance. Then we can, as desired, find the copyright holders and negotiate royalties on behalf of the agency/school.
The result is the strongest, most relevant curriculum for your students, and protection from any copyright violations.
I'd love to engage with you to learn more about how we can support districts in California. If its relevant, I'm happy to share stories on how we have partnered with Departments of Education and districts across the country.
Would you be open to a short 20 minute zoom introduction?
"Often, teachers feel like they should stick with the exact language in the textbook, but our open custom solution provides an opportunity to adapt [the material] and make it appropriate for the students in their classroom." ï¿½ Whitney Whealdon, Director of Academic Content (former), LDOE
