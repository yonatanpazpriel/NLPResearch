From: Eden Rousso Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 2:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
Dear IQC:
Anti-Semitism is on the rise in the US and abroad, even in California. High school students are capable of acting and promoting virulent, anti-Jewish hatred. Education is the only means to combat such hatred; a curriculum that explores shared legacies is necessary. The proposed ethnic studies curriculum does not address the shared legacies of Jewish Americans with other "traditional" ethnic studies groups.
Therefore I implore you PLEASE to pledge to the following: 1. A sample lesson on Jewish Americans in Appendix B. 2. Addition of a lesson on Middle Eastern American Jews under the Asian American category in Appendix B. 3. Addition of a lesson on Middle Eastern Americans including Jews, Arabs, Iranians, and other large California ethnic communities under the Asian American category in Appendix B.
Signed, Eden Rousso
