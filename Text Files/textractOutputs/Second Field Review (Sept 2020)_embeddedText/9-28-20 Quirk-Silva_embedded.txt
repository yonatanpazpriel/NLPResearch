Dear Superintendent Thunnond,

I am writing this letter in support of the inclusion of Korean American Studies to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in our education system. I respectfully request that we include Korean American studies in the Asian American studies portion of the curriculum. My Assembly District has a large and growing Korean American population and I have seen how important the Korean American community has been in shaping the American landscape through its community activities, its contributions, and more.

For example, we cannot discuss the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest without including Korean Americans and the ethnic conflicts that arose during that period and how this contributed to the violence against and marginalization of Asian Americans. Korean Americans including Dr. Sammy Lee and Col. Young Oak Kim also helped shape this country through their actions, valor, and character. Dr. Lee won Olympic gold for America in 1948 and 1952 and was the first Asian American man to do so. Col. Kim was a U.S. Army officer who became the first Asian American man to lead a combat battalion on the field during the Korean War. He was also a World War II hero. His humanitarian efforts also shaped the landscape of Los Angeles through the founding of several nonprofits and organizations that help the youth, battered women, and minorities.

Korean American history and identity should be taught as part of the curriculum because this community played a major role in California and the country. Korean Americans founded the Willows Korean Aviation School/Corps in Willows, CA in 1920. The Korean Air Force views the school as its origin. To understand the Korean American community, its history and ethnic identity is to also understand the framework of our country and how this great nation is made up of minorities and their histories.

Also, California has recognized Korean Americans through two resolutions. I was a lead author on ACR 109, Hangul Day, which was passed on October 19, 2019 and recognizes Korean Americans as ''an integral part of mainstream American society and have made important contributions as Californians in the fields of finance, technology, law, medicine, education, sports, media, the arts, the military, and government, as well as in other areas."

California also recognized Korean American Day on January 13, 2020 by passing Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 142 citing that "with diligence, fortitude, and an enduring belief in the American dream, Korean immigrants have helped to tum emergent areas within the State of California into thriving and respectable communities, while raising their children to be productive Korean Americans."
The Korean American population has a rich history in the State of California and I urge you to include Korean American Studies in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely,
~ Quv,,lc-~
