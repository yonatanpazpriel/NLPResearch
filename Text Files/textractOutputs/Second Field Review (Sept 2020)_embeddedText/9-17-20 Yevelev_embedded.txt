Dear Sir or Madam,
I am son of the Holocaust survivor. My father Isak Yevelev by lucky chance was able to escape from Ghetto in Slutzk, Belarus at age 17. However 40 + people from our family were buried alive in the mass grave. Students of the American schools MUST know what antisemitism is.
Sincerely,
Igor Yevelev
