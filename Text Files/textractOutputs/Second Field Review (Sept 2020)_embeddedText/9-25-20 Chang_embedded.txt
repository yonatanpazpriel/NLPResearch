From: Edward Chang Sent: Friday, September 25, 2020 1:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Lesson plans
I would like to submit 3 lesson plans I developed on Korean American Experiences to be included in Ethnic Studies model curriculum. Appreciate your time and consideration.
In recognition of the legacy of Col. Young Oak Kim, the LAUSD named the new middle school as Young Oak Kim Academy in 2009. UC Riverside established the YOK Center for Korean American Studies in 2010. The State of California named a portion of I-5 near Fullerton as Col. Young Oak Kim Memorial Highway. He is a not only war hero but more importantly, humanitarian who championed civil rights and human rights for all minorities and women.
Thank you again.
-Professor of Ethnic Studies and founding director of the Young Oak Kim Center for Korean American Studies at UC Riverside

Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Sample Lesson 1: Korean American Experiences and Interethnic Relations: 11th � 12th Grade Levels.
Theme: History and Movement
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Koreatown in Los Angeles is an ethnic enclave whose formation and development are an integral part of America's multicultural history. The heart of Korean America is in Koreatown Los Angeles. Koreatown was a central hotspot of violence during the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest, and Korean Americans were thrust onto the national and international scenes where they were scapegoated, marginalized, and discriminated against. The media inflamed black-Korean conflict at the time, exposed the deep seeded interethnic issues plaguing inner-city communities. Interethnic relations and conflicts, racism, and police brutality against African Americans, fanned the flames of unrest in 1992. When the not-guilty verdicts of the police officers involved in the case of the beating of African American Rodney King came back, inner-city community residents rose up and protested.
Today, the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest resonates strongly with minorities whose voice is being channeled through the Black Lives Matter movement. Studying the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest provides a framework for students to understand and apply to current events. The interethnic conflict between Korean Americans, African Americans, coupled with

the socio-economic issues and police brutality issues, are relevant to this day. The interethnic, socio-economic and police brutality issues that African Americans protested about in 1992 are the same issues the BLM movement is fighting against now. Thus, it is important to include such a major event in ethnic studies curriculum because the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest is a perfect case study in the field and is applicable to current events.
In the aftermath of the uprising, the Korean American community transformed and became visible by exercising their political, social, and community voices.
The goal of this lesson is to provide an overview of the historic, ethnic, political, and sociocultural background of Koreatown to understand the formation of the Korean American community as we know it today. The goal is also to introduce concepts in interethnic relations/studies through the lens of the black-Korean conflict and contextualize this with current events. The lesson uses the voices of Korean Americans, articles, textbooks, documentaries, and interviews.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, oral history, Koreatown, 1992 L.A. Civil unrest, 1965 Immigration Act, Los Angeles, Interethnic Relations.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Better understand the diverse experiences of Korean Americans by engaging a range of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, textbooks, documentaries, and scholarly articles.
� Introduce concepts in interethnic relations/studies through the lens of the blackKorean conflict and contextualize this with current events.
� Conduct an interview of someone who was there during the L.A. Civil unrest or who is Korean American. Students will develop and ask questions that explore the lived experiences of the subject being interviewed. Students will transcribe the interview and write a short essay on what they learned about the Korean

American community through the interview. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure interviews, transcriptions, and essays.
Essential Questions:
1. What is the history of Koreatown and its formation?
2. How did the 1992 Los Angeles Civil unrest effect and transform the Korean American community?
3. Why is the Korean American experience important to understand within the context of Asian American studies and U.S. history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone here has experiences or knows someone with experiences that they feel could help others better understand this content, feel free to add to our discussions"
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Korean Americans and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about Korean American history and identity via PowerPoint or other presentation method. The teacher asks students if they have questions about Korean Americans and writes them on the white board. Arirang (documentary on Korean American history by Tom Coffman) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jELVFvva720&feature=youtu.be
4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Korean American community in the U.S. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.

5. The teacher and students discuss the quick facts and determine which of the essential questions were answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers together.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Korean American experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a short history video about the Korean American community. The teacher notes that the students should think about the hardships and difficulties immigrants experienced coming to the U.S. The teacher also asks students to take note of how the film addresses racism and discrimination.
"Footsteps of Korean Americans" a short Documentary about the experiences of Koreans in the United States gives a concise overview of when, how, why, Koreans came to America. The film also identifies major moments in Korean American history that helped define the United States and also discusses the 1992 L.A. Civil unrest, racism, marginalization, and discrimination. The film also touches on the black-Korean conflict that was fueled by negative media coverage. The documentary's narrative shows the development of the Korean American community within the context of race relations in the United States. The film ends on a positive note with an overview of how Korean Americans are facing and dealing with the racial divide in the U.S. and at the same time learning to deal with its newfound identity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtOtB5yuQ (37 minutes).
7. The teacher shows two to three videos from the Korean American Oral Histories Archive hosted by the YOK Center, UC Riverside. The videos are of Korean Americans who talk about their lives and experiences in the United States. As students watch them, they should think about how these individuals have developed their identity as being Korean American within the context of race and identity. http://kaoralhistories-yokcenter.weebly.com.
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about this question: How do these Korean Americans describe

their experiences and how racism and discrimination effected their lives? Ask students to think for about a minute quietly then have them write for two to three minutes on their own. Afterward, students will be paired and asked to share their thoughts with a partner. Students can be put into breakout sessions for online courses or paired in class at random for in person teaching.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� being caught between two worlds, Korean Americans (immigrants), feel the pressures and the divide in the U.S. along racial lines, especially as they enter small businesses and inner-city communities
� Koreatown's development over the century; its evolution from small unknown community to a recognized ethnic enclave
� the racial inequalities and mistreatment of Korean Americans during the 1992 L.A. Civil unrest and the historic nature of this scenario and how it applies to all Asian Americans
� the racial and socioeconomic disparities that exist in the United States for minority communities including Asian Americans, African Americans, etc.
� learning how Korean Americans embraced their new host society and became visible after the 1992 L.A. Civil unrest and how Koreatown emerged from the ashes of the violence and became a hotspot for culture, food, and all things Korean in America
� developing an identity of their own as proud Korean Americans
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Memoir of a Cashier: Korean Americans, Racism, and Riots." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Korean American during the tumultuous 1990s and during the 1992 L.A. Civil unrest? (pages 57-62, "Memoir of a Cashier: Korean Americans, Racism, and Riots" by Carol Park.)

a. As students read the excerpt, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Carol Park, what was the black-Korean conflict?
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Similar to other minorities, Korean Americans were marginalized and discriminated against throughout U.S. history.
ii. The invisibility and categorization off Asian American and Pacific Islander groups as model minorities needs to be recognized and discussed.
iii. Korean American history is important and should be taught about because of pivotal moments like the 1992 L.A. Civil unrest.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14 of the framework includes a section (pages 297-299) on California's involvement in the civil rights movement during the 1960s and discrimination as well as modern immigration, and the state's post-1965 Immigration Act demographics. The chapter asks two essential questions where the Korean American experience and the L.A. Civil unrest could fit in under the Asian American studies curriculum.
� What did protests and frustrations expressed by Californians in the late Cold War Era reveal about the state?
� In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century?

10. Assessment � To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments:
a. Write one-to-three paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or
b. Discussion group exercise where students collectively write a paper about the Korean American experience and answering the two essential questions. Each student can be paired with one other student or there can be groups of three. Each student in the group writes one paragraph.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: See Step 10 above.

Theme: History, War, Humanitarianism, Community Service, and People
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4
Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Col. Young Oak Kim was a renowned war hero who served during World War II and the Korean War. Col. Kim helped lead the mostly Japanese American Nisei unit, the 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team. Although he was Korean American, Col. Kim stressed that color lines and racial divides had no place in the United States. Born in Los Angeles, CA he attended Belmont High School and became a humanitarian after retiring from the U.S. Army in 1972. Col. Kim helped shape the landscape of Los Angeles through his humanitarian work by creating, establishing, and participating in the formation of several nonprofits still in operation today. He helped to create the Koreatown Youth and Community Center, Korean Health Education Information and Research Center, Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles and helped battered women by founding the Center for the Pacific Asian Family. He also helped children through other nonprofits. His work has left lasting change in California still palpable through the organizations he helped establish and which continue to operate today.

He was the first minority to lead a combat battalion on the field during the Korean War. Col. Kim is an exemplary individual whose life embodies what it means to be living in multiracial America and the challenges he faced and overcame is part of the history of California that should be recognized. This lesson uses videos, interviews of Col. Kim from the USC archives, books, and articles to illustrate how Korean Americans navigate the multiethnic landscape of California and the United States.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, War Heroes, Humanitarians, Los Angeles, World War II, Korean War, Asian American, ethnicity, U.S. Army, multicultural, multiethnic.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Better understand the Korean American experience and multiethnic America through the lens of Col. Young Oak Kim's life as a war hero and humanitarian who helped shaped the landscape of Los Angeles.
� Write an essay, report, or create a video about the life of Col. Young Oak Kim. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure their essay writing skills and learn how to use video presentations, which is an essential skill to have in the online learning platform.
Essential Questions:
1. How did World War II and the Korean War change how Asian Americans are viewed and treated in the United States.?
2. Why is it important to study the stories of individuals like Col. Young Oak Kim in ethnic studies?
3. Col. Young Oak Kim's story demonstrates how racism permeated even the U.S. military. Yet, Col. Kim overcame the racial divides. What lessons can we learn from his story when it comes to racism?
Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone has any experiences that can contribute to the understanding of racial inequalities and ethnic divides, feel free to add to our discussion."
2. The teacher tells students they are going to learn about Col. Young Oak Kim and his Korean American experience. The teacher has students focus on the three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about Col. Kim and the Korean American community. The teacher asks students if they have questions about the Korean Americans and their role in Los Angeles and other California communities, and writes them on the white board.
4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about Col. Young Oak Kim and the Korean American community in the U.S. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.
5. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about racism and immigration in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher plays an audio recording interview of Col. Young Oak Kim. The teacher asks students to think about how racism is not just something that happens on the streets but permeates even the military like how Col. Kim experienced it. Also, the teacher asks students to think about how Col. Kim overcame racial divides and became a humanitarian after retiring from the U.S. Army:
"Col. Young Oak Kim" short video on who the hero/humanitarian was created and published by the Council of Korean Americans. The video is a succinct narrative about Col. Kim and his experience in the U.S. Army and how he looked passed ethnic divides and became a war hero and humanitarian. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvmoNQS6GOc (4 mins and 30 seconds).

7. The teacher shows plays two interviews of Col. Young Oak Kim talking about his early life, his parents' immigration experience to the United States, and later about his personal life and the founding of the Go For Broke Monument in Los Angeles. As students listen, they should think about how Col. Kim developed his Korean American identity and overcame ethnic boundaries and racism. developed their identity as being Hmong American. As students watch, they should consider what it is like to be a Korean American/minority struggling through racial barriers like Col. Kim did. Source: "Col. Young Oak Kim Oral History: Segment 1 and Segment 2." http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/search/field/filena/searchterm/KADAYoungoakkim01;KADA-Youngoakkim01.wave
http://www.goforbroke.org/learn/archives/oral_histories_videos.php?clip=047A12
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (How Col. Kim describes his parents' experiences as immigrants in America?) for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Being caught between two worlds, as a Korean born in America, Col. Kim learned to find his identity in the military and in civilian life by understanding he is both identities and bridging the cultural gap meant embracing both identities.
� The frustration Col. Kim felt being told he would be transferred out of the 100th battalion because of ethnic conflict between Japanese Americans and Korean Americans. All Col. Kim wanted to do was fight for freedom and look beyond the racial paradigms.

� Feeling proud to be a Korean American who looked past racial divides and overcame discrimination and succeeded in the military and as a humanitarian.
� How Col. Kim learned to embrace his heritage and culture and earn the respect and trust of his military unit and of community.
� How Col. Kim realized the importance of humanitarian work and creating a bridge between Korean, Japanese, and Americans through the Go For Broke monument construction in Los Angeles.
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Unsung Hero: The Story of Col. Young Oak Kim." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Hmong American male? (pages 360-368, Chapter 28, "Candlelight" by Woo Sung Han. Translated by Edward T. Chang).
a. As students read the excerpt, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the essential questions and any questions that may have come up during discussion using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Woo Sung Han, what contributions did Col. Kim make to "not only the Japanese American community, but ultimately to the progress of civil rights of all racial minority communities in the United States?"
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Asian Americans were often looked over and seen as "Model Minorities" and yet Col. Kim was visible, strong, and courageous as a war hero and humanitarian.

ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups
regarding their contributions to society and in war needs to be
studied to better understand how ethnic minorities are treated in the
United States military and as civilians.
iii. Korean Americans are not discussed enough in Asian American
studies and yet individuals such as Col. Kim played a huge and
important role in the U.S. military and in the community for Asian
American civil rights, social justice, and advancement.
iv. Implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too
small of a community to care about by political leaders and as
demonstrated by Col. Kim's story, by U.S. military leaders, must be
discussed to show how racism and discrimination is systemic.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14, page 310 of the framework includes a section on Ethnic Studies and asks these important questions:
How have race and ethnicity been constructed in the United States, and how have they changed over time?
How do race and ethnicity continue to shape the United States and contemporary issues?
The story of Col. Kim falls in line with the chapter's definition of Ethnic Studies which is an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses many subject areas including history, literature, economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science. It emerged to both address content considered missing from traditional curriculum and to encourage critical engagement.
As a field, ethnic studies seeks to empower all students to engage socially and politically and to think critically about the world around them. It is important for ethnic studies courses to document the experiences of people of color in order for students to construct counter-narratives and develop a more complex understanding of the human experience. The afore mentioned sentence is exactly where the lesson of Col. Young Oak Kim can be applied. Through ethnic studies, students should develop respect for cultural diversity and see the advantages of inclusion.
10. Assessment � To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can
choose one of two assignments:

a. Write one-to-three paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or
b. Discussion group exercise where students are paired in groups of two or three. Each group writes a paragraph about what they learned, and which addresses the essential questions. The group chooses a presenter and they read their work aloud. Then a larger discussion can be held addressing their thoughts about the topics.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: See Step 10 above.

Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
� Sample Lesson 8: Community, Struggle, Voice, Identity: Korean American Leader Dosan Ahn Chang Ho: 7th � 8th Grade Levels.
Theme: Identity, Community/First Koreatown USA, Voice, Racism
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4
Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.6�8.1, 6-8.2, 6-8.7, 6-8.10
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Dosan Ahn Chang Ho was a Korean American leader and Korean patriot who founded the first organized-Korean American settlement in the United States in early 1905. He was a political and Korean independence activist who fought for the rights of Koreans in the U.S. and around the world. He raised the Korean American voice and identity in the early 1900s. Dosan also created a Korean Labor Bureau in Riverside, CA to help Korean workers find better jobs and working conditions. Dosan also established several Korean organizations in the U.S. in the hopes his community would gain voice and identity in America. The lesson demonstrates the struggles ethnic minorities like Korean Americans had to go through in the early 20th century.
Today, there is a Dosan Ahn Chang Ho statue in Riverside, CA commemorating his work. Also, the Korean National Association building in Los Angeles is still standing and serves as a reminder of the early-Korean American community's independence efforts and doubles as a museum. In 2002, the I-10/I-110 interchange was named the "Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange" and is a marker of the diversity of our nation's roots and future.

This lesson uses videos, books, and articles to illustrate how Korean Americans navigated the multiethnic landscape of California and the United States in the early 1900s with Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's help and leadership.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, First Koreatown USA, identity, ethnic voice, multicultural, multiethnic, labor.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� Better understand the Korean American experience and multiethnic America through the story and lives of the Koreans who lived at Pachappa Camp, the first Koreatown USA established by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho in 1905.
� Write an essay, report, or video about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's efforts to raise Korean American voice and identity through his organizations, civic activity, and labor management efforts through the Korean Labor Bureau. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure their essay writing skills and learn how to use video presentations, which is an essential skill to have in the online learning platform.
Essential Questions:
1. Why is it important to study the stories of ethnic minorities like Koreans in the United States?
2. What do the struggles for voice and identity by Korean Americans reveal about America's racial history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Korean Americans through the story of Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and his efforts to raise the voice and identity of the small community, (read essential questions 1�2 aloud).

2. The teacher presents some basic information about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and the early Korean American community. The teacher asks students if they have questions about Korean Americans and writes them on the white board.
3. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the early-Korean American community and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.
4. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
5. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Korean American experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a clip from a video about Korean Americans and the early community during the early 20th century. Note the students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured as they looked for labor, shelter, and identity in the United States:
"Footsteps of Korean Americans," a short Documentary about the experiences of Koreans in the United States gives a concise overview of when, how, why, Koreans came to America. The film covers Korean American community development and identity in the early 1900s and discusses Dosan and Pachappa Camp. The documentary's narrative shows the development of the Korean American community within the context of race relations in the United States. The film ends on a positive note with an overview of how Korean Americans are facing and dealing with the racial divide in the U.S. and at the same time learning to deal with its newfound identity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtOtB5yuQ (37 minutes total. Only show the first 9 minutes and 25 seconds on Pachappa and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho). 6. The teacher shows a short video about Pachappa Camp published by the University of California Riverside June 2019. As students watch the short video describing the camp and the early-Korean American community, they should

think about how these Korean Americans lived, struggled, and developed their identities and voices during the early 1900s when anti-Asian sentiment was high.. https://youtu.be/YwylsG066I8.
7. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (For example: What were some of the struggles Korean Americans faced in the early 1900s?) Students should think for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Korean Americans were struggling for voice and identity because their homeland was no longer a country but a colony of Japan during the early 1900s. Thus, Korean Americans faced double racism and oppression from the Japanese and from Americans whose anti-Asian sentiments were high.
� Korean Americans must have felt a great deal of frustration and sadness at the loss of their homeland to Japan.
� Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and other Korean American leaders worked for the independence of Korea and established organizations and communities like Pachappa Camp to help raise the voice and identity of their people.
� Korean Americans learned to embrace both their host country's culture and keep their heritage and culture while pursuing independence activities.
� Ultimately, Korean Americans developed an identity of their own.
8. Have students read Chapter 2, pages 15-30 from Korean Americans: A Concise History. As they read the excerpt, students should think about: What it must have been like for Korean Americans who struggled for the freedom of their homeland

while facing racism in the United States? (pages 15-30, Korean Americans: A Concise History by Edward T. Chang and Carol K. Park).
a. As students read the chapter, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the authors, Chang and Lee, what happened to the Korean American community in the early 1900s and how did they gain their voice and identity? (See pages 23-25).
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Racism and discrimination were and are issues to this day. Korean Americans and Asian Americans continue to deal with the issues as do other minorities in the United States.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding historic oppression and racism is marginalized and should be discussed using lessons like this on Korean Americans and other Asian groups.
iii. Minority communities were pillars of strength and places of congregation and learning. The story of Pachappa Camp, founded by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, demonstrates how minority stories actually make up the fabric of U.S. history.
iv. Implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too small of a community to care about by political leaders or documented by historians, must be discussed to show how racism and discrimination are systemic.

Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework: -
Chapter 12 of the framework includes a section (pages 272-276) on how the U.S. changed post-Civil War Era. During the early 1900s the U.S. population began to shift and grow. The chapter asks "Who came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century? Why did they come? What was their experience like when they arrived?" Students will learn about the Korean American role in the changing demographics and landscape of California and the United States.
9. Assessment � To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments:
a. Write one-to-three paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or
b. Discussion group exercise where students are paired in groups of two or three. Each group writes a paragraph about what they learned, and which addresses the essential questions. The group chooses a presenter and they read their work aloud. Then a larger discussion can be held addressing their thoughts about the topics.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: See Step 10 above.
