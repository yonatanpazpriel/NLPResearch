From: Alexandra Moses Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 2:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include the Jewish-American experience.
We live with the daily ongoing threat of anti-Semitism. We need to teach about the history of the Jewish-American experience. California students need to understand how refugees become strong American citizens and contribute to our democracy. We need to teach to stop anti-Semitism at all levels. Thank you for listening and reading. We need your help. Alexandra Moses
