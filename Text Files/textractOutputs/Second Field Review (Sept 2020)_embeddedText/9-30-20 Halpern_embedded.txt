Dear Ethnic Studies Committee: As you plan for a more inclusive curriculum, it is critical to include information about the Holocaust and centuries of prejudice against Jews. Sadly too many young adults have no knowledge of these horrendous events. Could it happen again? Yes, unless we provide our future adults with the knowledge and understanding of what and how the Holocaust happened. Sincerely yours, Diane F. Halpern ************************************* Diane F.
