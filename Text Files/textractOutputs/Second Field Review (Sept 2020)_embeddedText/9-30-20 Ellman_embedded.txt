From: David Ellman Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 1:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concerns about curriculum regarding how Jewish people are portrayed
Dear All parties making determination,
It is clearly important to have an ethnic class to educate students about all our people's history and heritage.
The Jewish people, like all other groups, deserve equal treatment.
I would respectfully request you to note and attend my following concerns:-
1. There should be an accurate description of anti - semitism and lesson plans around this topic. Jewish children are harassed daily with anti Semitic statements and actions at school and on line. Sadly the situation is dramatically becoming worse.
2. There needs to be transparency with the development of the curriculum and a reasonable ability to comment throughout the process.
3. There needs to be a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community - including the Ashkenazi, Sephardic , and Jews of color.
4. The lesson plan on Arab Americans should include the relationship with Jewish Americans who have settled from Arab lands that include those refugees from North Africa and Middle Eastern countries
Thank you for your consideration
Yours sincerely
David Ellman La Jolla California
