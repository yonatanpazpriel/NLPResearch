From: Emily Green Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 2:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Jewish Studies in Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
Please include unbiased, inclusionary discussions of Jewish people in the ESMC. This includes more Jewish history and discussion than the Holocaust, and discussion on Jewish people from Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Please discuss Mizrahi Jews from Middle Eastern countries as well as other non-Arab/Muslim ethnic groups such as Druze, Zoroastrian, and Kurdish people. Please provide a multi-sided, unbiased view of Israel and the Middle East, and eliminate any biased talking points such as "Zionism is a racist colonial project" which originated from the USSR.
There is already too much hate in this world. Please do not contribute to it.
Thank you, Emily Green
