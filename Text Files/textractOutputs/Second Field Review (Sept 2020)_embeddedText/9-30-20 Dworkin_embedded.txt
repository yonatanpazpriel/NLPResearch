I have had an opportunity to review the latest iteration of the Ethnic Studies Guideline. It appears you have expanded the subject groups from 4 to 6, now including Arab Americans as well as Pavcific Islanders as a minority. It seems that the Jewish community has been neglected. American Jews are an integral part of the American Experience. They comprise a diverse population within the group including Eastern European, Middle Eastern, Black Jews, etc. All of these groups have a story to tell and should be included in any study of the diverse ethnicity of our country.
Also Anti Semitism should be studied and properly defined. The widely accepted definition of Anti Semitism is that used by the US Department of State as well as The Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. The ADL can provide guidance regarding this subject.
I hope in the future your work will be transparent and will allow for public comment before the final version of this document is published.
Thank you Howard Dworkin
