"Thus, premodern antisemitism took theformof accusations against theJews for not acceptinr Christianity as atrue religion." This is a quote from your curriculum on genocide, but it is not true. Jews always accept Christianity as a TRUE RELIGION. Jews did not accept Christianity as THEIR religion. In other words, Christians have always insisted that Jews convert to Christianity. Christians do not give Jews freedom of religion. That is still true today, and, as such, antisemitism is still true today in Christians who expect Jews to convert to Christianity. Please correct and reword your curriculum on genocide to reflect this.
Thanks Lois
