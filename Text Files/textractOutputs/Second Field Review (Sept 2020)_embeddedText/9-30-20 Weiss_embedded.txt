Dear Ethnic Studies Curriculum Committee,
I am writing to you because of my concern that many citations in the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum are from sources that promote BDS/anti-Israel authors, and that teachers will use these sources for supplemental content. In addition, the public commenting period, which began on September 1 to provide feedback prior to the final revisions, is insufficient as we were given an additional chapter just hours prior to the IQC meeting on August 13th. I am extremely concerned that this chapter will be the source of more BDS.
The intent of the curriculum review is to provide full transparency in curriculum development and implementation. Unfortunately, this transparency has been breeched in this intended communication relationship when we were sprung with last-minute decisions. Specific misleading and/or erroneous statements in the American Jews Chapter include, but are not limited to:
� comparing American Jews to Irish Americans, � teaching how Jewish Americans have become a privileged ethnicity, � comparing Jewish Americans to white supremacists, and � blaming Jews for racial injustice in America.
Jews have never stopped being discriminated against, hated, and of course, the target of several violent and deathly attacks. For a curriculum whose goal it is to educate about minorities and their struggles, this would in fact be doing the opposite by contributing to the misunderstandings of Jewish Americans and thus fueling the targeted hatred we experience.
I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by:
� Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment, � Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive
Jewish narrative, including Jewish and Israeli contributions to medicine, science and the world, and � Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS.
Thank you for considering my concerns and making the appropriate changes to the proposed curriculum.
Richard Weiss
