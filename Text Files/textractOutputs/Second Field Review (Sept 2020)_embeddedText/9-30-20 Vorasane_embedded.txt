Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Include lesson plans on Laotian Americans, Southeast Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group), specifically curricula on:  Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community  Laotian Americans the impact of US foreign policies towards Southeast Asia , its population and the outcome in immigration policies with diverse groups of Lao into the US secondary post 1975 and 1980.
2. At a minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Southeast Asian Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
The Laotian American community rallies behind advancing education equity to ensure that the tales of the unbreakable spirit of the Laotian American Refugees, their survival and resilience are recognized in California's history books because for Laotian Americans, this is one step in recognizing the Laotian American refugee experience in our schools which provides Southeast Asian American youth with the visibility, acknowledgment, and celebration they deserve but also enriches the education of all students by deepening their understanding around a subject that is historically overlooked.
For more than 20 years the Laotian American National Alliance (LANA) has been dedicated to advancing the social and economic well-being of the multi-ethnic Laotian Americans in the United States through civic engagement and public policy advocacy.
The Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
Sincerely,
Jonathan Vorasane jonathan@lana-usa.org Chairman of the Board Laotian American National Alliance www.lanausa.org
