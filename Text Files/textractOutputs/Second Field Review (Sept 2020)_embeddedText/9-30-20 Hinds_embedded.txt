Dear Instructional Quality Commission:
My recommendation is short and simple: Don't do it. Stop and reconsider. Go back to the beginning.
Whatever you may think you are accomplishing with this curriculum, whatever you may wish you were doing with it, whatever you may be telling yourselves and others that you are doing with this curriculum, it will accomplish something else entirely: Tribalization. Balkanization. Anger, resentment, strife. Vastly more harm than good.
Regards, John Hinds Fremont
