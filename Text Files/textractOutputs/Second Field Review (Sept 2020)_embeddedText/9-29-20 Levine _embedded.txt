From: Alicia Levine Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 2:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] re: ESMC CONCERNS. Stop Antisemitism!
Dear CDE: My name is Dr. Alicia Rufman- Levine and I live in Los Angeles.
I am Jewish and as such, I belong to the most persecuted minority group in the world for more than 2,000 years. Discrimination and destruction of my people has been rampant throughout different civilizations, including the "intellectually progressive elite" of Europe and the USA. Please, do not let this anti-Semitic tendency in schools and Academia continue.
CALL TO ACTION I urge you to understand the power and consequences in your decisions by 1. Removing all citations that include anti-Israel sentiment 2. Rewriting the chapter on Jewish Americans to reflect a more accurate and inclusive Jewish narrative, which includes a countless number of positive and long lasting contributions to American Society, Culture and Values, as well as throughout American History. 3. Ensure that any additions to the curriculum will remain free of discriminatory content, such as antisemitic rhetoric, including but not restricted to mentions of BDS. 4. Thank you.
Dr Alicia Rufman-Levine, PhD.
