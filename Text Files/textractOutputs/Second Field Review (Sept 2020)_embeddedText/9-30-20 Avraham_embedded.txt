As a dark skinned Jew Of Yemeni and morroccan descent, I am appalled by the new "curriculum" in which you intend to "educate" California's students about my similarity to Irish Americans.
Unfortunately our education system is being taken over by a philosophy that glosses over atrocities throughout the world and focuses on on holding America and Israel for grievances that are self inflicted and natural consequences.
Just because conservative states engage in misinformation to espouse a radical agenda doesn't mean California should.
Should this continue you can fully expect moderate Californians to disagree.
History should be factual without any whitewashing or activism based
