The whole curriculum is just "politically correct" indoctrination. It will in the end divide us as a nation rather than bring us together. The whole direction and focus of this effort is wrong and will in the end be counter productive. It seems to me that this whole Model Curriculum was put together by a group of people who had a strong agenda and were not representative of the diversity of viewpoint which exists in California. The group should be reconstituted and a far less radical view of diversity and ethnicity taught to our children.
