To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to support the calls by the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) for a more inclusive ethnic studies curriculum.
The ESMC must reflect the diversity of the Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. The ESMC June 2019 draft, Chapter 2, Sample Lesson 2, "Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community" offers a foundational overview of Pan-Asianism and the socio-political construction of Asian American and Pacific Islander identity. This lesson guides students through dispelling the model minority myth and provides resources for a discussion on the importance of disaggregating AAPI data. Sample Lesson 2 is absent from the current draft and needs to be restored in the final draft.
While we appreciate that the Pacific Islander lesson has been included in the current ESMC draft, and the IQC has committed to developing an Arab American lesson by the November meeting, APISBMA does not understand why the Cambodian American lesson was removed from the original draft and demands that the lesson be restored. Based on 2010 census data, some of the largest AAPI ethnic groups - Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Asian Indian should also be represented with lessons in the ESMC. For AAPI lessons, we implore that the California Department of Education (CDE) reach out to community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity prior to submission to the IQC in November.
The CDE's Instructional Guidance for K-12 Education in Chapter 3 of the ESMC states that an "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies course can be designed to be an introduction to the socio-political construction of Asian American and Pacific Islander identity in the United States...This course can explore a broad range of topics and events pertaining to the Asian American and Pacific Islander experiences, and examine their contributions to U.S. history."
APISBMA maintains that the "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and be aligned with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. Ethnic Studies affords us all the opportunity to be champions of racial justice in the classroom. We look forward to embracing and empowering the global citizens in California's youth. I have seen first hand in my own classroom how powerful it is when every student can see themselves reflected in the curriculum. Please address the concerns of the APISBMA.
Thank you, Jen Myhre
