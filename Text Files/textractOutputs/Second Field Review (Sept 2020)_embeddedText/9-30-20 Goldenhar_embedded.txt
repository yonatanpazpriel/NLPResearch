To Whom it May Concern,
I am the mother of a 12 year old & 14 year old. Please include in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, lesson plans on Jewish Americans, accurate definitions of antisemitism & lessons of antisemitism. I urge you to include this information. The Jewish community continues to have many expressions of hate in our neighborhoods and schools. An accurate education to our youth is imperative to help our community feel safe.
With respect, Rachel Goldenhar
