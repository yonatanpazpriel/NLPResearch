Antisemitism is sometimes considered the oldest form of hatred, and at this time hate crimes against Jews comprise the largest fraction of hate crimes. Thus, it is disheartening that while you have departed from your original mandate by including the Arab-American experience within the general heading of Asians, you have chosen to include nothing about Jews, regardless of origin, or antisemitism. At a time of heightened tension, this seems to be a serious omission. In addition, it seems as if derogatory material about Jews can still be included in the curriculum through biased discussions of the conflict in the middle east. Both these issues should be modified, or your curriculum will increase hate rather than increasing understanding.
