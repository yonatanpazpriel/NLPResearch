I am writing to urge you to include the history of Jews in California and the United States, including the history of antisemitism endured by the Jewish people. Although Jews comprise about 2% of the United States population, they were the victims of 58% of hate crimes on the basis of religion according to the FBUI 2017 Hate Crime Statistics. Moreover, antiSemitic incidents reached an all-time high in 2019 since tracking began in 1979, with more than 2100 acts of assault, vandalism and harassment according to the Anti-Defamation League, including 56% increase in assaults. Given these figures, it is simply unconscionable that Jews are absent from a curriculum that has the purpose of educating about diversity and combatting bias. As a teacher, I know the importance of knowledge in dispelling harmful misconceptions and beliefs. It is your duty to respond forcefully to the disturbing increase in antisemitism by teaching about the history and contributions of the Jewish people and about the ongoing discrimination that they encounter. Thank you for your consideration. Alicia Lieberman
