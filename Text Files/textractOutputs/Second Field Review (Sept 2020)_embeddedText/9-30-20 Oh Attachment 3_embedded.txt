 Lesson Purpose and Overview/thesis
:This lesson introduces students to the experiences of early Korean Americans. Koreans began to immigrate to the United States after the Treaty of 1882 but the significant wave began almost 20 years later as farm workers. After they arrived in the U.S., they faced challenges like other Asian immigrants, such as antiAsian laws, racism, language barriers, and harsh working conditions. In addition to domestic challenges, they also suffered from the tragedy that happened to their homeland: the colonization of Korea by Japan. As people who lost their country's autonomy and international status as an independent state, they were not able to enjoy the privileges from an official government representative in the U.S.
2

Many Korean Americans realized they had the opportunity to help their homeland become independent while living in the U.S.. While navigating all the challenges as immigrants from a colonized land, early Korean Americans actively participated in the Korean independence movement by providing political and financial aid. Eventually, they became the largest donors to the movement out of all of the Koreans communities in the world. During this difficult time, Korean independence activists became the leaders of the Korean American community and they became the official representatives of Korean Americans to the U.S. government instead of the Imperial Japanese government, which stemmed from the Hemet's Korean Incident in 1913.
During this lesson, students will take a close look into the birth of the Korean American community in the early 20th century. This lesson can be used as a stand-alone lesson or integrated into different units in ethnic studies, 10th grade modern world history, 11th grade modern U.S. history, or any other modern world/U.S. history classes. I also added the suggested prerequisite knowledge at the beginning of this lesson plan, though it is not mandatory. It is suggested in case you would like to integrate this lesson as a case study into those prerequisite topics. I also suggest using this lesson to compare and contrast immigrants' experiences in the early 20th century. It could also be used to further investigate the increasingly complex relationship between the U.S. and Japan after the Hemet's Korean Incident until World War II.
The Lesson Steps include only some of the graphic organizers that I provided. However, I recommend teachers use all the graphic organizers for students who are not trained to facilitate full verbal discussions, students who have different abilities (such as English Language Learners), and students who will benefit from additional visual/written organization.
 Lesson Steps
 Day 1: Push and Pull Factors of Korean Immigrants to the U.S  Essential Question: What were the push and pull factors of Korean immigrants in the early 20th century?  Students will discuss why people leave for a new area, how people decide where they live next.  Students will rewrite the essential question with their own words and ask them what they think today's learning target is.  Students will define what `push' and `pull' factors when it comes to immigration. Why do people leave their country? What country do they choose to move? What are some push and pull factors of immigration?  Teacher will distribute Source 1: Korean Population in the U.S. and Significant Domestic and International events between 1900 and 1920  Students will analyze Source 1  The Census table: Discuss what they noticed from the table focusing on changes of Korean population between Hawaii and Mainland U.S.  Chronology: Discuss what events might have had affected Korean immigration to the U.S.  Teacher will distribute Student Handout I: Korean Immigration Push and Pull factors in the early 20th Century , Source 2: Asian Americans Then and Now (Asian Society), Source 3: Korean's Immigration to the U.S: History and Contemporary Trends (2011, Pyong Gap Min), and Source 4: "Mrs. K.": Oral History of a Korean Picture Bride (1979, Alice Y. Chai).  Students will identify the push and pull factors of Korean immigration to the U.S. in the early 20th century and write them down in the Student Handout I.
3

 Students will choose the two most impactful pull and push factors and summarize why Koreans left Korea and moved to the U.S. in the early 20th century with one paragraph at the bottom of their graphic organizer.
 Day 2: Hemet's Korean Incident Part I  Essential Question: How did the early Korean Americans respond to the challenges they faced?  Students will discuss challenges that immigrants face based on their prior knowledge.  Students will rewrite the essential question with their own words and ask them what they think today's learning target is.  Distribute Source 1 from yesterday.  Students will revisit the historical context in the early 20th centuries in the U.S. and Korea and Korea's international status.  Japan colonized Korea.  Anti-immigrant and Asian sentiment in the U.S.  The rise of the U.S. as one of the superpowers in the world  Distribute Source 2-4 from yesterday.  Students identify some challenges that Korean immigrants faced from Source 1-4. They will write each challenge on each sticky note.  Distribute Source 5: California Law Prohibits Asian Immigrants from Owning Land [Modified].  Students will discuss how the Alien Land Law would affect Korean immigrants considering Korea's international status, Asian Americans' domestic status, and global events at the time of the event. Add more challenges on sticky notes.  By using the sticky notes, students will write a paragraph about the domestic and international challenges that Korean immigrants experienced in the early 20th century.
 Day 3: Hemet's Korean Incident Part II  Essential Question: How did the early Korean Americans respond to the challenges they faced?  Distribute Source 6: Hemet's Korean Incident (cut each source)  Students will sort the four sources into primary and secondary sources and then the sources chronologically.  Students will discuss the details of the events including; when and where the events took place, what the Korean fruit pickers experienced, how Japan responded to the event and their reasoning, who David Lee was and how his role changed after the event, how the early Korean-Americans saw Japan's occupation of Korea according to David Lee, what the Secretary Bryan's decision on the expelled Korean fruit pickers, which side Bryan's decision favored between Japan and the Koreans.  Students will share remaining questions on the event focusing on possible consequences of the event, such as how Brayan's decision would affect the relationship between the U.S. and Japan or Korean Americans' status in the U.S..  Students will write a paragraph about the significance of the Hemet's Korean Incident.
 Day 4-5. Korean Independence Movement in the U.S.  Essential Question: How did Korean independence activists in the U.S. help the establishment of the early Korean-American identity?  Students will rewrite the essential question with their own words and ask them what they think today's learning target is.  Students will discuss what "being independent" means and how important being independent is as a country.  Teacher will divide students into 6 groups; 7-1, 7-2, 8-1, 8-2, 9-1, 9-2  Teacher will give one source per group. (note to teachers: please see the Example of World Cafe poster/source, each group will receive different colors for their markers)
4

 Group 7-1 (green) and 7-2 (blue) will analyze Source 7: The First Korean Congress in the U.S.: An Appeal to America
 Group 8-1 (black) and 8-2 (red) will analyze Source 8: Republic of Korea Certificate of Indebtedness, No. 252, for $100, signed by Kuisic Kimm and Syngman Rhee
 Group 9-1 (pink) and 9-2 (purple) will analyze Source 9: Korean Americans' Financial Support for the Korean Independence Movement
 Each group will analyze their source and take notes on the poster. (note to teachers: depending on students' ability and training to analyze sources, you may provide the questions from the student handout)
 After analyzing their source, students will write remaining questions at the bottom of the poster. Students will decide who is going to be the `host' for the next group (no one should be appointed to be a host more than once). Each group will move to the next source (example: 7-1 will move to 8-1 and 9-2 will move to 7-2). The `host' will remain at the original group table.
 The `guest' students will have time to analyze the new source at the new table. While other students are analyzing the new source, the `host' will prepare for a summary for his/her/their guests. After analysis, the host will summarize what the previous group discussed and will ask his/her/their guests to share what they learned. The guests and host will try to answer the unsolved questions by using their markers and add remaining questions. Students will decide who is going to be the `host' for the next group and the previous host will join the original group. Each group will move to the next source. The `host' will remain at the table. Repeat one more time.
 All students will go back to their group. For the students who hosted, other group members will `teach' the former hosts.
 Students will discuss how each source can answer today's question; How did Korean independence activists in the U.S. help the establishment of the early Korean American identity?"
 Students will write a culminating essay to answer the essential question; How did Korean independence activists in the U.S. help the establishment of the early Korean American identity?"

*Source Note: U.S. Census data for the mainland from 1910-1950 seems to grossly undercount the Korean population as the census numbers do not reconcile with data from community sources and immigration records, The undercounting may have been due to the transient nature of many Korean immigrants' lives. Because official data are not reliable, many sources provide guesstimates that vary by 500 to 1,000 in any given year. The numbers provided here are the generally accepted range of population estimates provided in several sources: Shinhan Monbo December 13, 1917; Wayne Patterson, The First Generation Korean Immigrants in Hawaii, 1903-1973; Won-yong Kim, Jaemi Hanin Oshipnyun Sal and Richard S.

In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act--the only United States Iaw to prevent immigration and naturalization on the basis of race--which restricted Chinese immigration for the next sixty years. The "Chinese Must Go" movement was so strong that Chinese immigration to the United States declined from 39,500 in 1882 to only 10 in 1887. By 1885, following Chinese Exclusion Act, large numbers of young Japanese laborers, together with smaller numbers of Koreans and Indians, began arriving on the West Coast where they replaced the Chinese as cheap labor in building railroads, farming, and fishing. Growing antiJapanese legislation and violence soon followed. In 1907, Japanese immigration was restricted by a "Gentleman's Agreement" between the United States and Japan. Small numbers of Korean immigrants came to Hawaii and then the mainland United States following the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War and Japan's occupation of Korea. Serving as strike-breakers, railroad builders, and agricultural workers, Korean immigrants faced not only racist exclusion in the United States but Japanese colonization at home. Some Korean patriots also settled in the United States as political exiles and organized for Korean independence.

(2011, Pyong Gap Min)
(...) After the diplomatic relations between the United States and Korea were established in 1884, a small number of Koreans, mostly students and politicians, came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. But it was approximately 7,200 Koreans who came to Hawaii between January 1903 and July 1905 to work on sugar plantations in Hawaii that composed the first wave of Korean labor migrants. (...) Beginning in 1884, American Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries were active in converting Koreans to Christianity. About 40% of pioneer Korean immigrants were converts to Christianity, and they chose to come to Hawaii for religious freedom as well as for a better economic life (Choy 1979). (...) After its victory in the RussoJapanese War in 1905, Japan made Korea its protectorate, gaining a free hand in influencing the Korean government. In February 1906, the Japanese government advised that all Koreans abroad be placed under the jurisdiction of Japanese consulates. Koreans in Hawaii and the U.S. mainland organized protest rallies, passing a resolution condemning Japan's aggressive policy in Korea (Choy 1979: 143). In this way, Korean immigrants in the United States started the anti-Japanese movement even before the annexation of Korea by Japan. (...)

I was born in 1904. My parents were very poor. One year, a heavy rain came, a flood; the crops all washed down. Oh, it was a very hard time, you know. My place was a very small country village, only about 100 houses. People can't talk, can't walk around. Under the Japanese, no freedom. Not even free talking. A very hard time. My auntie told me that my cousin was living where picture brides come, Hawaii. Always I heard Hawaii stories, that time. I think when I grow up I like going to Hawaii. Hawaii's a free place, everybody living well. Hawaii had freedom, so if you like to talk, you can talk; you like work, you can work. I wanted to come, so I sent my picture.

Source 5: California Law Prohibits Asian Immigrants from Owning Land [Modified] (Image | Los Angeles Examiner)
On May 3, 1913, California enacted the Alien Land Law, barring Asian immigrants from owning land [specifically Japanese]. California tightened the law further in 1920 and 1923, barring the leasing of land and land ownership by American-born children of Asian immigrant parents or by corporations controlled by Asian immigrants. These laws were supported by the California press, as well as the Hollywood Association (the picture above is from a home in Hollywood), Japanese and Korean (later Asiatic) Exclusion League and the Anti-Jap Laundry League (both founded by labor unions). Combined, these groups claimed tens of thousands of members. Though especially active in California, animosity for Asian immigrants operated on the national level too. In May 1912, President Woodrow Wilson wrote to a California backer: "In the matter of Chinese and Japanese coolie immigration I stand for the national policy of exclusion (or restricted immigration)...We cannot make a homogeneous population out of people who do not blend with the Caucasian race...Oriental coolieism will give us another race problem to solve, and surely we have had our lesson."

Consuls Act At Once. Los Angeles, Cal., June 26. The Japanese organizations of southern California took immediate cognizance today of the incident at Hemet when 15 Asiatics were driven from the town.
