To: Instructional Quality Commission
I am writing to ask for meaningful inclusion of Jewish Americans in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
The removal of denigrating content from the initial draft and the addition of an acknowledgement that antisemitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians it must be truly inclusive, and that includes representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community. Limited references to the Holocaust in history classes will not suffice.
Jews are an ethnic group that has historically faced intense discrimination and genocide, and Jews remain targets of hatred today.
Additionally, Jewish Americans are diverse. Approximately 15 percent of Jews are people of color and people from the Middle East and North Africa. If the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is to be expansive in its inclusion of ethnic groups, then the Jewish American experience must be included.
That is why we are calling for:
1) The inclusion of a meaningful definition of antisemitism.
2) The addition of a sample lesson reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans.
Thank you, Karen Kalinsky
