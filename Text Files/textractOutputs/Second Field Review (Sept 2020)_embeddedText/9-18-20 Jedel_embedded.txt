From: Marc Jedel Sent: Friday, September 18, 2020 1:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Feedback for ESMC draft
To: Instructional Quality Commission
I ask that you please accept and adopt the following requests to the California draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
1. Include a meaningful definition of anti-semitism. For guidance, you could consult the US Holocaust Memorial Museum's Encyclopedia: https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/antisemitism
2. Avoid any derogatory language about Jews, Israelis, and Israel, with guardrails in place to keep such language out of the classroom in the future. Any curriculum for California students should have no place for any derogatory language about humans, from any background, race, gender, religion, physical handicap, or other factors.
3. Add a sample lesson to the curriculum that reflects the diversity of Jewish Americans, including Jewish Americans from the Middle East and North Africa and Jews of Color. My cousin has a child who is a Jew of color.
4. Commit to complete transparency when developing the curriculum. Open government is the best way to achieve the best results for all Californians.
Thanks, Marc
