From: Sagy Shnap Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 9:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] I demand transparency, excluding BDS and antisemitism from school
BDS organizations are trying to force the California Department of Education to put Antisemitism, BDS, and antizionism back into the curriculum.
I demand transparency and make sure that the CDE stands by its pledge of excluding BDS and antisemitism from school lessons!
Leave the hate out of our lives.
