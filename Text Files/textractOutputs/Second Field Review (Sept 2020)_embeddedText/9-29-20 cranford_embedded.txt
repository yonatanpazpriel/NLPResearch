From: Netanya Cranford Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 8:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment in ESMC
Hello, I fully support the implementation of an ESMC, but the second draft still needs improvement.
Please recognize the diversity of Jewish Americans. We are not only of European descent. My own children are Native Jewish Americans.
Please include Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent when teaching about Arab Americans.
Please teach antisemitism and ensure your definition of antisemitism is accurate by using the definition by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
And lastly, please ensure transparency and public comment in all phases of the development and adaptation of this important ESMC.
Sincerely, Netanya Cranford
