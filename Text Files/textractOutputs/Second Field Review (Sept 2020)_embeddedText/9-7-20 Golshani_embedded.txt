To whom it may concern,
AB331 is anti-Semitic and biased. The last we need to do now is encourage hatred and division.
As a CA resident and attorney, I am vehemently opposed to AB 331.
Please do the right thing and do not allow AB 331 to move forward in its current form.
Sincerely, Lisa Golshani
