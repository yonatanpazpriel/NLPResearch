From: Margaret Kallman Sent: Friday, September 25, 2020 5:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; Tony Thurmond Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment below on REVISED Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
The Revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum erases, stereotypes, discriminates against certain ethnic peoples in favor of other ethnic peoples.
It ignores the Diversity among white people in California whose Ethnicity is Irish, German, Russian, Australian, Scottish, Hungarian, French, Welsh, etc.
It ignores the Diversity among Jews in California whose ancestors were Syrian, Moroccan, Libyan, Ashkenazi, Sefardi, Yemeni, Mizrachi, Iranian, etc.
Please FIX the Curriculum to make it an educational experience for the children of California - all children, including the children of the groups focused on - deserve to learn about the beneficial contributions to California of the ignored peoples. Very sincerely, Margaret Kallman, a Californian for >40 years
