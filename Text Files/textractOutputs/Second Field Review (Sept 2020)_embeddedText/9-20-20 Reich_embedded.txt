I want to say I am in favor of many aspects of this curriculum, but as the father of two Jewish daughters, I believe they are put at a grave disadvantage.
There is almost ZERO mention of any Jewish heritage, culture, or contributions to society with the exception from one of the approved lesson plans (CP Introduction to Ethnic Studies Record ID: C94Q67):
Unit 6: Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American
"Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege."
My kids attend the synagogue white supremacist John Earnest shot and murdered people. A Hannukah menorah display in a nearby neighborhood was defaced last year. California ranked third in 2019 in anti-Semitic incidents with the most overall incidents in the United States since 1979.
But please, it's important my children write essays about how being Jewish has allowed them racial privilege. It's not enough that they should be scared of being Jewish, they should be ashamed of it as well.
