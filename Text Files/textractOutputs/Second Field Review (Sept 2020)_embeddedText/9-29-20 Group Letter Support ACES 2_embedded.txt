From: Carol Gao Sent: Monday, September 28, 2020 9:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies; IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Request a Genuine Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am supportive of Ethnic Studies courses for high schools. However, I have deep concern about the current Aug. 2020 draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I'd like to add my support for the following two requests for revisions:
+ Request Genuine Ethnic Studies Curriculum that Comply with California History-Social Studies Framework 2016, sent to you by Better Ethnic Studies: https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hMvPYBFWGIKG8iGf1dMHhkYNKpgir9p/view?usp=sharing (P DF) + the detailed revision requests recently sent to you by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CyXME2uQNrJSjTeSLeYnN_oChl7rYfdO/view (DOCX)
Thank you for your attention to these crucial problems in the ESMC. Sincerely,
Carol Gao Sunnyvale, California
