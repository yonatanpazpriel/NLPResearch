From: Allyn Charney Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 1:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Needs to Include Jewish Americans
To whom it may concern:
The new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum needs to address and expand to include the following missing subjects:
1. Lesson plan on Jewish Americans in all their diversity of origins, including but not exclusive to Jews of Color
2. An accurate definition of Anti-Semitism
3. Illustrations of Anti-Semitism including Anti-Israel Movements that include Anti-Semitic tropes and sentiments, Holocaust Denial, vandalism, outright violence, and the growth of Anti-Semitism in the US (Charlottesville, Tree of Life Synagogue, Chabad of Poway, etc.)
There needs to be transparency regarding the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which gives all affected by its adoption ample opportunity to publicly comment before the curriculum is adopted.
Thank you for your attention and consideration of these important subjects.
Sincerely, Allyn Charney (San Diego, CA)
