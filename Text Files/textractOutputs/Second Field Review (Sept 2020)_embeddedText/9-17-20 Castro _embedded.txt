Dear Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Committee,

Hope you are well!

I am writing to you as a citizen running for Alameda Unified School Board of Education. I intend to win and have momentum in doing so. Inclusion and diversity are part of my focus areas and will do all I can to support ethnic studies across our island.

As a Pacific Islander rooted in Chamorro culture I was invisible as a child growing up in the CA public school system and teaching over 27 years in the same system, my culture as well as my friends cultures were also non-existent. So, thank you for addressing and making notice of the rich cultures that make up Ca, the cultures are the fabric of our great country and the cultures that still exist in our schools. Our diverse numbers are increasing in Alameda County and in Ca in general, let's do this right to understand the roots and continuing impact of racism telling immigrant stories and a step in repairing the harm by providing acknowledgement to our students and their families.

Consider including the following AUSD students:

� bring back the 2 Pacific Island removed lessons to the K-12 curriculum

� Add the following cultures:

�

Jewish American and addressing antisemitism

�

Arab Americans

�

Korean Americans

�

Japanese Americans

Thank you for your consideration,
