From: bobman58 Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 10:56 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] New Curriculum
Dear IQC and SBE members:
As a concerned California resident and taxpayer, I am compelled to comment on the proposed new curriculum regarding the ethics studies course. This proposed unit, requiring students to write about events that have lead to "Jewish Privilege" in
America, is outrageous, offensive, racist and dangerous. It is rather ignorant to suggest that the Jewish people benefit from privilege or special treatment in this country, or abroad. One only need open the newspaper or click on an internet link to realize that
the Jewish people been persecuted their entire history, and anti-semitism is at an all time high in the United States and Europe. Jews are murdered just for being Jews. This is a privilege? I think not.
I strongly recommend doing your due diligence in researching the subject matter before spreading misinformation to our children. I believe that once you reevaluate your stance on this subject, you will rightly choose to eliminate this divisive, ignorant and hateful language and curriculum.
Thank you very much for your consideration, and I look forward to positive changes in our children's education. Feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have regarding this matter.
If you will it, it is no dream - T. Herzl
