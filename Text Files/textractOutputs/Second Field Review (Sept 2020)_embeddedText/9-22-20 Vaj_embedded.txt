From: Marcy Vaj Sent: Tuesday, September 22, 2020 6:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews in CA
There isn't enough education in CA or in the country, for that matter, about different cultures including the Jewish culture. Therefore, we get a high level of intolerance spread around by everyone regarding those who are different or "unknown". To begin to remedy this in regard to Jews, the policy of BDS should be discussed from all sides and its origin should be taught. It's definitely not born of love of thy neighbor. Thank you for your consideration, Marcy Vaj
