Dear Friends,
Even as an art teacher, I've heard students' comments about Jews, particularly when we've studied Renaissance painting and someone may say that Jesus was Jewish. There's always surprise and confusion. Didn't the Jews murder him, etc. There's a lot of history that needs to be taught.
However, I'm taking this opportunity to express my hope that the following may be included in the category of contemporary ethnic studies for California students. They should know that Jews are from different cultures and geographic locations, that there are Ashkenazi (mostly eastern Europe), Sephardic (originally Spanish) and Mizrachi north African and Arab) Jews, as well as black Jews (Ethiopian). They have very different diets and professions and interests. They may worship differently and/or not at all; there are many secular Jews.
As for a definition of antisemitism, the US State Department adopted one in 2010 that might be useful. I think it's also important to mention that although the Holocaust occurred 75 years ago, its reverberations are still felt within the community.
I encourage a transparent process of developing this curriculum and the opportunity for public comment.
Much thanks, Marion Nina Amber
