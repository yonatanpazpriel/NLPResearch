Dear Mr Thurmond
It is with great disappointment, anger, and frustration that we have to fight to bring the Japanese American experience back into the curriculum.
Since most of the Japanese Americans that were interned during WWII were from California, I find it hard to believe that the school curriculum would chose to leave out this part of American and Californian history.
Growing up in the 70's and 80's it was only a brief mention in the schoolbooks. Even as late as a few years ago, current political figures use the internment as a model to deal with racial issues...
This has got to stop and we need to have these topics discussed in our schools.
Racial discrimination is not just a black issue, it affects many ethnicities and cultures...
