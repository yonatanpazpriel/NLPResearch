I am concerned that after being pressured by organizations trying to restore BDS and antisemitism to the curriculum, the CDE has added a chapter that is not open to review. I welcome an Arab-American lesson, but not one guided by the hand of BDS radicals and hidden from the public. The protocol of allowing the public to review the curriculum and comment on it allows constituents to hold the CDE to its commitment against discrimination, as promised when revising the first draft. I ask that the CDE stand by its previous pledge to keep antisemitism and BDS out of the curriculum, and to open the additional sample chapter up to fair and transparent review prior to the closing of the comment period on September 30th.
