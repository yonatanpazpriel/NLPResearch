Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
AdvancED Consulting, LLC is pleased to support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on:
 Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community
 Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At a minimum, i nclude additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
As the owner of management and Salesforce consultancy AdvancED Consulting, LLC, I have supported nonprofit and education organizations and community leaders across California since 2011. I am also the Founding Operations Director of the California College Guidance Initiative, a virtual statewide organization that uses www.CaliforniaColleges.edu to support 15% of California's 6th-12th grade students in developing informed, thoughtful postsecondary plans in collaboration with schools, districts, postsecondary institutions, and community organizations. I have spent the last three years researching and writing content specific to supporting underserved populations like California's BIPOC youth in accessing the support they need to not just survive in this state, but to thrive. Today, I serve multiple nonprofits in supporting youth through effective K-12 support, college access and financial aid coaching programs, tools, and services. As the Chairperson for the Commission on the Status of Women serving Santa Clara County, I am especially attentive to the needs of BIPOC youth in this county and the need to support them comprehensively and holistically. Ensuring their access to lesson plans that meet the needs of specific

populations like Cambodian Americans, Asian Americans, and Pacific Islanders is critical to their understanding of their histories and developmental growth. The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
