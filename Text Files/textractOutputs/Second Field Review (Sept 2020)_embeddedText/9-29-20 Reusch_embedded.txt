From: Will Reusch Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 7:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies; IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
I am William Reusch, a HS teacher in Los Angeles. This is a Trojan Horse of bad ideas- I deeply understand Ethnic Studies and have taught it properly for years. These standards are divisive and dangerous. Please reconsider. Do research. Our children matter. Contact me any time.
