Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
As a California state resident and mother, I would like my voice heard regarding the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum:
1. Any lesson plan on ethnic groups in California should include Jewish Americans, and recognize the diversity of Jews in national origin and background as we might discuss for say Asian Americans.
2. Ensure any Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum lesson plan includes anti-semitism as a historical and current example of bigotry; and include an accurate definition of anti-semitism, which reflects the depth and breadth of hate against Jews in more subtle forms including the de-legitimization of Israel and denial of the Holocaust. The ADL includes resources for lesson plans on anti-semitism here: https://antisemitism.adl.org/
3. Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. How can you create a curriculum on our ethnic groups without providing them a voice in its development?
