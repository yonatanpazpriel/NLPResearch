To those determining the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum,
I am concerned about the recently released second draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) in July 2020. Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) ignored the protocols meant to guarantee public transparency. At the 11th hour, IQC announced it would reinsert an unspecified lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum.
Unfortunately, the antisemitic and anti-Israel bias in the 2019 draft was found in a lesson plan on Arab Americans. Transparency is needed. As a follow-up to the IQC request for public comment on this second draft, I am expressing my support for:
� A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color.
� A lesson plan on Arab Americans that will also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
� An accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
� Inclusion of lessons about antisemitism. � Transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the
development of a final ESMC
As a concerned California resident, I hope that the IQC will do what's right for all Californians in our rich and wonderful diversity.
Sincerely, Beth Elster
