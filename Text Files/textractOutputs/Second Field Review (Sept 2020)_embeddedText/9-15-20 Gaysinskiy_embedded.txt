Hi, my name is Sonya and I'm a college student and Jewish. My mom and cousin have been actively posting on social media about how the new proposed curriculum does not appropriately discuss the Jewish narrative and american anti-semitism. I haven't found a direct source outlining what specifically will be taught in this new curriculum. Do you have anything you can point me to?
I think it's great that california is making a change to the K-12 history curriculum. I always found it to be anglo-american and short of the times especially as I've continued onto higher education learning more about the world. I understand that many members of my Jewish community are still carrying trauma from past generations. I know that it's important that we are included in the California ethnic studies curriculum so our neighbors better understand what we've gone through especially in the last 50 years. I also know it's important we change our bias about Israel and Palestine and start learning more about the political relationships in the middle east as there is still so many misconceptions about both peoples. It's also important that we begin to understand that native americans aren't just a group of people who lived here a long time ago, they are still fighting to save their culture.
I'm excited for my sister to go to a school where she learns about different cultures and know what a "third world" country actually means. But I don't want her cultures to be earased from her education. She went to a Jewish school for years learning about her culture and I don't want her to loose the opportunity to discuss it with her peers in class.
Thank you for your time. - Sonya
