From: William Brenner Sent: Friday, September 11, 2020 6:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish privilege and anti-Israel Jew Hatred by another name) Language in the Revised Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
No other ethnic group has suffered the more than 30% losses as did the Jews during the Nazi Holocaust of the Jewish peoples of Europe during the Second World War. For California, a state which has benefited from the contributions of its Jewish citizens from clothing (Levis jeans) to Hollywood ( an entire industry) to science (atomic energy) to Medicine (the Salk Institute and the Swan Ganz heart catheter), to impugn the Jewish people with terms such as "Jewish privilege" as reported in the LA Times, and attacks on the Sate of Israel, the only true democracy in the Mid-East, and the most reliable strategic ally of the United States, is an atrocious insult to the Jewish citizens of California and would serve to further divide future generations of Californians by race and by ethnicity. Revisions are not in order. Abandonment of this entire project is the right thing to do. The best laid plans of mice and men aft gang agleigh. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Respectfully and Sincerely Submitted, William I. Brenner MD, FACS, Clinical Professor of Cardiac Surgery, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.
