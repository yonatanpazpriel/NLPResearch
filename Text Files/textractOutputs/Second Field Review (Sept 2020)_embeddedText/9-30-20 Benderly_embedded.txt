Dear staff, I think it is important to have an ethnic class to educate students about people's history and heritage. With regards to the Jewish people, the following are my concerns. 1. I would want to see an accurate description of anti - semitism and lesson plans around this topic. My children are daily harassed with anti Semitic statements at school and on line. The situation is worsening and alarming. 2. Transparency and the ability to comment throughout the process of developing the curriculum. 3. A lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognized the diversity of the community - including Ashkenazi, Sephardic , and Jews of color. 4. A lesson plan on Arab Americans should include Jewish Americans from North Africa and middle eastern countries.
Thank you, Rakefet Benderly
