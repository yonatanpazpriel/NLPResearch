As a mother of 3, an American, born in Israel, however I was raised in part in Southern parts of Africa, including SA and a place formally called Rhodesia, amongst other countries in Africa. I watched what a true apartheid looked like. Labelling Israel thus, without including the full perspectives will create more animosity! Including all matters of BDS, with foster a need to defend, rather than educate example: The Peel Commission Plan (1937) Parents like myself, unable to vet the ideology or perspective revealed at the school level K-12, leaves much open for indoctrination. So without the narrative of all other minorities, it will be harmful to all. We do not want to get rid of the Arab voices, we do not want to get rid of their truth. We only ask to include the voices of all Jews and other minorities, in the middle east. BUT more importantly, I truly belief if not vetted correctly, the Ethnic Studies Curriculum marginalising each groups representation, pitting and putting students/people of all colors into categories. We can argue that white men are oppressors and that people need this curriculum to divide and Conquer... just food for thought and maybe time for Education not indoctrination.
