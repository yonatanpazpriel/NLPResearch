Hi,
I have a child who is a student at CMS, Cupertino, California. He will be in High School next year and I was excited about the new subject Ethnic studies and was hoping that it would be implemented fast enough so he could benefit.
However, my attention was drawn to the fact that the category of Jews is not well represented in this text book. Antisemitism is a big danger in nowadays America, present daily and everywhere even in schools and universities. Without the proper education it won't disappear by itself, quite the opposite, it'll be worse. Please take action and give importance to this subject.
Antisemitism is racist hate and it needs to be treated as seriously as you treat hate against other ethnicities or races.This subject deserves to be discussed and explained in a chapter of this text book that takes the challenge of educating for better the next generation.
Thank you, Stela Iacob
