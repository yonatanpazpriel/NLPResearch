From: Stephen Levinson Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 5:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies mandate
I am writing to suggest that you eliminate consideration of imposing an ethnic studies mandate. Such a mandate will undoubtedly treat specific ethnic groups as either victims or as oppressors and will, in my opinion be excessively polarizing. Also, I have seen no well conducted studies that demonstrates improved outcomes from imposition of such a mandate. Also, the inclusion of 4 ethnicities to study and the failure to include anti-Semitism into the curriculum is a glaring omission and an illustration of how poorly conceived that this program is.
