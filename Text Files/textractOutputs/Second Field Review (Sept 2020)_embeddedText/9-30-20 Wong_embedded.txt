To Whom It May Concern:
As the former Executive Director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation, I have spent years dedicated to educating the public about the shameful discrimination faced by Asian immigrants include Chinese, Japanese, South Asians, Filipinos, and Koreans who attempted to immigrate to the U.S. in the late 1880s to 1940s. History allows our contemporary society to learn from mistakes of the past.
Thus, it would be shameful if Japanese American history were not included in the ethnic studies curriculum in California schools. One only needs to cite the critical role Japanese Americans played in the agricultural development of California to make the case for inclusion in our state's curriculum.
Similarly, the uprooting of Japanese American communities due to wartime hysteria in 1942 resulted in tremendous hardships and stained American principles of justice and equality. Surely, we must learn from these travesties.
Sincerely,
Edward Wong Oakland, CA
