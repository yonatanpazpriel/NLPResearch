To whom it may concern:
In my opinion, the Ethnic Study Model Curriculum (ESMC) should undergo a fundamental revision for the following major reasons:
!. It is shocking to realize that the draft completely omits the oldest most virulent bigotry in the world, i.e., anti-Semitism. Not even mentioning Holocaust in a document entire dedicated to all kinds of persecutions and oppressions, suffered by minorities, is beyond comprehension. The fact that millions of people died just because of their origin should serve as a lesson, especially for our children, where hate can lead. And most of the California Jews are descendants of the Holocaust survivors.
2. The current draft is telling just a half-truth of the California's history. The draft enumerates the injustice committed toward minorities, mostly in the past, with an implication that nothing has changed, in the present. But hundreds of thousands from these minorities successfully participated in building the mighty California economy, the sixth largest in the world. Sounds that for the ESMC authors success and privilege are synonymous and equally distasteful.
California teachers deserve a truly objective and factual, not a biased and revolution-driven, ethnic study guidance.
