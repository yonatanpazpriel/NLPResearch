From: Alisi Tulua Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 11:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for Pacific Islander and Arab American
Hello,
My name is 'Alisi Tulua, and I am a program manager with the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander Community Alliance (OCAPICA) and a long-time Pacific Islander community advocate. I am writing to amplify the asks of Pacific Islander and Arab American communities in calling for the following actions moving forward with the ESMC and its process. I deeply urge the commission to:
� Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, honoring and including the expertise of the original committee of writers AND Pacific Island Studies experts
� Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism--and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
� Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hauofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam
What you decide for this curriculum will have lifelong impact on all future generations of Pacific Islanders in California. In turn, it will strengthen school communities, local communities where Pacific Islanders live, and contribute to a thriving state. This is the future that an inclusive and critical curriculum will help to build. In the same breath, my sentiments here also apply to the inclusion of Arab studies curriculum. I hope that you consider the implications of a fully inclusive education on the future of our communities and the state.
Thank you for your work and thoughtfulness on this matter,

"We should not be defined by the smallness of our islands, but by the greatness of our oceans. We must wake up to this ancient truth and, together, use it to overturn all hegemonic views that aim, ultimately, to confine us again; physically and
psychologically. It is time to create things for ourselves; to create established standards of excellence that match those of our ancestors'."
Dr. `Epeli Hau'ofa
