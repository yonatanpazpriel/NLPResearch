Dear Instructional Quality Commission and the California Department of Education:
AB 331 � High school course requirement in Ethnic Studies:
I want a lesson plan on Jewish Americans with inclusion of a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry.
I want a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent.
I want an accurate definition of antisemitism, such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
I want an inclusion of lessons about antisemitism.
I want transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
