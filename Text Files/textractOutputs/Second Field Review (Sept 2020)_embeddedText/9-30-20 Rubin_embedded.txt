From: Rob Rubin Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 9:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Draft
I think it is great that the ESMC is being created. However, objective analysis shows that the anti-Semitic lesson plan dropped in the first draft has made its way back into the current draft. Please: 1) Remove the bias 2) Include an accurate definition of anti-Sementicism 3) Inclusion of lessons on anti-Sementicism.
Thank you,
