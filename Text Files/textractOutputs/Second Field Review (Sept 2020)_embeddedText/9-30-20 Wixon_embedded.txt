I am completely opposed to this being in today's classrooms. It is forwarding an agenda of Critical Race Theory, which is a philosophy which implodes on itself. You need look no further than Ibram Kendi's latest remarks (see below) regarding the Supreme Court nominee or the open letter to the UC Berkley History Department - . https://californiaglobe.com/section-2/uc-berkeley-history-professors-open-letter-against-blm-police-brutality-andcultural-orthodoxy/ - which is fascism and racism itself in their response. And you want to bring this into the education systems for all children today? The money and effort would be much better used understanding current constitutional and civil rights history (actual history, not the 1619 Project) and compare them with other countries. All this does is create more oppressed and oppressor groups, but now children get to learn this garbage at a very young age, and if they are white children they will have nothing to say if they disagree with it. By the way, why would a white child need to learn this if they have nothing to say about it later?
We can also know the USA does have a culture that is superior in many ways to other countries. Consider how we allow someone like Ibram Kendi, a US citizen as immigrants from Haiti, to become a professor (what a great story!). What would his opportunities have been in Haiti? We allow the academics to criticize the entirety of western civilization. How would that have worked in the USSR or in modern China? Maybe you would prefer a witch doctor to heal your burst appendix or your heart attack, because that would be on the same cultural equivalency as an actual medical doctor removing a burst appendix or performing CPR according to CRT. This curriculum is a horrible and illadvised way to educate children and you should be ashamed, yes ashamed, if you pursue this trite, politically correct nonsense. Spend the time and effort on simple civics and learning of the history of our constitution.
By the way, the CRT philosophy implodes on itself � if you choose to use the same non-sensical logic this theory presents, I am now identifying as a black female (even though I am clearly a caucasian male) � my identified voice should now have higher standing in my opposition to this false reality. So please, now that I have a higher standing be sure that my voice is heard at a higher level and counts for more than other white oppressors. It is a false reality that requires one literally to suspend logic, reason and reality to make sense (in most circles this would be considered fantasy or fiction).
Sincerely,
