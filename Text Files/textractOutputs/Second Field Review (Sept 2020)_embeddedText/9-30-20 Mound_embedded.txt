I am a former secondary school teacher in the states of Indiana and California. I note that you have reinserted wording in the lesson plan on Arab Americans within the Asian American curriculum. I strongly object to the antisemitic and antiIsrael bias in the lesson plan.
California is a leader in the United States and the world. We must, therefore, be diligent in making sure that a comprehensive definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry is included and explained thoroughly. Because of the important role California plays, we must do the right thing regarding this topic.
Thank you for your immediate attention to this important concept which will make a huge and positive difference in the attitudes and beliefs of thousands of high school students.
