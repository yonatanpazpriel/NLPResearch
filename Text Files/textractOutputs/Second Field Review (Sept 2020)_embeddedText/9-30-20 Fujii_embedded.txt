To: Tony Thurmond From: Paul Fujii
I'm impressing upon you to provide the Asian American Pacicific Islander Unit in Ethnic Studies cirriculum. The rich diversity of the Asian American Pan Pacific Islander community is so important. The untold discussion of the incarceration during World War II and injustice, violation of human and civil liberties, injustice and accomplishments must be heard and told. The events then are so current today. To many the story is still not known and should be discussed. I urge you to provide one of the most untold and important history in your curriculum.
