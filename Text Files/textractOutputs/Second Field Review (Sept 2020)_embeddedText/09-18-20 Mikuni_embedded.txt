Hello and thank you for the opportunity to comment. Overall, I think this curriculum is excellent and I believe what would make it even better would be to include a lesson plan on Jewish Americans that recognizes the diversity of the community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent. As a member of a minority group myself (Asian) having been born and raised in Hawaii where we don't have many residents of Jewish or Arab descent, this is very important for me and others like me to learn more about.
Thank you for your time in considering this request.
Sincerely, Allison Mikuni Honolulu, Hawaii
