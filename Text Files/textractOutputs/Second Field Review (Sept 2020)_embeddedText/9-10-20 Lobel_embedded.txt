In the 1930s my father was denied admission to the University of Pennsylvania because they had already "filled their Jewish quota." It took three years for him to start pre-med. In my lifetime there have been violent anti-Semitic graffiti posted everywhere, Synagog bombings, and mass murders. Perhaps you should reconsider your definition of privileged.
