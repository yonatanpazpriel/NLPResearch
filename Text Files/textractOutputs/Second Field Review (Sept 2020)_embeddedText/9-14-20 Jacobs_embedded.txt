Dear IQC, BOE President Darling-Hammond, Superintendent Thurmond, and Governor Newsom,
I can't believe we're in this place, one year after Governor Newsom said the curriculum "would never see the light of day".
I hope you can enact the items detailed by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies. Ethnic Studies should be a multicultural celebration, not agenda-based hatred.
Thank you for your consideration, Suzanne Jacobs
