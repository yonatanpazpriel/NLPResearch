Dear CA Dept. of Education,
I have recently become aware of antisemitism in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum recently mandated for all CA high school students.
I am quoting here what the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has said regarding this issue...
"We suggest that the ESMC recognize that the American Jewish community includes people of color and that many Jewish Americans trace their family roots to the Middle East and North Africa. For example, we draw your attention to a suggested lesson plan entitled "Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American."2 The title and description give the impression that American Jews are uniformly of European descent and as such have all attained "white identity" and "racial privilege," to quote the lesson plan. It is an ironic conclusion as white supremacists explicitly reject the "whiteness" of any Jew. Indeed, their hate-filled worldview sees Jews as a critical player in the destruction of the "white race." Failing to acknowledge the ethnic diversity of the Jewish community will mislead students about the complexity of contemporary Jewish identity and the hatred targeting Jews".
Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to help resolve this issue.
Best regards, Stephanie Allen La Jolla High School Parent
