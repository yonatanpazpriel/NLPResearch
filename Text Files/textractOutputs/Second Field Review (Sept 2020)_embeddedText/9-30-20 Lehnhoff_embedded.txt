Hello,
I am very concerned to have read the curriculum that was posted for California schools. Specifically teaching about Jewish privilege. Considering in 2017 in Charlottesville, VA Neo-Nazis were marching in the street screaming `Jews will not replace us'.
Since 2016 Anti Semitic attacks in this country and around the world have increased. By saying that Jewish people have privilege is ignoring the fact that most of us fear being recognized as a Jew walking the streets in The United States of America.
Jewish people have been the target of hate and lies since the beginning of our religion and it led to the Holocaust.
The Holocaust was a genocide that murdered about 11,000,000 people labeled as `undesirables' by the Nazis in World War Two. The most affected group were the Jews that lost 6,000,000 people.
I am a grandchild of Holocaust survivors. I have no extended family because my grandparents were the only ones to survive from their families. They came to this country hoping that their children and grandchildren would be safe. For the first time since my grandparents have passed away I am happy they are gone only so they do not have to witness the institutionalization of Anti-Semitic ideology happening again.
I implore you to please re-evaluate your stance on what you will be teaching the future generations about marginalized people. It may very well save my life.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
Marcie Lehnhoff
