Please VETO AB 331 and call on state lawmakers to establish legislation in the CA Education Code to ensure that state-approved instructional materials are free from partisan or political bias, and that teachers are prohibited from using their classrooms for the purpose of one-sided partisan advocacy or activism.
AB 331 is misguided and dangerous. It requires all CA high school students to take an ethnic studies course based on an AB 2016-mandated model curriculum, which has not yet been finalized, but from all indications will promote virulent antisemitism, erasure of significant swaths of Jewish history and experiences, and lead to harm against Jewish students in California classrooms, at a time when antisemitic hate crimes are by the leading and fastest growing form of hate-crimes in the USA, particularly on a per capita basis. Please VETO AB 331 and call for safeguards against political indoctrination and against increasing Jew-hatred in K-12.
