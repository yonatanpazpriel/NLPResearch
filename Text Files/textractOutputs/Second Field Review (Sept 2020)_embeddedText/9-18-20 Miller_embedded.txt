In a course on diversity and with an eye to ending discrimination against groups, how can you not include a section on Jewish Americans? That is incomprehensible! There should be a lesson plan on Jewish Americans and the diversity of that community including Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Any lesson plan on Arab Americans should refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent.
You should include an accurate definition of antisemitism. One is readily available in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's. It is noteworthy that the US State Department adopted that definition in 2010
There should be lessons about antisemitism.
And lesson plans should not be added without the opportunity for public comment. That is what is referred to as public transparency.
Thank you for your consideration.
