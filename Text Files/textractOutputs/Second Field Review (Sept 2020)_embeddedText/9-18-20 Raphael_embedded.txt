Jews are a minority and even if we have been long time members of the Californian state and are popularly thought of as successful, still are hit with sizable amount of prejudice and misunderstandings. If you are going to include other minorities, then Jews must be included such as Ashkenazi, Sephardic, Mizrachi Jews and Jews of color. Additionally, a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) descent. Attacks on Jews are at a high not seen since World War II, both here and internationally. Here in California we had the attack on the Poway Synagogue as well as other attacks. Both my sons have reported antisemitic incidents from schools. This needs to include an accurate definition of antisemitism such as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's, which the U.S. State Department adopted in 2010.
It doesn't have to be either or in terms of Arabs and Jews. Both have value; both should be included in such an Ethnic Studies curriculum.
