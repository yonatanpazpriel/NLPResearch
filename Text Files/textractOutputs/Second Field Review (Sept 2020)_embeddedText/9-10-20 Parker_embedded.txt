From the power point presentation of the class in Law and Education that I took at SFSU two years ago. "Hazelwood and California: Administrators may censor language that is libelous and speech that incites students to create a clear and present danger, THE COMMISSION OF UNLAWFUL ACTS...or demeans any race, religion, sex or ethnic group." I capitalized "the commission of unlawful acts" because this is the one thing in this list about which there can be no dispute. Leila Khaled is famous for her commission of unlawful acts, and she proudly admits that she did this. It is the reason she is an "icon" of the Palestinian resistance. She was involved in at least two "peaceful" airline hijackings. In a recent interview she explains that she had to do these hijackings to bring attention to the Palestinian cause, and makes the point that none of the Hijacked (kidnapped) passengers was killed or injured. However, in the September 6, 1970 Hijacking of an EL AL Boeing 707 she and her partner were carrying guns and grenades. 30 minutes into the flight they pulled out their guns and demanded that the destination be changed. She and her partner, Patrick Arguello, were thrown off balance by the nose dive the pilot engineered, and Arguello fired 3-5 shots one of which hit one of the stewards. Arguello threw his grenade down the aisle, but it failed to explode. Khaled reached for the grenades hidden in her bra, but failed to extract them. That they failed to blow up the plane is one of God's miracles. In the interview Khaled makes clear that she has no regrets about what she did, and further defends the indoctrination of Palestinian children to commit violent acts including her own two sons. This sounds like the commission and inciting of unlawful acts to me, and the idea that Dr. Abdulhadi is presenting an alternative point of view is laughable. She proudly proclaims that she reveres Leila Khaled, and that she agrees with her tactics 100 percent. The history of Rabab Abdulhadi's anti-Semitic teaching and writing is long and ugly, and the CSU is fully aware of this and rather than condemning her they promote her antisemitism. The articles listed here go back to 2004. Some interesting ones on a related topic are about the strong relationship between Portland State University in Oregon and Qatar, and that many prominent Qataris have studied at this University which is very welcoming to students from the Gulf.
