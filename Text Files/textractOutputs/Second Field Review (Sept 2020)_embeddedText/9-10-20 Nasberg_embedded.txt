Hi, My name is Dovid Nasberg and I am a Jewish American citizen.
I am horrified, disturbed and disgusted by your curriculum about the Jews leaving in the USA and how you portray the Israeli/Palestinian conflict as one sided presenting the Jewish as the oppressors and the palestinians as the victims, AND THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH AT ALL!!!
I have three kids (6,4,2) that I will need to send to school, how can I feel comfortable, how can I feel that the public school is a safe place for my kids if you are teaching curriculum that will encourage antisemitism and violence against Jews, as if qe didn't suffer enough...
You must get a Jewish Orthodox Rabbi to go over your curriculum and give his approval.
