Dear Supt. Thurmond,
Thank you for all you are doing for education in California and for the time you are taking to hear from local school districts regarding the draft Ethnic Studies curriculum. While this second draft appears better than the first, there's still room for concern and improvement.
I am a veteran trustee with the Mountain View Los Altos Union High School District (6 yrs with MVLA and another 8 yrs with our partner district MVWSD) and will be part of the team tasked with implementing an Ethnic Studies curriculum in our district. It is through this lens that I provide the brief comments below regarding the current draft curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration, Fiona Walter MVLA UHSD Board Vice President
� Please include/incorporate the changes recommended by APISBMA regarding the inclusion of Asian American subgroups found here: https://apisbma.org/ethnicstudies. These are strong, reasonable suggestions that I fully support.
� Please also go beyond the "flexibility to add to the curriculum" and instead mandate modules on API, Jews, Middle-Easterners, and the many other representative groups we have in our schools and nation. If this is to be a one year mandatory course for graduation, we have plenty of time to go beyond the four currently mandated topics. I fear that without a more comprehensive required list, California students will only receive the bare minimum and miss out on an enormous opportunity to better understand the broader world. We must educate global citizens and limiting this curriculum will not serve us well in this goal.
