The draft is so blatantly one sided and biased in its narrative that it takes my breath away. You do a great injustice and a disservice to your Jewish and Asian communities. Please stop bowing to the groups who have but one agenda, to divide California and Marginalize those who disagree with their narrow minded views!
Thank you, Lana I.
