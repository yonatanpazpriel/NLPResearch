From: a.b.sherman Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 9:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
Dear members of the committee,
As I'm sure you're aware, the Ethnic studies curriculum that was proposed and revised- is still an issue of concern to many. We Urge you to REMOVE ALL POLITICAL CONTENT from the final draft, and all BDS agenda (an organization which promotes hate). Additionally, we believe that a lesson plan on Arab Americans should also refer to Jewish Americans of Middle Eastern and North African descent. Finally, we ask for transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of the final draft.
Respectfully,
Anat Sherman San Diego, 92130
