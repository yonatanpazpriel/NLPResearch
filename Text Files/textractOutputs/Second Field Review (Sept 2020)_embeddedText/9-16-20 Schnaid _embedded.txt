From: Charles Schnaid Sent: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 4:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Changes to the ESMC
I am adding my STRONG request for you to adhere to the changes requested. With the Black Lives Matter movement , protests , defunding of our police and looting don`t you think the Jews who suffered 6 million lives during the Holocaust deserve respect and consideration for the ONLY Jewish State in the world , Israel , should be entitled to equal treatment? After all , the Jewish population of California has been at the forefront of California`s development from an economic , intellectual and innovative help in making CALIFORNIA successful. STOP this anti semitic influence on our children!
