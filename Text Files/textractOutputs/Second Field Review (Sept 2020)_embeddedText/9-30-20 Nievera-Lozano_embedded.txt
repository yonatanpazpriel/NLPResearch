Dear good people in the IQC (Instructional Quality Committee): As a Filipina who has taught 3 semesters of an "Intro to Pacific Islander History & Culture" course at De Anza College, and years of Filipino American and Asian American Studies across multiple institutions throughout the Bay Area, I testify that our ignorance of Pacific Islander realities is heartbreaking to witness.
Within the Filipinx community, Pacific Islander culture is often appropriated for so many conflicting reasons: our confusion with America's racial ladder, our experiences of being rejected or denied in East Asian spaces, and our shared colonial history with islands throughout Polynesia & Micronesia.
Our ongoing ignorance tells us it's imperative we learn better by including Pacific Islander scholarship & curriculum in Ethnic Studies, particularly to help stop the harm we -Filipina/x/os -- cause in our diverse communities. In our efforts to always be in right relationship within one another, we need Pacific Islander scholars and educators to be a light. We need Pacific Islander Studies now and for future generations to restore what has been lost.
Please listen to the people,
