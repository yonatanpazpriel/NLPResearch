Dear members of the IQC and SBE,
I have been informed of the curriculum being considered for inclusion in educating our children in the State of California as part of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). As the parent of two high-school aged, Jewish daughters currently enrolled in public education in our state, I have a close relationship with what is being taught in our schools. My children provide a lens into both what they receive directly from instructional material as well as how others receiving this instruction, receive it and form their own opinions. Being Jewish adds an additional sense of awareness to the educational environment, seemingly heightened in the current state of rising Nationalism around the United States. Now more than ever, a clear, well constructed statement about ethnic history and diversity in our country is needed. While I can't speak to the accuracy of the other ethnicities being represented in this curriculum, I have reviewed the mentions of Judaism as well as the attached letter from the AntiDefamation League. I feel the comments from the ADL are fair and provide language that is appropriate to be taught in a public education setting. Please consider using it in your final curriculum submittal and thank you for the thoughtful program you are aspiring to add to our future generation's understanding of the cultural mosaic that makes America great.
Sincerely,
Steve Shupper [address redacted] San Diego, CA
