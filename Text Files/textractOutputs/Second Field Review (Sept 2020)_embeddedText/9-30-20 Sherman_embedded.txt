From: Craig Sherman Sent: Tuesday, September 29, 2020 11:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] scrap the recent Inaccurate and Anti-Jewish insertion re Arab-Americans
The latest version submitted in August has a reinserted and inaccurate and biased flawed view and is incomplete and will not serve our state and developing young adults very well.
There is enough misperception and hatred that this needs to be done carefully and correctly.
Please re-vamp and re-study and fix this current mistake and do not further or approve this matter until is it is done.
Thank you.
-Craig
