Hi,
I am pleased to see that California is taking the bold move of developing an ethnic studies course, which will hopefully lead the way for the rest of the United States, and indeed the world, to follow in its footsteps. California has once again taken the initiative as a trailblazer on a contemporary issue with a constructive and productive attitude.
As someone who attended school in California for 8 years, I can attest to the robust and well prepared curriculum and school system already in place. I am sure this is yet another gem in the making.
Reading through the curriculum, I felt that a large amount of the course was vital and necessary information, and was shocked that some of this isn't already taught. There were one or two items which were disturbing, and I appreciate you giving us the opportunity to submit feedback. I trust you will take this into consideration.
1) I was very disturbed to see the course titled
"Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American"
Particularly, the following: "Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege"
It goes without saying that stereotyping an ethnic, cultural, and religious group (Jews) as privileged can be quite harmful, particularly a group that has suffered a large amount of recent persecution, even in America.
2) I was also disturbed to see the frequent and positive references to Nation of Islam and particularly Mr. Farrakhan as a role model, when the organization is a known hate group that openly promotes overt anti-Semitism.
Thank you for taking the time to invite and respond to feedback. I wish you much success in the implementation of this curriculum.
