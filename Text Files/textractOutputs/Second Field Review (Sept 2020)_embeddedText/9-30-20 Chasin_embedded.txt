Hello,
I am writing to provide input on the Ethnic studies model curriculum. I would like the curriculum to provide a lesson plan on Jewish Americans. The rate of hate crimes against Jews has risen dramatically in the last few years. This curriculum is a good opportunity to address this issue. The curriculum should also include an accurate definition of antisemitism as the US State Department did in 2010. There also should be lessons addressing antisemitism. Finally the curriculum adoption process need to be transparent and free from last minute changes that aren't publicly disclosed.
Thank you for your consideration,
Mike Chasin
