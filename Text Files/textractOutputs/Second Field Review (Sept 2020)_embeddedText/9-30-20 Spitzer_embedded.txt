From: Spitzer, Scott Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 2020 5:14 PM To: [email redacted]; Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I support an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that focuses on the core four, as was originally promised. While I believe that other groups can and should be included in the long term, we should be consistent in the approach and importantly, we should never allow antisemitism to creep into our schools by embracing theories that downplay its existence or the rights of Jews to have the same rights and protections as everyone else. Please consider adopting the IHRA guidelines on antisemitism as a tool to ensure that we embrace diversity without letting hate sneak in. Thank you for your work and keeping a commitment to consider impacts on California's diverse religious, racial and ethnic communities. Sincerely, Scott Spitzer
