From: Gerry Moskowitz Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum Change
I am pleased to see you are revising the curriculum to remove the anti-Jewish and anti-Israel slant. The BDS movement is designed to delegitimize Israel as the first step to eliminate her disguised as the free will of people to boycott. It is very clever and will easily fool people who are not familiar with the history of the people or region. It is not the job of the education system to promote this. The job of the system, is teaching this factually, not propaganda.
