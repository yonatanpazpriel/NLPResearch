From: Sandy Salinger Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum is Fatally Flawed
Hello.
The proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum is poorly written - there is no mention of anti-semitism, and in fact, contains anti-semitic tropes.
The one-sided view of the Israel/Palestinian conflict calls for the elimination of Israel, and would fuel anti-semitism.
Please do not subject our grandchildren, and the students of our state, to this fatally flawed proposed curriculum.
Please rewrite this curriculum!!!
Thank you. Sandra Salinger
