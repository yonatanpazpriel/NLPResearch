I am a concerned that in your quest to create a more open and understanding society (of which I applaud) you have inadvertently omitted anti-Semitism, a real, ongoing and current threat to Jews.

You speak of the displacement of Palestinians without providing the context and facts associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. You do not mention the Holocaust or the need for a Jewish state.

If your goal is to bring people together through cultural understanding I ask you to be a truly inclusive and not device. I ask you to tell the truth and do the honorable thing by include the Jewish people and their experience in the curriculum.
