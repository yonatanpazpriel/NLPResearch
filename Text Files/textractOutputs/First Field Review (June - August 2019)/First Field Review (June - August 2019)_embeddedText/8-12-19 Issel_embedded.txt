As a member of the Jewish Community and a 12 year member of the Berkeley Board of Education I urge caution in considering the adoption of the Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I watched for many years as the Ethnic Studies Course at Berkeley High School by was used by aggrieved minorities and misguided teachers to take revenge on students for past and present wrong doings whether imagined or real. Teachers were simply not prepared to handle these highly changed subjects and various groups (males, Caucasians, "privileged whites", high achieving AP students of all races, etc.) were denounced, and made to feel bad about themselves. Things finally got so bad that the school board voted to drop ethnic studies as a graduation requirement. While the requirement has since been re-instituted, it is simply a matter of time until the former problems re-emerge and "re-education" replaces teaching and learning. nd the culture and climate of learning is corrupted by rigid political correctness.
The anti-Semitic content in this proposed curriculum illustrates the difficulty inherent in such a curriculum. Consider the one-sided view of the of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and the failure to recognize the existence of anti-Semitism as we see in the present day attacks on our Jewish institutions in the United States and across the world today.
Content revisions, ongoing professional development and student opt-out provisions will need to be introduced to protect students from being victims of the kind of ignorant bigotry and prejudice which is the very part of our human nature we are trying to prevent. Thank you for your consideration.
