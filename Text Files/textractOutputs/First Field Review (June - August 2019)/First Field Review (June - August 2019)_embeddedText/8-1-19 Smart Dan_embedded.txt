"I would like to register my opposition to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. After review, I believe the curriculum to be an overtly political attempt to create a caste system in our public schools. This will do our children an incredible dis-service and further degrade our already sub-par schools. Please DO NOT proceed with approval."
