You must remember we are the smallest minority and have been hated for 1000s of years. Do not do anything to contribute to these prejudices!!! BDS is horrible, antisemitism brought on the death ovens! I know you are aware of the rising antisemitism that is happening in Europe and the USA. Stop adding to it! Jo-Ann Jacobson Alamo Ca.
