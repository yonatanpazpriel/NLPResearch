For shame that you do not plan to include Jewish Americans in your proposed curriculum. I could fill a page with the names of many famous Jewish men and women who belong on your list, and that would be only a portion of those who should be included. But instead, I will mention my late husband, Henry F. Epstein, who, as a very young man, heard the call during World War II and put his life on the line to fight Nazism in France. After the war, he worked for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and was a solid citizen, one of the Greatest Generation. You are rejecting his contribution and that of his buddies, along with many others who deserve recognition with this shortsighted policy.
