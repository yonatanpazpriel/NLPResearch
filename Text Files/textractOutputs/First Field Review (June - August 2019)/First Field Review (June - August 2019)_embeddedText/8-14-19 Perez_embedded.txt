Being a Jewish mother living in California, I am very concerned with the proposed curriculum!
It is inaccurate and misleading and reflects an anti-Jewish bias. Is this what California is about now?
I'm asking you to revise the proposed curriculum and not try to persuade and mold the minds of young children and create an unsafe and hostile environment for Jewish children in California.
