Hi. I understand that creating something new is always hard, but I don't understand why the ESMC draft doesn't include antisemitism. When it does acknowledge Jews (which doesn't seem to happen much), it seems to be discriminatory against them (and isn't that what this curriculum is meant to prevent?)
I know you don't have time to read long screeds, so I hope this short note helps.
