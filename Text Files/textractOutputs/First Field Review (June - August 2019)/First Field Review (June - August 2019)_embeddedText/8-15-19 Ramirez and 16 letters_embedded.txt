Dear Chairwoman Chao and Mem bers of the Instructional Quality Com1nission:

I \.Vrite to add my voice to that of the thousands of Californians and numerous organizations and coalitions that have expressed alarm over the current drat of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculun1 (ESMC). In its cu rrent iteration, the ESMC falls fall short of its goal to "prepare pu pils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures," as a result of its erasure of, and at times hostility to, the American Je\vish experience, and its one-sided representation of the highly coin plex and disputed conflict bet\vcen Israel and the Palestin ian people.

1 support and draw your attention to the detailed comments sub1nitted by the Institute for Curriculu1n Services and the Je\vish Public Affairs Committee, as \.Yell as by Jevvs Ind igenous to the Middle East and North Africa and the Legislative Jewish and LGBT caucuses, A1nong the concerns shared by these broad-based and diverse groups are 1) the omission of Je\VS as an ethnic group and of anti-Semitism as a form of bias and prejudice; 2) the negative stereotypes of Jews and Israel; and 3) the incl usion of, and support for, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BOS) 1novement, which presents a single, divisive viewpoint on a complex issue and creates a hostile environment for those who disagree with or question its principles.

California students deserve the best education possi ble, and \.vill surely benefit from an ethnic stud ies curriculu1n that serves to alleviate prejud ice and bigot1y and suppoits i nclusion, ein pathy, and critical thinking. The cu1Tent draft of the ESMC does not do th is. I hope that nly letter, along with the collective voice you are hearing fro1n Californians, \vill help the Con1mission to reflect on the deep flaws of the draft and demonstrate the need to introduce revisions. Among these are a sensitive inclusion of California Jewish history and culture, as well as mention of anti-Se1nitism and the eli1nination of irrelevant and infla1nmatoty polen1ics about Israel. These revisions are critical to the ESMC's ability to meet its own standards of equity, inclusiveness, and un iversally high expectations.

Thank you for your consideration.

Hello,
If you decided to dedicate your career to be a public servant, it's very clear that you care. You care about our children's education, success, future, and safety.
I'm writing to you as a CA resident and a very worried mom. The Department of Education California_ is creating a new ethnic studies curriculum. The curriculum does not recognize Jews as a minority in the US. Furthermore, it calls for boycotting Israel (in 3 different classes), attempt to explain the conflict in the middle east using a singlesided story, encourage aggression against Israelis, and spread hate against Israelis and Jews.
We had over +200 mass shootingshi is year. Almost all of them directed towards minorities and many of them - directed towards Israelis and Jews. I would not be able to sleep at night if I ever hear that the next shooter learned that "Jews are bad" in these classes - I hope you wouldn't either.
Iwill be terrified to send my kids to school knowing that their fellow students are thought that Israelis, Jews (or African American or Latinos or Muslims) - are bad and we should boycott them.
I hear of school bullying because of ethnicity is on the rise. I tear when I see a mass shooting in a synagogue. I also tear when I see mass shooting in a mosque.
I don't know why the people that wrote the curriculum want to spread hate. In a program for ethnic studies more than anything. The last thing we need in California and the US in general - is more hate. We don't need discrimination against Jews, Israelis or any other minority. We need more love. More respect. To all people and all minorities. So both you and I can send our kids to school and feel safe.
There are 1.2M Jews in California. There are also 300,000 Jews living in California and can bedirectly affected ifwe spread hate against them. The curriculum isdiscriminating them by neglecting to teach their history. It also ca!!s to ban and hate them. My child will have a much higher chance to get bullied just because he is Jewish. Because I happen to be born in Israel. Is that the education system we want to build in CA?
If you really do care about the safety of our children - please act now. You are my public representative and Itrust you would do so. Can you help?
Thank you,

Regarding: California EthnicStudies ModelCurriculum(ESMC)-AB 331
As a concernedAmerican and supporter of Israel,lam deeply troubled by the Cal fornia Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC} and truly alarmed that if AB 331is approved by the California state legislature in the comingdays, every highschool student inthe state will be required to take an ethnic studies course based on the ESMC before graduating. Iam aware that many individuals and groups affiHated withtheJewish community have already written to you about the ESMC's shocking omission of information about Amer ican Jews and antisemitism, its use of classic antisemitic stereotypes, andtis blatant anti-Israel bias.. This includes the California LegislativeJewish Caucus,who wrote to you thatthey "cannotsupport a curriculumthat erases the Amer ican Jewish experience,fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israelfor criticism and wo uld institutiona lize the teaching of antisemitic stereoty pes in our public schools."
Iam writing to you because l believe these concerns highlight a much deeper and graver problem, namely,
the fact that an educational curriculum can be hijacked by those pushing a political and hateful agenda. If not
addressed,this problem threatens to undermine not only the current effort to develop an ethnic studies model curriculum,but all other curricular efforts undertaken by the Department of Education. In order to prevent such abuseandthe extremely harmful consequencesthat willensue from it, Ibelieve
safeguardsmust beputinplace beforeanystate-mandated curriculumis adopted for use inCalifornia
classrooms.
Istrongly urge you,as wellas the Board of Education officials and statelegislators to immediately address this consequential problem by establishing safegua rds for ensuring that a ll state-sponsored curricula and
other instructional materials may never be created or used as tools of politicalindoctrination that promote
hatred and incite harm against any race, religion,group or individual.
Respectfully,

To Whom it May Concern, My name is Eitan Friedman, and I am a high schooler from Palo Alto. California's Board of Education has recently published a draft of a new ethnic studies course in California, that is open for public comment until August 15. Leaming about different minorities and their histories is of course of the utmost importance, however there is one big issue with this new curriculum. The course is blatantly antisemitic, anti-Israel, and pro-BOS. Despite Jews being a minority in the US facing growing discrimination, their hardships are not mentioned in the course. Last year saw a 21o/o increase in anti-jewish hate crimes, while hate crimes overall decreased 2.5%. Many synagogues across the nation have begun hiring armed security guards, for fear of being the next target. Of course, this could easily be dismissed to the fact that there wasn't enough room in the course to cover Jewish history. But not only does the course not mention this growing hatred towards Jews, it proceeds to support BDS, an antisemitic movement that is strongly against the notion of a Jewish state, and spreads lies and deceptions to further its own agenda. Many people believe that the goal of BDS is to promote policy change in Israel, when in fact their mission is the destruction of the state. That is what this course is supporting. If that's not enough, a list of ''Significant Figures to Cover" throughout the course is given, including: - Linda Sarsour, who claimed that you cannot be a zionist and a feminist, while Israel is one of the few countries in the middle east that gives women full rights - Helen Thomas, who lost her job as a White House correspondent for claiming that "Jews should get the hell out of Palestine" - Rashida Tlaib, a U.S. representative from Michigan, who is an open supporter of BDS, and is against the two-state solution Obviously, these figures are not representative of both sides of the conflict and are all antisemitic. As a Jew, and a student, I am appalled that such a curriculum could even be proposed, and would be embarrassed to see this course in my communities' school syllabus. I hope you can help change this course to be more representative of the truth, and not so objective. Yours Truly, Eitan Friedman Palo Alto 94303

Hi, We are writing to you as very worried Jewish parents in California. I hear repeated stories recently about kids that are bullied at school because there are IsraeliAmerican or Jewish. A mom in our community told us that her son was beat up in soccer practice because he is a "stinky Jew". Another child was banned for months in high school because he is Israeli-American. 20 other stories popped up just in the last 3 months.
We definitely need to teach kids about minorities llving in CA and their heritage. The education department started a wonderful initiative - adding an "ethnic studies curriculum". But the committee that was supposed to be unbiased and not politically swayed apparently has 3 known (possibly more) BOS activists that publicly act against Jews and Israelis. It intentionally neglected to include Jewish people and those of lsraeli-Amercian heritage.
1.2M Jews and 300K Americans living in CA are discriminated in this program. They also call for boycotting Israelis in several classes. This is not the California we love. This is a curriculum that calls for hate. We should learn about all minorities living in California in meaningful numbers and learn to love and respect each other. We can't call for any type of hateful acts and aggression in any school program. We can't discriminate against Jews and Israelis. We should celebrate our CA diversity and put aside politics.
I'm very worried about the safety of my children if their friends in school will be taught the suggested program. Whether we agree with Israel's actions or not, the last thing we want i.s for Ethnic Studies to drive an increased rate of violence and bullying in our schools. Please act imminently (before August 15th) to change the curriculum. Thank you, Inna and Alex Goldshteyn San Francisco California 94116.

Hello,
I'm writing to you as a very worried California parent. I'm Jewish and I was born in Israel. I hear repeated stories recently on kids that are bullied at school because there are Israeli-American or Jews.
The California Department of Education started a wonderful and blessed initiative - adding an "ethics study curriculum". But the committee that was supposed to be unbiased and not politically swayed apparently has 3 known (possibly more) BOS activists that publicly act against Jews and Israelis. It intentionally neglected to include Jews and Israeli-Americans heritage. 1.2M Jews and 300K Americans living in CA are discriminated in this program. They also call for boycotting Israelis in several classes of this program. We definitely need to teach kids about minorities living in CA and their heritage but NOT with this new program.
A mom in our community told us that her son was beat up in soccer practice because he is a "stinky Jew" in Los Altos CA. Another child was banned for months in high school because he is Israeli-Americans and the teacher in Albany CA taught the class that we should "ban everything related to Israel". An Asian-American 12-year-old boy gave his Jewish friend a "yellow Star of David" to put on his clothes since he never learned about the holocaust. He was just trying to be nice and read online that "this is how you mark Jews".
My grandpa lost his entire families in the holocaust in Poland. My grandma ran for her life after she was forced to convert to Islam in Iran. I was born and Israel and chose California as my home because it's a place of tolerance. Of love. Where everyone is accepted.
This is not the California we love. This is a curriculum that calls for hate. We should learn about all minorities living in California in meaningful numbers and learn to love and respect each other. We can't call for any type of hate acts and aggression in any school program. We can't discriminate against Jews and Israelis. We should celebrate our CA diversity and put aside politics. I'm very worried about the safety of my children if their friends in school will be taught the suggested program.
Whether we agree with Israel's policy or not (and I personally don't agree with many things that the Israeli government is doing either) - the last thing we want is for ethnic studies to increase the rate of violence and bul:ying incidents ln our schools.
Please act imminently (before August 15th) to change the curriculum.

I am appalled by the recommendations for the ethnic studies curriculum. It presents the BDS movement as a progressive social movement, and goes on to describe Israel as an apartheid state, and to use anti-Semitic tropes in its argument. The entire document represents a one-sided extreme left progressive viewpoint that does not represent the thinking of most Californians, especially of Jewish people who are not represented as a minority at all, and who are offended bv the descriptions of BDS and l$rael.

To Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
Iwrite to share my concerns with the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Iappreciate the hard work of the Instructional Quality Commission as it develops a curriculum that will serve as a modelfor the entire state. As an elected official and policymaker, Ihave continuously prioritized efforts to promote diversity and inclusion and I believe that it is critical that California students are educated about our state's rich history and diversity.
However, in its current form, the draft ESMC is deeply problematic as it relates to the Jewish and Israeli-Americancommunities. Of particularconcern, the draft ESMC omits the American Jewish experience, ignores antisemitism, unfairly attacks Israel, and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. This is unacceptable, especially given the dramatic increase in hate crimes against the Jewish Community, which has included the recent deadly attack at the Chabad synagogue in Poway earlier this year.
In light of recent events, it is more important than ever that we provide our students with accurate information and avoid curriculum that will marginalize or promote discrimination. Without significant edits, Ifear that the draft ESMC would marginalize and promote discrimination against our Jewish and Israeli-American students. For this reason, Istrongly encourage you to make significant edits to the draft ESMC.
Thank you again for your commitment to providing all California students with a holistic, accurate, and comprehensive education.
Sincerely yours,

Hi there!
My name is Abigail. I live in Sunnyvale California, I'm five years old and I will be going to kindergarten next year.
1 was looking forward to joining a California school as my parents (who immigrated here from Israel 10 years ago) always told rne how inclusive and loving the California school system is. But I understand this isn't true anymore. With a good intention of adding 'ethnic studies' that are supposed to promote equality and understanding, you were duped by the people who created the program to actually spread hate and biased misinformation against my ethnic group.
Can you please stop that from happening?

Ms. Soomin Chao Chair Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
To Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
I write as a concerned taxpayer, a member of the Jewish community, a long time activist for progressive causes and a 1nember of the Pacific Palisades Democratic Club Board of Directors. I am extremely concerned by the proposed curriculum f or the required "Ethnic Studies Program" in public high schools. The fact that Jews are omitted as an ethnic group, especially in these times when Jews and other ethnic minorities are being singled out, is unconscionable. The curriculum also presents a highly biased view of tl1e Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a classic sign of the "new anti-semitism" which is just an old hatred disguised amidst anti-Israel views.
Not long ago in Charlottesville, white nationalists shouted "Jews will not replace us" as a protester was killed. The Poway synagogue shooting this year killed 11Jews and was the most deadly anti-semitic attack in U.S. history. Moreover, t11e virulent and anti-semitic tropes found in the curriculum as it deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are deplorable. The "information" prese11ted about the conflict is inaccurate and misleading. Information about the BDS movement is one sided and fails to mention serious problems with the movement, such as that the damage it inflicts mainly affects Israeli universities and academics as well as Palestinian owned businesses - https://www.jpost.com/IsraelNews/Palestinian-employees-l 1urt-by-BDS-speak-up-about-its-negative-effects-56051 1 . I am most shocked, however, about the blatant singling out of one ethnic group and one country, Jews and Israel, in the guise of a program aimed at understanding and preventing ethnic and racial discrimination. [ am a n immigrant and do not support many of the policies of my native governn1ent, Argentina. However, singling out Argentina for specific censure amid hundreds of countries in the world would be ridiculous and obviously prejudiced. Yet it has occurred to no one in the group designing this program that singling Israel and its people for censure because of its government's policies while ignoring other countries, other conflicts, other human rights violat ions occurring every day is imposing a double standard that is anti-semitic in itself.
As a taxpayer and active voter I demand that an investigation be made as to the motivations behind t11e curriculum and its singularly biased perspective. Wl10 prepared it? How was this singular bias allowed to continue? VVhy were opposing views not presented? VVhy, most glaringly, were Jews as an ethnic class not included in it? Hate crimes against Jews increased more than those against any other ethnic group in 2018, and represented the largest single growth of religious based hate crimes.

BDS is a political,not a social, movement and is a continuation of the "Don't Buy from the Jews" action instituted by the Arab League decades prior to the establishment of the Jewish state.
The aim, according to its modern "founder" is the destruction of srael.
There is no apartheid inside srael; sraeli Arabs have full rights as citizens.The situation has nothing in common with the anti-apartheid movement against South Africa. However, no surroundingArab state (nor Gaza, nor the Palestinian Authority) allows a Jew to live within its borders.
BDS is a straw-man argument that would serve well as an example for a class on rhetoric or critical thinking but has no place in this course without the addition of factual opposition.As written, this is blatant propaganda. Most mainstream Jewish organizations recognize "BDS" as an antisemitic movement and it has no place within EthnicStudiesasidefrom demonizingan historicallyoppressed population.
Iclose with my observation of a disturbing thrust in this "model" course. Rather than inclusiveness,there is a negative emphasis on celebrating divisions. Itis possible to teach ways to honor and celebrate our differences without weaponizing them towards
others. *

Dear Chairwoman Chao -
Ihave many serious concerns about the "Draft Ethnic Studies Curriculum" as currently presented.This is a very long document, difficult to parse,and the deadline for public comment is fast approaching.With that in mind,Iwill focus on only a few of my reservations.
1. ngeneral:thedocumentisfilledwithobscure andincomprehensiblejargon .
My suggestion is that the language of this document be reviewed with the aim of more clarity, using standard writing style and practice.
2. There is a glaring omission inthe Glossary provided: ['A" No line iteml.
In a document supposedly devoted to equity and inclusion,there is no mention of Antisemitism. For two thousand years the Jewish people have been excluded, demonized,discriminated against,and slaughtered,universally acknowledged as the mode/ for what is termed "The Other." Jews are about 3�/o of the American population; yet year after year the FBIreports that they are 60-65�/o of hate crimes committed and that incidence is increasing dramatically.
3. However, a definition ofIslamophobia is found later in the document C'I' Lines 239-40].
Two similar hatreds, but one is excluded while the other is highlighted. While sI lamophobia is a problem in America, it is of recent origin and the number of violent
incidents is far below those targeting Jews. Just what is going on here? This smacks of a judgement akin to that of Orwell's Animal Farm Some animals are more equal than others.
4. All of "B" Lines 30-40 is devoted to only one item, the Boycott srael movement ("BDS").
One wonders why this is even here,other than to offer a completely misleading definition of what it is. If this is to be included in the document,some correct.ions and clarifications are inorder:

In his 1948 book, "God in the Dock," C.S. Lewis stated:
"Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good _of its victim may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.........thosewho torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience." The Draft Ethnic Studies Curriculum is a disaster in the making. No amount of socio-babble will justify this Curriculum which will serve to divide rather than unite students. From every point of view this Curriculum presents a hazard rather than a benefit. The Curriculum is unacceptable and must not be implemented.
Sincerely,

To Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
I am writingto raise objections to the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I have spent my
career as an Executive Field Officer in the United Nations. In that role I gained significant firsthand experience on the ground in areas of conflict around the world and have been witness to unthinkable tragedies and atrocities resulting from the overzealous expression of ethnicity. Students in the age categories covered by the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum are very impressionable and serving up a Curriculum of examples arbitrarily selected out of the broad-spectrum of exemplars provides information that is totally void of perspective.
At a time when it is more important than ever to stress our commonalities rather than our differences to
young students, the Ethnic Studies Curriculum will sew division rather than unity. This county's strength derives from its fusion of ethnicities. Any Curriculum that serves to deconstruct the 'melting pot' will
make students feel apart from the main.
Injustice cannot be tolerated, nor can it be trivialized by a facile, biased view, even if politically correct or in vogue. Injustice can only be eliminated by providing people the tools with which to erase it. This Curriculum is out of sync with reality.
The course material itself is biased, highlighting certain ethnicities while ignoring injustices to others. An obvious omission is the skyrocketing crimes against Jews - antisemitism. The fact that this phenomenon has been virtually absent from the Curriculum serves as an excellent example of the recklessness of the
Curriculum and the negligence of its drafters. And if it was not negligence, then it was candid racism.

The Department of Education California is creating a new ethnic studies curriculum.
I have taken the time to look into the suggested curriculum.
There are many points within this curriculum that need to be closely examined and addressed.
First of all, the curriculum does not recognize Jews as a minority in the US. Furthermore, it calls for
boycotting Israel (in 3 different classes), attempts to explain the conflict in the Middle East using a singlesided story, encourages aggression against Israelis, and spreads hate against Israelis and Jews.
The section called ''Sample Course Models" includes false representation of history that is biased against Israel, under the section "THE HISTORY OF ARAB IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES." The curriculum also spreads falsehoods under the following topics in the section "Arab American Studies Course OutlineH:
1. Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter. 2. Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel. 3. Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico.
As a Jewish immigrant from Israel, Ifind this extremely disturbing and alarming. Finding such anti-semitic statements being suggested for a formal school curriculum brings me back to the stories I heard about the state of mind in Germany, prior to the second world war.
Iwould be terrified to send my kids to school' here knowing that their fellow students were being taught that Israelis or Jews (or African American, Latinos, Muslims or any other ethnic group) should be boycotted and suppressed.
So far, we have seen over 240 mass shootings this year in the United States, almost all of them directed towards minorities, and some of them directed towards Israelis and Jews. Such a curriculum can form the next shooter who learns about Jews/Israel in a negative context.
A program for ethnic studies should be promoting ethnic acceptance and not divergence. The last thing we need in California, and the US in general, is more hate.
There. are over a million Jewish people living in California, including around 300,000 Israelis, who can be directly affected by such a curriculum. This would be the first step towards an even easier path to propagating such topics to other curriculums throughout the United States and further escalating the antisemitism in existing ones.
Iurge you to please take a stand and actively fight to prevent this curriculum from being accepted.
Thank You! Shoham Yam and Neomi Brunshteyn Campbel!
