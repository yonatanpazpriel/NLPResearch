Not including sons & daughters of Judaism is inferring The Bible doesn't exist, that God did not have a son born to Jews, that the Diaspora of two thousand years did not happen to the Jews, that The Holocaust did not take 6,000,000,000 Jewish lives, that Jewish Supreme Court Justices did not exist, that Jewish Baseball Players (All Professional Sports) did not exist, that the minds of Golda Meir, Eli Wiesel, Ben Gurion, Great World Authors, Great World Painters, Great World Doctors, Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Theologians, Archaeologists, contributors to Science and The Space Age, do and did not exist.
I can understand the backwardness of many southern States and Politicians to play this "Conservative Hate Game" but California makes me scratch my head!
How has decency, decorum, and ethics bottled itself-up in 2019 and flushed itself down the historical toilet? We used to have Great Minds in America. Now, every little man and woman has become their own God. What a terrible shame.- BMB/ Massachusetts
