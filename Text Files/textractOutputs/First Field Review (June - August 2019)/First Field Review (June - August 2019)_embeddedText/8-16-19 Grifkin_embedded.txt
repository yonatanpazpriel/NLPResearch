I strenuously object to the draft model curriculum. The curriculum covers BDS as a legitimate social justice movement, even though it has been wisely condemned by our government as antisemitic. The curriculum compounds this grievous error by omitting ANY mention of antisemitism. At a time of rising hate crimes against Jews in California, the broader US and the world, this is truly unconscionable. It has been merely a few months since a man filled with hate against Jews killed worshippers at the Poway synagogue. The proposed model curriculum will breed further hate against Israel and the Jews. It must be redrafted to exclude coverage of BDS, and to acknowledge the historical and ongoing struggle against antisemitism.
