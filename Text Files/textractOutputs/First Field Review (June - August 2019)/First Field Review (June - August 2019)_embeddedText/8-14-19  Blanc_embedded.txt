From: Steve Blanc Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am very upset and I vote! And I share! This curriculum is a sham and I am writing to communicate my outrage at the following aspects. This curriculum:
� Has excluded Jews from ethnic groups mentioned. � Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. � The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective. � A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included.
What in the world are you doing??!! I am asking you to step back from this and correct these lies and misrepresentation of facts. What are you thinking?
