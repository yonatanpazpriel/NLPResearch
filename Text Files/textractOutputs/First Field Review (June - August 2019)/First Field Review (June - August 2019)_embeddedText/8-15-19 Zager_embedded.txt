From: Robert Zager Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 9:16 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Greetings:
The Draft calls to mind George Orwell's warning in 1984, "He who controls the past controls the future. He who controls the present controls the past."
The Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is a compendium of ignorance and dogma. It is a screed of grievance politics divorced from the disciplines it claims are being covered in a interdisciplinary manner. Rather than refuting baseless material point by point, one merely needs to look at the treatment of the word "hxrtory" to see how the Draft is inconsistent with collective human knowledge. The origin of the English word "history" has nothing to do with the English word "his." The authors ascribe their own meaning to a word, ascribe their own context to the word and then create their own lexicon for the purpose of demonstrating how, despite the actual derivation and meaning of "history," new words must be invented and foisted upon the populace in order to right a wrong that does not exist.
The next step in advancing the legislative mandate for an ethic studies curriculum should be the appointment of a new drafting committee which excludes all of the present authors and is staffed by subject matter experts (e.g., economists, historians, sociologists) and not practitioners of ethic studies.
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.
Best regards,
Bob Zager
