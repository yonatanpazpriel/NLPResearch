Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2, lines 30 � 40 � please include more information about why BDS is problematic for the Jewish community, as you have done below with mentioning the difficulties of capitalism for people of color (page 2, lines 44-45) page 234, line 4957, 4958; page 242, line 5157-5161; page 264-269; - These references include anti-Israel references, with no acknowledgement of Israel as the state for stateless Jews after the holocaust, nor how the narrative of antiIsrael advocacy has been hijacked into generalized anti-Semitism. I strongly encourage that a unit on Jewish American and anti-Semitism be added to the curriculum. Currently, anti-Semitism is mentioned once, only in Chapter 2, page 289, line 6238, which acknowledges anti-Semitism as a form of social oppression. Adding a new section, will help bring balance to the two sections I cited above � the picture becomes much less clear when one deals with both sides of an issue. Second, anti-Semitism against Jews is on the rise both in the US and worldwide, including the recent shooting at an area synagogue. Including a unit that deals with this complex topic would round out an otherwise deep and thoughtful curriculum.
