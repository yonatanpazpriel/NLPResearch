From: James Kooren Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 10:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New proposed California Curriculum
As a teacher myself I am afraid our students are missing the ability to define why we are a country, what is our form of government, how it happened and by who's hand. Our students can barely read and write as they currently are. Please do not make up new words when our students barely can use the language we have as it currently stands. Please do not let education become a place of virtue signaling for the designers of curriculum. Leave the political battles for the politicians. Leave morals to the parents. Focus on reading, writing and economics. Get them to understand how to balance a budget and not go into debt. Design that curriculum Instead of dropping people who formed our free country with all it faults for people of lgbtq etc. who didn't. Let them be studied in college after our students know why we are the leaders of freedom and liberty and we are a republic and not a democracy.
