Page 2, line 30 includes a definition of BDS without offering any critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. In fact, recently the US Senate passed a bill that opposes BDS. As a Jewish parent, I know first-hand how proponents of BDS intimidate Jewish students on our college campuses. I certainly would regret having those same sentiments in our California public schools. As a respected online educator, I also believe that education should be all about presenting balanced views from both sides, to encourage students to think and debate, not to indoctrinate students with a single viewpoint. Page 234 promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering their communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Page 237 uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country Page 242 frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 Was as fact, with no alternative opinion. Pages 256, 264-260 encourages use of a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content about Israel or content critical of Palestinian leaders.

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
