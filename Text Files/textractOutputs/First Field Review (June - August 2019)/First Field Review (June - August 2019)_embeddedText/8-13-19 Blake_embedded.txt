I am a lifetime resident of California and the parent of two elementary school children. When I was an Aragon High School student I interned for the late Congressman Tom Lantos. As a Holocaust survivor himself, I believe he would be appalled by the proposed ESMC curriculum.
Attached please find my comments and concerns about the proposed curriculum (ESMC). As a Jewish American, I am very disturbed by the numerous instances of anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli content and course material throughout the ESMC. I strongly encourage the Dept. of Education to seriously reconsider numerous aspects of the ESMC that are demeaning to Jewish Americans, particularly those who support the Jewish national homeland, the State of Israel. In politicizing the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the ESMC is highly polarizing and will divide students rather than bring them together to an improved multi-cultural sensitivity respectful of all ethnicities, including Jews. In this time of growing division in our country, I hope our education system will be a source to unite rather than divide.
Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
Best regards,
Sarah Blake
