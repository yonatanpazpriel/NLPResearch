I am so glad my children have graduated high school already. It is hard enough to find time to teach objective courses like math, grammar, science, and computer classes; now amazing California wants to indoctrinate students into even more left-leaning ideas, like "hxrstory" instead of "history. It sounds like aggrieved and underemployed racial studies majors are writing education policy in California.
Leave our kids alone!
