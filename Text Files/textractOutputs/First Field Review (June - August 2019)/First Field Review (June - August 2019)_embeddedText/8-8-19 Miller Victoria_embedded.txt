Jews have been the most oppressed people in the history of the World. Very disturbed by the proposed inclusion of BDS which has been shown to be racist with no prospective or critical voices. (p 234).
Falsely equates Israel stopping terrorists from entering their country with US policies with Mexico (P. 234).

Refers to Israel-Palestine as a whole is an Arab country. Jews in Israel are the indigenous people with 3,000 years of heritage and claim to the land. This seems to be negated with this proposed curriculum language (pg 237).
Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
