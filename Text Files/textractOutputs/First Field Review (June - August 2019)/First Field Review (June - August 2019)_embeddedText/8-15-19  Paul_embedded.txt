General

Leyla Woods I have read the August 12, 2019, joint announcement by the State

Board of Education committee charged with developing an ethnic studies curriculum for

California schools. I very much hope that the redraft of the curriculum will rectify the biases and

omissions in the first version, including a neglect of the long-standing problem of anti-Semitism

in the United States. I am looking forward to the next, and improved, version of the ethnic

studies curriculum.
