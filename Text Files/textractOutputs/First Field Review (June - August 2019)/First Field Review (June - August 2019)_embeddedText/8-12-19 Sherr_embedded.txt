I write to express my deep concern about a proposed ethnic studies curriculum in which Jews as a minority are absent, and the nation state of the Jewish people is demonized. It is remarkable that such a curriculum be proposed at a time when the largest number of anti-semitic incidents in the U.S. in 2018 occurred in California. In my view, this proposed curriculum reflects intersectionality run amok because there are no Jews allowed in the intersection. I urge you to reject this curriculum unless it is revised dramatically to be inclusive of Jews and far less onesided in its treatment of the Israel-Palestine question.
Respectfully submitted,
