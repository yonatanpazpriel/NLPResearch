Jews have been one of the longest victims of oppression. They have been exiled from country after country. The Holocause and aftermath must be covered in the curriculum. cvering the Palistinians too is an obvious goal of an ethnic studies curricuum, however, taking a totally biased view by touting BDS is ridicuous!
