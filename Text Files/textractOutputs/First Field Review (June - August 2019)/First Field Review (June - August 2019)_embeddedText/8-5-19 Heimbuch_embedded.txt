While I applaud your attempt to attempt to approach this issue, the suggested document is horrible. I am a left leaning liberal and this goes way too far. In addition to being pompous it is too one sided to be considered an attempt at an academic approach to the subject. What happened to trying to teach facts not opinion? This will make us the laughing stock of the US. It is so far out of alignment it will totally turn off parents as propaganda. It is this type of snobbery that made people vote for Trump.
