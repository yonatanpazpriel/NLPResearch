797 and 799 -- The verb "were" needs to be "were/are" on both pages. Regarding land, this is still Native land, regardless of nominal ownership by colonial society. Regarding erasure, a form of genocide, strictly speaking, it is on-going, and the spirit of this proposed curriculum is to move past that. Keeping Native experience with colonialization in the present, as an on-going dynamic, is a crucial part of this effort. Also, Native sources need to be used much more than these source lists show. Immersion in the Indigenous voice is critical. 4111 -- When the Gold Rush is mentioned, it should always include the word genocide, as this is historical fact, and needs consistent acknowledgement. See Dr. Benjamin Madley's An American Genocide, among other sources.
4127 -- When Native contributions to WW2 are mentioned, Vietnam should be included, as thousands of Native soldiers worked with Indigenous people within Vietnam and neighboring states to help protect them from the NVA. Brave Hearts, Wounded Souls is a good source for Native involvement with the armed services.

4361 -- When talking about slavery in California, the Mexican period must be included, as it was an extension of the Spanish period, and it is too often "leapfrogged" over, from the Mission era to the Gold Rush. Including the difficulties for Indigenous during the Mexican period allows for more thorough examination of racism toward Indigenous within the Hispanic community today, thereby allowing for a deeper recognition of cultural roots and experience within all communites in California, but specifically between and within Indigenous and "Hispanic" peoples. This study helps "Indigenization" with Hispanic communities, in my experience, which furthers deep solidarity in those communities.

4774 -- When talking about mascot images and what they imply, the San Francisco 49ers must be discussed in light of the genocide the people called "the 49ers" actually perpetrated. Not addressing the historical facts of who the 49ers were and what their actions and attitudes were continues a legacy of celebrating genocide, albeit unconsciously. It is part of the erasure of California Indigenous today! Regarding source material for images and names, Ward Churchill's "Let's Spread the Fun Around" is excellent. 459 -- The list of Native American notable figures needs to include Russell Means, who has excellent and accessible material in Where White Men Fear to Tread. D'Arcy McNickle is also a critical figure, for The Surrounded. Dr. Darryl Babe Wilson, author of The Morning the Sun Went Down, has been critical in Native California. Another California Native activist is Gregg Castro Salinan Ohlone), who has excellent, very accessible and important work in News from Native California. There are very many others in the world of literature.
