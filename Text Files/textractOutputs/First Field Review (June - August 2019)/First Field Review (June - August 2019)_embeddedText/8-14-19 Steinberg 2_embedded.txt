From: Randy Steinberg Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 10:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum needs to be revised
I am a progressive, but dislike the curriculum for a number of reasons. First, rather than promoting critical thinking - something that is in short supply these days - it promotes a single point of view on many subjects, including, but not limited to, capitalism and the Arab-Israeli conflict. It also deliberately excludes anti-Semitism and the contributions of Jews to the state of California.
I agree with the Legislature's Jewish Caucus when they said that the curriculum "fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-semitic stereotypes in our public schools."
Ethnic studies should be taught - it's important to do so. But this is the wrong way to do it. Please revise it. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Randy Steinberg
