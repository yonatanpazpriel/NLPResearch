From: Shenkar, Miriam Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 3:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum
The draft model adds to the climate of antisemitism through the lack of education about the topic of antisemitism and as well as through the expressed sympathy with antiZionism and the support of BDS as a movement and philosophy. To correct these biases the model needs to change. Thank you for understanding that we must all work against antisemitism in this country and that designing a curriculum which avoids the topic is simply cruel and self serving.
