Page 1, line 19. Since this Definition of Ethnic studies is part of the premise of why to study ethnicity, this is a muddle. (line 21) The term "people of color" (and its variations: students of color, communities of color) is used throughout the curriculum. Yet, it remains undefined. Are Arabs people of color? Are Jews? Are Lebanese Christians? Are Lebanese Muslims? Page 2, line 21. Homosexuality is not an ethnicity ("homophobia"). Islam is not an ethnicity, it is a religion ("islamophobia"). Being Jewish is both an ethnicity and a religion. Yet "Anti-Semitism" is not cited in this section, despite FBI statistics showing hate crimes against Jews rank much higher than against Muslims year after year. In this model curriculum, Anti-Semitism and references to Jews is virtually absent, except in reference to the Jewish State (more below) Page 2, Line 32-38. This paragraph is beyond Orwellian. "Ethnic Studies is xdisciplinary" (I take this to mean some kind of academic discipline, since your "glossary" definition is circular). Yet it is "undisciplinary" (I take this to mean not a discipline). I know "Terms...are defined in the glossary," but the use of these terms is to obscure, not clarity, what Ethnic Studies is. Why? Page 233-87 Jews are virtually absent from this Ethnic Studies curriculum, except as an "addendum" to the Arab American section. Here, the world's only

Jewish State is open to vilification and slander. Why is a course about the ethnic makeup of the United States foraging into Foreign Policy?

In the Sample Topics are: Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter, Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel. Key concepts: The Nakba. Why are these cited approvingly, when...

The "Black Lives Matter" organization has call Israel an "Apartheid State" and said that it engages in "genocide." Both of these are factually untrue and inciteful.

Omar Barghouti, one of the founders of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement as well as many other supporters and officials of BDS, have advocated violence and the end of the Jewish State - see https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/bds-in-their-own-words .

The re-establishment of Israel and Jewish sovereignty in the ancient Jewish homeland, after 2000 years of exile culminating in the Holocaust, should not be looked at as a "disaster." Yet, by using the Arabic term, "Nakba," this is the only viewpoint of Israel that students are allowed, using the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.

Compared to the less than half dozen references to Jews - all negative - in the Model Curriculum, there are 55 (out of 300) pages devoted to Arab Americans virtually all positive. Nine pages alone are devoted to Islamophobia. Why?

) there were 1,679 offenses motivated by religious bias in the U.S., reported by law enforcement. This is a very small number, considering a population of over 300 million.

Of these religious bias hate crimes, 58.1 percent were anti-Jewish. 18.7 percent were anti-Islamic (Muslim).

General

These basic facts of the rarity of Islamophobia are missing in this curriculum, so what would students taking this Model Curriculum walk away thinking? Islamophobia is pervasive in the U.S.; Anti-Semitism is non-existent; Jews and others favoring the Jewish right to be free in their own ancient homeland support genocide. This model curriculum promotes indoctrination over education. For instance, In the "African American Studies Course Outline" (page 47), the list of "Significant figures," key people in the Civil Rights Movement like Martin Luther King, Jr., Ralph Abernathy, Rosa Parks and Thurgood Marshall are missing, while marginal and radical figures are overemphasized.

The Glossary besides Definitions, has many "re-definitions." Pejorative wording abounds. Look up: Capitalism, Citizenship, Gender, Political, and Whiteness in the Model Curriculum Glossary, then check those words in a standard dictionary.

Everyone has an ethnicity or ethnic background. Most ethnicities are absent in this Ethnic studies curriculum.

This curriculum has a dystopian view of the United States. If implemented, a dystopian California is more likely to result.

Having worked with the California Dept. of Education in the 1990s, I have seen it go from an incompetent to a thoroughly competent agency -- in promoting

Intersectionality, identity politics, racial animosity, Anti-Semitism and AntiAmericanism, as exemplified in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. If that is what the Administration and the Legislature of California want, don't change a word of this Model Curriculum. If it is not what they want, scrap the whole project.
