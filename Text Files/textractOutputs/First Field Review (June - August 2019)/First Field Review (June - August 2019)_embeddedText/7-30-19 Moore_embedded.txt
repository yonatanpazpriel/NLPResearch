Definition of "Capitalism" includes this odd statement: "In a capitalist economy, surplus
value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified."
Apart from the questionable term "commodified," the statement is patently false. Do Apple, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Google, Intel, and IBM, to name a few, generate profit from "human labor" and "commodified" (sic) products? Not at all. They have generated success and profit from proprietary products and services based on the skill, ingenuity and drive of their workforces at all levels as well as the system of laws that protects their inventions. By the way, both Microsoft and Google are currently led by "persons of color" as I understand the term.
