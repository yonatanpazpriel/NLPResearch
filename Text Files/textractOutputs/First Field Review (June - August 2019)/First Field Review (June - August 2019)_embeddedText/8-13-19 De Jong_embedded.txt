From: Joyce De Jong Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model curriculum
To whom it may concern: I have just learned that the model curriculum is anti Semitic in many ways and also untruthful in the way it represents Israel. Also that so many working on this project have a known bias toward Jews. This is very wrong. Do not allow this curriculum to be approved. Thank you. Joyce De Jong
