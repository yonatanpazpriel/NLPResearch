Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I believe that California's kids deserve an opportunity to understand and embrace the precious role of diversity of all citizens, but also � personally � on the Armenian- American experience. However, the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum lacks in providing that enriching factor that makes California the great state that it is today. We hope that the Curriculum in its current form will be reconsidered to make up for the lack of cultural competency. Thank you!
