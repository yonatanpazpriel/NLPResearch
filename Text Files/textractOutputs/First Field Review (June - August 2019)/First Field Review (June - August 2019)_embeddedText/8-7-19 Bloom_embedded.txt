The concept of the BDS movement is offensive to us as is its mission and description, which are based upon falsehoods and half-truths. However, if this group is "required reading" for ethnic studies, then it is imperative that the other side, Israel's perspective on the Palenstinian plight among their own Arab bretheren should be described as well. The manipulations being orchestrated by PLO and Muslim Brotherhood who take almost all international aid and use it for weapons, tunnels into Israel and distribution to families of those who have perpetrated the most heinous acts.....all in the name of the destruction of Israel should be presented too. They are puppets of the Iranian Ayetollah and his regime. Unfortunately the common family of Palestinians is not able to better themselves.....mostly due to the police power exerted and religious shaming done by the PLO and Muslim Brotherhood.....both terrorist groups who control this group of people. The Bibliography is so telling....it is so incomplete and so biased. We wonder at the blinders used in this myopic choice of materials. With only a few races as the basis of curriculum, this course study seems to promulgate racism of other types and in fact creates future racists. Why is there no mention of Antisemitism? Has any people been so enslaved (Egypt) and systematically murdered (Nazi Germany) than the Jews throughout time? We must urge California to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination throughout the World, yesterday and again rearing its ugly head throughout Europe.

While we applaud the concept and description of "Culturally responsive/relevant teaching," Most of the rest of the glossary descriptions are so filled with "noise" and prejudices that it clearly lacks sensitivity for other cultures and backgrounds. If the description is truly the aim.....seemingly you've missed the mark. Perhaps a broader and more diverse group "cultures and backgrounds" are needed in the making of this curriculum so that biases are revealed and counterpoints are presented. Without both sides you risk rewriting history and our children's futures....or is that your intent?
