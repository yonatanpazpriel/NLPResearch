From: Dennis Krentz Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 9:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Re: proposed ethnic studies model cirriculum
If this program is meant to be an anti-capitalist screed, it succeeds beyond anybody's expectations. I assume that somebody at some time wanted it to be a true study and thoughtful discussion of ethnic studies. The proposed program fails miserably in that regard. I am firmly opposed to the content of this so-called "model curriculum".
