As an educator myself, it is with great respect that I request the removal of BDS and any other anti-Israel bias from the proposed Ethnic Studies program for 2020. It is important that a course given in any school present both sides so that children and adults understand all sides of a given situation. Unfortunately, the BDS does not do that. It promotes hate and division. It might be beneficial to add to the course lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group; including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the middle east, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. BDS is defined as a movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". This is a very serious statement. It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no voices of critical perspectives about this campaign of hate which seeks to end Israel's existence Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Also on this page, the sample lesson promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent men, women, and children and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.
