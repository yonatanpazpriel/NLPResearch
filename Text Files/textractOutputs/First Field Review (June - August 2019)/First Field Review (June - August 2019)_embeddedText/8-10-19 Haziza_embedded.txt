It's a shame the Californians who are supposed to represent teachers and educators even consider to implement such a one sided shameful excuse for a model curriculum. Jews are mentioned not as a minority that contributed to the state of California, but as a bully that enslave and discriminate against Palestinians. Never mind all other Arab countries around Israel the commit genocide, starvation and women/minority discrimination against their own people. The BDS movement is mentioned as a legitimate freedom movement, when all it does is create hate and perpetuate antisemitism. In many countries throughout the world BDS was declared an anti-Semitic movement which uses Nazi methods to incite against Jews. Only in California it is inducted into the school system, along with songs meant to saw hate and violent. Know this, Californians, every expression, incitement, or sword pointed against Israel, will soon turn against America as well, since these two countries share the values of freedom and equality!!!
