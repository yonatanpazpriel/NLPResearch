August 12, 2019 RE: Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
On behalf of the Northern California Foco of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS), I write in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
The National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies is the academic organization that serves academic programs, departments and research centers that focus on issues pertaining to Mexican Americans, Chicana/os, and Latina/os. The Association was formed in 1972, during the height of the Chicana/o movement, calling for the development of a space where scholarship and Chicana/o students could develop their talents in higher education. For more than 30 years, students, faculty, staff, and community members have attended the NACCS annual conference to present their scholarly papers--many of which have spun into important intellectual pillars.
Given that Ethnic Studies curriculum works to foreground an alternative vision of U.S. history and culture, now more than ever this area of study is necessary. Ethnic Studies works to understand theories of racism and racialization of the Americas and histories of colonization, imperialism, segregation, slavery, genocide, persecution, internment, mass incarceration, and other forms of systemic, structural, and institutional forms of dehumanization experienced by different racial/ethnic and gendered groups. By learning how to analyze structures of colonization, imperialism, domination, and marginality our students of all backgrounds can effectively explain the importance of race and ethnicity. Along with the creation of cultural and artistic expressions and movements of resistance, our students can also better imagine strategies to dismantle these violent and oppressive structures.
