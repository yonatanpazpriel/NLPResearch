From: Janice Orlowski Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:20 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: governor Subject: Your proposed curriculum is Anti Semitic and Anti Israel
Dear Ethnic Studies Department:
You should be ashamed of yourselves for your blatantly racist, Anti-Semitic proposed curriculum. Perhaps you have learned nothing from history... Please make yourselves familiar with Nazi propaganda before WWII where Jews were marginalized and stereotyped. We all know what happened.
I consider myself to be a liberal Californian and I vote. The lies and misrepresentations being put forward have no place in our educational curriculum. Please look closely into those who are writing this proposal to determine their agendas and biases, and do not continue to espouse such hate.
