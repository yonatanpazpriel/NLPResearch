From: Ronnie Shaw Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 3:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum Team
Hello, I know that you all are hard workers and have the best intentions, but is this new Ethnic curriculum really necessary? Our kids in California need to learn the basics: to concentrate on reading, writing, math, and to think for themselves.
As I understand the new Ethnic Studies will undermine what our country stands for. Politics is not needed in the public school setting.
Please abandon this waste of time and get back to the basics for the sake of our children.
Thank you for you time.
Sincerely, Veronica Shaw
