I am writing to comment on the lack of specific and unbiased curricula on Jewish Culture and Studies. Judaism is not just a faith tradition, but a distinct ethnicity, with a history and varied culture of its own. Even more significantly, by including an Arab studies curriculum that is distinctly Anti-Israel and that repeats racist and Anti-Jewish tropes about Jews controlling the media, the proposed curriculum as it stands would tend to promote violence toward a community that is already vulnerable in today's America.

I speak as a member of the Jewish community, one who is not personally a Zionist, but who has been endangered by right-wing extremists who desire to silence and threaten Jews and as an educator who believes in tolerance and openness.

The curriculum misrepresents Jewish culture and Israel itself, which is quite diverse and composed of many people who oppose the occupation and the founding of settlements.

I am a member of an organization that aims to educate the public on racist misperceptions. As such, I object to any material that would enflame this violence. All curricula should be peer-reviewed by ethnic studies experts on all sides of issues of this sort and should be purged of inflammatory and overtly racist statements.

I would appreciate if you would take this issue very seriously, and make changes to the proposed curriculum.

Sincerely,
