This is by way of comment regarding your mandate to provide a guide for "Ethnic Studies".
I was fortunate to attend school in Los Angeles during the '50's and '60's when a Republican administration controlled Sacramento and education was taken seriously. In those days students studied those subjects which were properly considered imperative for a person's future. Emphasis was placed on reading and writing skills as well as mathematics. Time was not wasted on foolish "Politically Correct" garbage such as the lunacy being implemented by Sacramento with this latest codified propaganda.
Students do need to learn history unvarnished by liberal bigots, and they need to clearly understand current events without that information being passed through a corrupting filter. To that end stress must be placed on reading and writing, abilities which tests have clearly demonstrated are lacking in todays graduates.
As a taxpayer, and a resident of this state, I am personally offended by clowns in government attempting to indoctrinate and subvert young minds with an ideology which promulgates false information.
Your ludicrous "Mandate" demands careful disquisition and subsequent dismissal.
Sincerely,
Hans Schieder
