To Whom It May Concern:
After reading through the documents on the proposed ethnic studies curriculum, I have the following comments:
* I found it somewhat difficult to wade through the politically correct newspeak that makes up much of this document.
* I was very distressed to see that one of the most discriminated and persecuted ethnic groups in all of history, the Jews, are not included in this curriculum. That fact alone labels this document as racist.
* I feel that California students would be far better served by greater concentration on the basic skills of English, math, science and social studies. However, since ethnic studies are now a poorly conceived requirement, there should be a rigorous attempt to present more balanced views than that of currently faddish political ideology.
