As an educator in San Francisco I fully support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. Students deserve to have curriculum that mirrors the beautiful diversity of the world.

I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans. If education is the most powerful weapon in which to change the world, we need education that is unbiased that teaches about marginalized people so that we can challenge current xenonophobia and discrimination. Every student deserves to have an education that speaks to their history, in particular Arab Americans in this time and their history of migration to the US (page 236). Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
