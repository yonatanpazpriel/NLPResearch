From: Elisabeth Schwartz Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 3:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear State of CA educators,
I am deeply troubled and upset by the draft of the model curriculum that I just read, as it excludes antisemitism and includes BDS. That is incredibly one-sided and dangerous. BDS promotes hatred and violence, as shown in various video clips and reports of bullying.
I hope you understand the anti-semitism I often see and hear now. I am on a school board of a public school, and I have anti-semitic language directed at me during the public meetings, but I have no recourse as there are no anti-semitism laws that I can fall back on. I can send video clips of that if you want to see them as I OPRA'd them from my board of ed.
Please reconsider and remove BDS from this training, and include anti-semitism. This is a deeply upsetting track that CA is moving on currently and it scares me. Anti-semitism is re surging. We need to find ways to curb it, not promote it.
Thank you, Elisabeth Schwartz Borrego Springs, CA
