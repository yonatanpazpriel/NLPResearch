Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This curriculum teaches children to hate whites. It is horrendously bigoted, and proposes institutionalized racism, such as Affirmative Action. There is no discussion of brain size or IQ differences between the races, which are well supported by scientific research. East Asians have the highest brain to body ratio, and resulting IQ Aptitude and hard work, not racism is the cause of differences in outcome.
