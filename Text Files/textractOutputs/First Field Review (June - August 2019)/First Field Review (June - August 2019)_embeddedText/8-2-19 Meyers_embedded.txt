234: 4957 BDS has been identified as anti-Semitic by the US Congress, as well as by many states including California (see AB 2844). It meets the standard for anti-Semitism as adopted by the US State Department (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_test_of_antisemitism). Schools cannot teach anti-Semitism to students, nor can it hold up an anti-Semitic movement as an exemplar of something honorable. 237: 5030 Israel is an autonomous country and a member state of the United Nations. It is not called Israel-Palestine. This is factually incorrect. See https://www.un.org/en/member-states/#gotoI for a list of the names of members states of the United Nations.

Page 242: Lines 5157-5161 This is an incomplete and incorrect narrative. The curriculum refers to the war as " Palestine War," but its correct name is "Arab Israeli War." The cause of the war � the offensive attack on Israel by 4 Arab countries after the United Nations recognized the split of the region into Israel and Palestine � is ignored. It also eliminates all mention of the migration/expulsion of Jews from Arab countries in the region (about

700,000 Jews, equivalent to the number of Palestinians who left during the Arab Israeli War). The placing of blame on Jews and the elimination of any mention of the expulsion of Jews creates a biased and antiSemitic narrative.

Pages 264-9, in particular page 268 line 5802 and 269 line 5792: This is a political song about the Middle East. It has nothing to do with the treatment of Arab Americans or Muslims in the United States, nor does it have to do with the stated Content and Language Objectives in this lesson. It's the political opinion of a Palestinian musician, and has no place in a public school class syllabus. In fact, the content of the lyrics would make Jewish students feel marginalized and shunned. Jews in the United States are the most targeting minority, with physical attacks on Jews increasing dramatically across the United States. There are more hate crimes against Jews in California than any other minority, with an increase of 21% in anti-Semitic hate crimes in 2018 (https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-jewish-latino-hate-crimereport-20190703-story.html).
How is it possible, then, that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does not mention Jews as a targeted minority at all? That it doesn't teach the full story of Jewish refugees escaping genocide and being turned away from the United States? That it doesn't mention the Jewish struggle for acceptance and the incessant and increasing anti-Semitism that exists in California?

What's even worse is that this curriculum teaches mistakes and eliminates facts about Israel and this will only serve to promote antiSemitism as a result. The elements of the curriculum listed above are anti-Semitic according to the definition adopted by both the United States and the European Union.

It is part of the stated mission and vision of the CDE that students "attain the highest level of academic knowledge" in a "wholesome learning environment." This high level of academic knowledge means a factually complete and unbiased, accurate curriculum that does not promote a specific biased political point of view. A wholesome learning environment is one in which all students' religions and races are honored and respected, and none, including Jewish students, are marginalized because of what they believe and they are.
