The proposed curriculum is dangerously incomplete and unjust in the following ways: 1) the program fails to include ANTI-SEMITISM (one of the oldest hateful ideologies in history!) in its discussions of -isms and -phobias that impact the lives of ethnic groups in America (only using the word "anti-Semitism" in a single bullet point about "The intersectionality...of social oppression in the United States, including anti-Semitism and anti-Arabism, adultism, ageism...."); 2) the program includes anti-Israel/anti-Semitic political rhetoric from Palestinian activists (in sections about "BDS" and "Free Palestine") that have nothing to do with education about AMERICAN ethnicity and are utterly irrelevant as well as politically divisive; and 3) the curriculum excludes JewishAmericans from discussions of ethnic groups subject to continual hate crimes and threats from white supremacists, and also overlooks the discrimination that American Jews face in mere public policies (e.g., school calendars that ignore Jewish holidays). The omission of American Jewish ethnic issues in lessons about marginalized minorities in this Christian-centered nation is a shocking oversight.
For those who might object that American Jews are predominantly white and have fewer first-generation Americans than other marginalized minorities, I must point out the significant populations of Latinx and Iranian Jews in San Diego alone, and that Jews, like our Muslim "religious cousins," also comprise many cultures and races.

Furthermore, as the daughter-in-law and granddaughter of Jews who were driven out of Europe after years of persecution and torture at the hands of white supremacists, I know how essential education is to stop the tide of hatred that is overcoming our young people in America. Biased education is antithetical to peaceful coexistence!
Your glossary does not include "anti-Semitism" (p. 2), but lists "BDS" a non-American political movement, and continues to suggest discussions of Palestinian issues, irrelevant to life as American Arabs and/or Muslims. I noted numerous uses of the misnomers "Israel-Palestine" and "Palestine-Israel," neither of which is an accurate country name. The pages I refer to include: pp. 2,234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269.
