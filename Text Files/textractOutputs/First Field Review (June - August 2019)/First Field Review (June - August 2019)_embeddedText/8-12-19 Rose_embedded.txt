To Whom it May Concern on the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:
I have been an educator for the past forty years, teaching students from pre-school to university level. I have done this work all my life because I know the power and importance of education and teaching, in order to support individuals to gain the ability to seek information, and understand what they find.
I know the importance of making sure courses that are taught are unbiased, especially in a time where "alternative facts" are considered a real thing.
That is why I am particularly upset by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, which is unfortunately imbalanced and thus intrinsically flawed.
While I absolutely support the teaching of ethnic studies classes, I urge you to make the necessary revisions to this curriculum to keep it from encouraging anti-semitism, even if that is not its intent. A curriculum that fails to mention the American Jewish experience or antisemitism, and singles out Israel for criticism, will allow for the institutionalization of teaching antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools. This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America, and especially on college campuses.
There have been specific recommendations made by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha, and others towards improving the balance and removing the bias.
Some examples of the problems with the ESMC include:
� ESMC focuses heavily on power structures and forms of oppression including white supremacy, sexism, classism, Islamophobia, transphobia -- but excludes anti-Semitism.
� Anti-Jewish bias receives only a passing mention during a discussion of intersectionality in a proposed course on Pacific Islander studies. The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism.
� A 22-page glossary and bibliography has entries for Islamophobia and racism, but none for antiSemitism.
� Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America, which is poor teaching and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.

In my teaching experience, I have worked with many diverse communities. I have taught children and young adults who have never met a Jewish person before, and who had no idea what being Jewish meant. For these young people to be taught a false representation of Judaism can only harm each and every one of them, ultimately, as well as creating greater global divisions.
As educators, our work is to help people find a way to communicate, with open hearts and minds. That is why a fair and balanced ethnic studies curriculum is essential. I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Please do not use your positions to create further ignorance and deeper rifts in our society.
Thank you, Dey Rose
