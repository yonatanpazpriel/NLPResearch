Focusing primarily on Cambodian American males makes the plight of Cambodian American females invisible. Unless statistics show that only Cambodia American men have been deported, please consider adding information that includes Cambodian American females as well. Lines 3955 � 3956

While this definition of Cambodia is an important distinction, please add more to the definition so that students do not simply remember Cambodia as the country "that got caught in the Vietnam War due to the secret bombings." While this is very much true, Cambodia should not be primarily defined by its involvement in the Vietnam War and the bombings. A neutral definition would include the location of Cambodia (such as bordering Vietnam and Laos, etc.). A broader but more politically charged definition would include the Khmer Rouge genocide. However, this type of definition is to be taken with caution as we do not want to continue associating a country with its past trauma.

Check the spelling of Pol Pot. In addition, the Khmer Rouge should not specifically be defined as a staff of youth and child soldiers. There were adults that participated in the Khmer Rouge as soldiers and murderers as well. A more inclusive definition with adults would be applicable here. Lines 3742 � 3745

Singling out students based on their racial/ethnic identity is insensitive and may present an unwanted spotlight on students. Instead, open up with a general question, such as "Would anyone like to share anything they know about Hmong culture or background from personal experience or interaction?" Even then, this question can still be somewhat problematic and it may be better to remove this question completely.

This reasoning is similar to why we never ask "Who is Jewish?" when learning about the Holocaust in class.
