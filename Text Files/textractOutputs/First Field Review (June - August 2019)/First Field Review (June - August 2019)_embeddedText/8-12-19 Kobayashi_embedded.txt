From: Ruth Kobayashi Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 4:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good day and thank you for your important work for our students.
I urge you to avoid content that makes judgements on historical events or historical figures-include all sides of controversial events or figures. Please avoid using terms that minimize any group....minority or otherwise. Finally, please use complete facts when describing movements like BDS and take the anti Israel bias out of this section.
Finally, please include the significance of anti-semitism and it's ties to the holocaust in the curriculum. Anything less will demonstrate that those who approve this curriculum care little for the Jewish people.
Let's not produce a curriculum that polarizes along ethnic or political lines. Let's do better. Our kids deserve it.
Respectfully,
Ruth Sanchez Kobayashi Parent of two college students-graduates of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District
