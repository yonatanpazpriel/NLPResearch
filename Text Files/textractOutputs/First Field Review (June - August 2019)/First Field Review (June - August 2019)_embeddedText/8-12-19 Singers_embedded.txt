From: JOY SINGERS Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 2:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: AB331 Bibliography Reference
At the suggestion and assistance of the local Dept of Education, through Superintendent, I attempted to make public comment on the AB331 proposed curriculum. I am not able to fill in the public form.
I was able only to find definition of BDS, but without source material referencing the content. Please provide name of Source material for course study.
I have lived in Israel many times and in the Shomron community of Ariel. I held an Israeli Press Certificate, arranged interviews with live weekly radio broadcasts to the States. I am not Jewish.
As then, I am now deeply concerned that "thought-shaping based upon facts" not onefaceted bias and emotion be the standard. The BDS movement and its spread of antiIsrael bias and its dissemination to high school/college kids is gravely concerning to me.
