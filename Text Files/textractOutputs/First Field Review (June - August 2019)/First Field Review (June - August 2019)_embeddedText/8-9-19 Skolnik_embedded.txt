From: Bonnie Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 4:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Correction Needed
Please correct the ethnic studies proposed curriculum to include an honest, just history of the Jewish people.
While some, indeed many, may disagree with the contemporary leadership & politics of Israel - let California not sacrifice the historic accuracy of Jewish scapegoating & prejudice throughout the centuries - to the pedestal of ethnic studies.
There are respected historians I can recommend, if your committee has a dearth of resources.
