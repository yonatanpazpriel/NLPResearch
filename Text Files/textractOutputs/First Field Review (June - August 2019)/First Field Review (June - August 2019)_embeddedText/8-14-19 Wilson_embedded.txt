From: DJ Wilson Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Classes
Hello, after reading about the content proposed in the new ethnic studies classes which all high school and college students will be required to complete, I am compelled to voice my disapproval. My wife and I have four students currently enrolled in the San Diego Unified School District.
Please understand that should these proposed classes become part of the mandated curriculum, without any parental consent nor option for parents to opt out of participation, we will be compelled to remove our children from the district and seek alternate forms of education (homeschooling, charter school, etc).
Given that many like-minded parents will, perhaps, leave the district as well, and that much of district funding is correlated to pupil count, the district stands to lose much of its funding.
I ask that the proposed ethnic studies classes be removed and not approved.
Thank you for time and consideration, Darrin Wilson
