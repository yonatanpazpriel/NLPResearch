From: Yigal Dakar Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission, California Department of Education, and State Board of Education:
I am writing as a member of the Los Angeles Jewish community and a member of Sinai Temple as well as Congregation B'nai David-Judea. While I do commend Board of Education for mandating a new Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California's High Schools, I feel that the proposed curriculum is misleading at best, and potentially divisive to our already splintering community. The draft under consideration is likely to aggravate and amplify the voices of AntiSemitism and anti-Israel sentiment. The Israeli-Palestinian issue is nuanced and complex, and should be addressed and taught as such. Similarly, endorsement of the BDS movement, which is rooted in the philosophy that the State of Israel simply shouldn't exist, is an implicit legitimization of Anti-Semitism, as it sanctions the claim that the Jewish people has no right to a state of its own.
The current curriculum is unacceptably flawed, and will result in the opposite of the intended result. I hope that you will allow additional time and consideration as well feedback from our community in the reexamining and drafting of a new plan.
Respectfully submitted, Yigal Dakar
