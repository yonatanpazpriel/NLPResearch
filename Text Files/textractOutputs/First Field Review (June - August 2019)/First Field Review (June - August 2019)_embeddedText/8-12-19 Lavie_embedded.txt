From: Liron Lavie Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 6:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum complaint
As a parent to children in the CA public system, I was devastated to hear about the new ethnic studies curriculum proposed by our department of education.
Teaching ethnic studies is a wonderful idea in my opinion. Teaching about different minorities, their struggles, contributions and so forth. Teaching about diversity and acceptance.
HOWEVER -
The curriculum proposed is offensive and excludes American Jews completely, at a time that antisemitism is at an all time high. AND promoting an antisemitic organization at the same time.
