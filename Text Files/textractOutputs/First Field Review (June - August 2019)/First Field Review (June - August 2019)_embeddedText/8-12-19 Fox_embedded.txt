Page 234 / Lines 4956, 4957 and 4958 � These three topics: 1) Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter, 2) Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel and 3) Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico stand in disturbing contrast to the other topics listed. Direct Action Front for Palestine and the call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel are movements with activist agendas against the State of Israel. Should California's school curricula promote student research of such one-sided and biased movements? Absolutely not! Otherwise, white nationalist, anti-immigration and anti-semitic movements could likewise be included (not to mention correlated websites such as 8chan, Breitbart News, etc.). The third topic explicitly calls Palestine a country, like Mexico. That is inaccurate and biased. It states a falsehood as an a priori fact. Lies should have no place in California's school curricula. All three topics should be removed.

Page 237 / Line 5030 and Page 241 / Line 5138 � The references to IsraelPalestine and Palestine/Israel are misleading and incorrect. The country name is Israel and should be referred to as such. The conflation of Israel and Palestine is provocative and biased. While it alludes to the longstanding conflict in the region, it has no place in the stated objectives of the curriculum (i.e., the Arab-American experience in America). That could well be a different curriculum, but it's inappropriate in this curriculum.
