I am a lifelong resident of California and have been paying taxes in California for almost 50 years. I graduated from various schools in California, I own a home and a business. I believe I know what children need to learn in order to be successful. We are graduating too many students from high school in California who lack basic literacy and math skills. The new push toward "ethnic studies" will do nothing to correct these deficiencies. And in most districts, the new ethnic studies curriculum will crowd out other subjects that are most likely more useful. Please do not make ethnic studies mandatory in California. Thank you in advance for your consideration. Best wishes, Gregory Gandrud
