As a retired high school English teacher, I am very concerned about California's proposed new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I am very supportive of the idea of an Ethnic Studies program for high school students, but a successful program must be accurate, balanced and inclusive; unfortunately the proposed program has none of the above attributes. The most obvious example of the lack of inclusion is the failure to include anti-semitism in the curriculum, despite the fact that anti-semitism is the most prevalent religious hate crime in America.
The BDS movement is not only the longest entry in the Glossary, and Anti-Semitism is not even mentioned, but the BDS entry is neither accurate nor balanced. Furthermore, since "The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel." (Asad AbuKalil, Professor of Political Science and BDS leader at the University of California), it has no purpose in a California curriculum for Ethnic Studies.
Personally, I find the bias of the document offensive. If I were still teaching, I could not use such a curriculum in my classroom, especially if the students were as diverse as my students have been. The tone of the classrom should be positive, rather than one that supports exclusion and hate.
The current ESMC needs a very significant rewrite, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Thank you, Nancy S. Fogel Stanford, CA
