No wonder kids are so weak and pathetic today teaching this type of crap. Everyone has the opportunity to succeed if the effort is put in and the MOTHER AND FATHER are engaged in their kids lives. There is male and female, right and wrong, good and bad, peronsal responsibility. Its not what you are but who you are, do you love or do you hate. Stop teaching hate and division and get back to the basics. If this country is so bad move to a better one, you are making things worse with this communist propaganda or is this your agenda? This is bad, you people are evil.
