From: Cathy Norman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: My comment re proposed model curriculum
I completely agree with Dr. Dan Boland, whose essay I have partially copied here. I believe the proposed curriculum is unspeakably abusive toward our precious children, traumatizing them, and grooming them to become victims. He speaks my mind more eloquently than I am able:

An Elder's Concern For Culture Corrupted
Our culture's fractious political rhetoric and our crude public discourse give abundant evidence that America is deeply wounded by our blithe dismissal of courtesy and our disdain for truth and civility.
We no longer use language merely to transmit logical ideas, to stimulate reasoned discussion or to clarify a befuddling situation. Words are now "weaponized" to demean and humiliate, to dredge unintended insult out of a casual dialogue, to label people as "haters" or "homophobes" or "hide-bound traditionalists."
Even the simplest facts are now fraught with accusatory inuendo. Incredibly, law suits result from the use of a politically incorrect word, even from a statement of one's religious beliefs.
Character assassination, assigning mean-spirited motives to others, verbal exaggeration and falsification, slander and calumny, and deliberate lies overflow from state and church. A credible public figure is hard to find, even in the once-hallowed precincts of political, educational and ecclesial governance.
The aggressive de-construction of our shared language and the malicious re-definition of words have swept America into a national morass of moral polarization, hastening the demise of common sense, respect for legal precedent -- and sanity.
What's Happened?
Underlying all of this in our culture are many concerning developments. Let us look at two: 1) the ascendance of untruth and deception as cultural norms, and 2) the profound distortion and misuse of human freedom; misuse which taints our nation to its roots.
First of all, it is almost trite to say that truth and facts have become expendable. Our culture plays a fast-and-loose game with words and meanings. Even foundational words such as "man" and

"woman," "husband" and "wife," are now banned by countless agencies, lest someone's newfound sensibilities be hurt. Centuries-old traditions and their sacred origins are dismissed ... because someone's feelings might be hurt?
Let the impact of that statement sink in for a moment.
The realities of male and female are now splintered into countless incoherent terms and jingoistic categories, including ominously-befogged references to cis-gender, skolio-sexuality and dozens of linguistically-excruciating sub-categories which obscure life's simplest facts. Our culture's present flirtation with gender-over-sex-identity (the idea that a man is really a woman simply if he wishes) leads us into profound moral chaos.
Worst of all is the grisly lie called "reassignment surgery," the result of which is an ongoing experiment with youth and a suicide rate twenty times higher than average.
Nature's truths are dismissed with pathological ease. Our culture's finer traditions are twisted beyond recognition ... and for what ...?
The Dismissal Of True Culture
The root meaning of "culture" is the Latin word "cultus," i.e., a spirit of awe and worship springing from our inherent sense of the sacred and the mystery of life itself.
Culture once meant regard for, and preservation of, the finer, more ennobling traditions and accomplishments of our race. It involved handing down to our children the best of our achievements and beliefs, wrested from error and arrogance throughout our history.
In America, our culture was originally based on our God-given freedom to meet our responsibilities as human beings without outside intrusion or force. This meant freedom to respect human and divine laws, to honor the nation's ideals, to summon the moral energy to improve our injustices, to afford each person opportunities for economic and personal security.
The history of America's traditions is actually the story of human nature seeking to achieve justice and goodness as the nation's motivating norms. It's all spelled out in the documents which define America's authentic, historic exceptionalism ... despite our past-President's public denial of our nation's true greatness and the growing movement to destroy America's identity and mission from within.
Today, our nation's traditions are readily trashed, our flag banned, our anthem despised. The sacred bases of true culture are denigrated in the bizarre whirl of America's suicidal tryst with politically correct nihilism.
We have created a fetid spiritual and psychological wasteland for our children. We hand them lies as our legacy. We create a grimly violent, sexually saturated, humanly distorted, factually

dismissive, self-indulgent, abortion-loving, God-denying "pop culture" in which even the sacred lives of our children are irrelevant ... and anything � anything � goes. ..."
