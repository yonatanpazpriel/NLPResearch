To the Cal. Dept. of Education / Instructional Quality Commission and Those This May Concern: I am a California resident with a Master's in Public Administration;
The proposed curriculum (ESMC), as it stands, is deeply disturbing. As a Jewish California, I am shocked by the anti-Semitic language, couched as anti-Israel rhetoric. The Department of Education should reconsider a course that promotes hatred and bias in our school system, especially since it targets children who do not have the knowledge to understand the bias. The Jews of California should not be targeted in a way that would be unthinkable for other ethnicities. As someone who has a background in Public Administration, I know that this is something that would sincerely damage our school system for years to come. This is a choice that could demonstrate that being antiSemitic is a good option.
I appreciate your consideration. I encourage you to contact me if there is anything I can clarify. Best regards, Isaac H. Winer, Esq. California resident for 34 years Parent of public high school student
