August 14, 2019
While it is good and imperative for us all to know our backgrounds and know each other, this draft seems to miss the mark.
Jewish Americans have a hxstory here as well and that is not addressed. Anti-Semitism is not discussed. The BDS movement has no place in this curriculum. It is an international issue!
I hope that you will take another look at the ideas contained in the program and can make some appropriate changes.
