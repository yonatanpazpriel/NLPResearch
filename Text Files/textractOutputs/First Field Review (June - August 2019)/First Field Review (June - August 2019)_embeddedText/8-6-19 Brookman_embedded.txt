From: Jackie Brookman Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 12:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Stop Conservative Attack on Ethnic Studies and Arab Community Curriculum
As a concerned member of the Jewish community I support Ethnic Studies in California public high schools, including curriculum that the Arab American community believes to be important. It is critical that students learn about issues of race, class and gender. The benefits of Ethnic Studies have been well documented including better student academic performance, and higher graduation and college enrollment rates.
