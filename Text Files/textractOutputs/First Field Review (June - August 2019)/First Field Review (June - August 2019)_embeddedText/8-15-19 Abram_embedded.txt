From: Deborah Abram Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 6:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Deborah Abram Subject: Curriculum
Dear Committee, As a former Los Angeles Unified School District teacher and a current high school tutor, I am surprised
and disappointed that there is no mention of the Jewish experience in the United States, antisemitism, Jewish participation in the fight for civil rights, or the Holocaust. I also find the definition and inclusion of the BDS movement both anti-Israel, one-sided, and anti-Semitic. Ethnic studies is extremely important for students of all backgrounds and ethnicities. It should include a history of marginalized peoples in the United States and all of the contributions marginalized people have made to our country. I refer you to the excellent ethnic studies class at California State Northridge. The pages I take offense to are pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269. Thank you for encouraging community input. Deborah Abram
