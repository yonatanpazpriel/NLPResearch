Hello,
I'm the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, and I can tell you first hand what an impact my Mother's story and life has had on me and my family, both negatively and positively.
However, this issue is not about me, but the millions of Jews who lost their lives due to hatred, and intolerance, and which continues today, where anti-Semitism exists in a very strong way.
It is extremely important that kids of all races and genders be informed of the hatred, intolerance, and misguided acts of the past be condemned forever and instead study, dialogue, and communicate how to correct, move forward and work together to create a society of togetherness, patience and understanding for each other for today, tomorrow, and throughout the coming ages.
Kids need to be informed about all races and religions, and practices, so they may form their own opinions, lifestyles and create a more wholesome world.
Thank you, Susan Wohl
