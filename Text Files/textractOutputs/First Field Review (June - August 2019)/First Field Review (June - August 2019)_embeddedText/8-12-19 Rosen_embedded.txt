From: Harris Rosen Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 9:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Anti-Semitic Curriculum
I am alarmed at the proposed High School curriculum that promotes BDS and anti-Israel sentiments. The BDS movement is one that claims to be for human rights, but in promoting this supposed cause, it singles out the only Jewish country for biased and targeted claims. It issues no call to boycott the numerous countries engaged in human rights violations, institutionalized discrimination against women and minorities, torture, lack of freedoms and other blatant infringements of human rights.
So why is it that Israel, a country founded and governed by law, is singled out. You can explore a number of reasons, but the only one that really makes sense is that the anti-Semites on the Left and the Right, the Muslim countries, and other misguided and misinformed individuals want to promote the annihilation of the Jewish state.
That California would be willing participant in disseminating anti-Semitic hate speech in the name of education is deplorable and only promotes a future generation of Jew haters. In this world full of hatred and bias, California cannot be part of the problem.
Accordingly, you must revise your prosed program to eliminate the bias and one-sided presentation of the Middle East, so the next generation can be informed of facts and not hate.
