I am deeply concerned with the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and it's anti-Jewish bias. The Jewish community and their history in the US should be taught alongside the other ethnic groups listed in the curriculum (including Arab Americans). Anti-Semitism is a serious issue in the US today and this curriculum in it's current form omits the Jewish experience entirely and unfairly singles out Israel for criticism.

Glossary

I do not find it appropriate to include Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) in the glossary (line 30) nor anywhere in the curriculum. Not only has the BDS movement been proven as thinly veiled anti-Semitism but the bias shown through it's inclusion in the curriculum is troubling. Including BDS in the curriculum (and the corresponding definition) presents an over-simplified onesided viewpoint on what is an extremely complex topic. The glossary fails to define apartheid, although it is used in the BDS definition, as well as antiSemitism. I strongly believe that bigotry and bias should be included in the glossary as they are both very relevant when discussing ethnic history (BDS is the only "B" term in the glossary).
