While the concept of including historical information about various forms of discrimination, globally and in the US is important for high school students to learn, the curriculum in this May 2019 Draft creates MORE discrimination and reads as politically motivated as well as too focused the negatives in those times/events. It pits one group against another and the student has to decide where they fit. History in this course is NOT presented in context for these issues of discrimination. Because you don't like what occurred or the results doesn't mean it didn't happen. But it is important to know why it happened. And, therefore what lessons are missed are the teachable moments about balance, context of what else was occurring in the world, country, region that influenced the various ethnicities or groups of participants and the surrounding societies/communities. These topics you include in this course should be part of a broader study of history. Even calling it "Ethnic Studies" further polarizes folks, causes students and teachers to call up in their mind events that are often displayed out of context. Focus instead on the core issues of how folks of different values, experiences and goals can work together by understanding each other and communicating to better work together for common good, or to instead NOT be obstructionists or agitators for what might become only selfserving interests. It appears the goal of this course is to make the decision for students what is/was wrong. So, this becomes a course in someone's sense of morality or political correctness. Groups are labeled and politicized rather than identifying that it may in fact be individuals who may be of the same ethnicity, nationality, economic or social background. DO NOT MAKE SUCH A COURSE MANDATORY, and certainly do not let this Model be any part if a history course alone. Rather, report as history what took place, where, when and by whom, for what reason and the consequences of those events. This curriculum does not meet the minimum standard for a history study. Help students, in a real history course, learn how to separate fact from fiction. Help them learn about prejudice and politics as part of social studies courses.
