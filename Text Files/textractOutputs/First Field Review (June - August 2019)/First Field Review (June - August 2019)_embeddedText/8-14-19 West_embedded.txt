My name is Desiree West and I am firmly against implementing any curriculum on ethics, gender, or LGBTQ in our schools. It is not your job as a state to teach this to my child. It is not your place to pose your propaganda in our public school. Stick to what our children need reading, writing, mathematics and art/sports. That is the states place not teaching ethics. That is my job as the parent. I AM FIRMLY OPPOSED TO THE ETHICS STUDIES CURRICULUM BEING IMPLEMENTED IN PUBLIC STATE FUNDED SCHOOLS.
Thank you Desiree West
