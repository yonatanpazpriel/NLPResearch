Glossary Catherine Todd

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Glossary is extremely negatively judgmental. Rather than providing information in a neutral format, the author used language that is narrowly, and in some case, personally defined and meant to persuade to a particular viewpoint rather than allowing the reader to use the information to come to his/her own conclusion(s). Education is intended to provide all information and viewpoints, to encourage healthy discussion and allow the individual to form their own beliefs/opinions.
