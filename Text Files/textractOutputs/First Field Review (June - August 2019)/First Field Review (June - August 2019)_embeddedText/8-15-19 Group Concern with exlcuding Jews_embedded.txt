Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I used to live in California, and although I don't anymore, I have seen California set a precedent that can have repercussions elsewhere. I am very concerned about the curriculum as it stands now.
I think it would be a serious error to exclude Jews from those listed as oppressed groups that are featured in this curriculum. Jews endured the largest genocide of the 20th century and have been the largest religious group to experience bias and hate crimes based on religion in the last 3 years (according to FBI statistics). I am also under the impression that this curriculum includes anti-Semitic tropes, one-sided BDS bias, and demonization of Israel. The Jewish people have a right to self-determination, just as Palestinians and all other people do. To deny the Jews a right to a state of their own is anti-Semitic and just plain wrong.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
