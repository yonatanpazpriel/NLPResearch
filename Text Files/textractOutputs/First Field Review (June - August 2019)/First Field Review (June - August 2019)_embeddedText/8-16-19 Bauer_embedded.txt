Your inclusion of an Arab American studies section contains references to Palestine/Israel. Israel happens to be the only Jewish nation in the world. The country is called Israel. Not Israel-Palestine, not Palestine/Israel. There are 22 Arab countries in the world. There are far more acts of violence and intimidation against Jews than Arabs. Your one sited text is dangerous and further fuels anti-Semitic propaganda. This course is clearly written by biased, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic people. You should be ashamed of yourselves. Further the BDS movement is led by people who are on record as wanting the destruction of Israel. It is clearly a biased, political organization. To have it glorified and normalized in a public school text book is a dereliction of unbiased public education. This is overall appalling and biased. Shame on you.

The content below appears to be that of opinion, not historical fact. To treat African-American people as victims that are hopeless pawns to "the system" does not serve African-Americans nor anyone else. This type of opinion as fact curriculum is irresponsible.

Content and Language Objectives:

1. Years after slavery, many African-Americans continue to live in poverty because of racist, discriminatory laws.

2. Institutions exist that keep people of color in positions of disadvantage despite of the narrative of equality for all.
