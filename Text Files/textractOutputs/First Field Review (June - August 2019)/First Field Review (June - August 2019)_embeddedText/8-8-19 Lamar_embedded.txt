"critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy,cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society;" is biased at best (WOW) and needs to be taught as a bias, not as a profound truth or the basis of our society. Students need to look critically at all aspects of knowledge and culture and be able to form independent and informed opinions for themselves. Students should not be taught what to think, but HOW. For example : What are the down sides of social justice? Please revise this as it appears to be about telling students what to think than helping them learn how to think.
