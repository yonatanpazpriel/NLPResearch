Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2 lines 30-40: Arab citizens of Israel are allowed to vote, and Arabs are members of Israel's parliament and its Supreme Court, so claims that Israel is an apartheid country are simply false. The ultimate goal of BDS is to destroy Israel, and including one-sided, anti-Israel BDS propaganda in the model curriculum is not appropriate. Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269, like the glossary, are tendentious, unequivocally condemning Israel without even attempting to present any contrasting viewpoint. This presentation is biased and distorted.
