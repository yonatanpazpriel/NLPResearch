I am requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel (and anti-Jewish) bias from the model curriculum. I believe strongly in the value of inclusion. BDS promotes hate and division. I view it as part of the growing acceptance � on the left and the right � of anti-Jewish sentiment.

Please add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. There is a sizable population of Middle Eastern Jews living in California. Arab nationalism and Muslim fundamentalism resulted in the local populations and governments driving Jews from their homes in places like Iran, Iraq, and Syria to the United States. Omission of their experiences is a troubling oversight.

Glossary and Bibliography

Page 2, lines 30-40. The description of BDS is inaccurate, misleading, and heavily biased. It's not even clear to me why BDS is relevant for California ethnic studies curriculum. I'm not aware of any other arguably ethnic disputes in other countries that are covered in this curriculum or references to organizations that support one side or another.

Page 234, line 4957. This topic promotes anti-Jewish sentiment under the guise of anti-Israel sentiment. It is biased because it singles out the only Jewish state and lacks any reference to the rights given to Arabs and other ethnic minorities, to women, the democratic process, the free press, etc., that exist in Israel and which differentiate it from other Middle Eastern countries.

Arab American Studies Course Outline

Page 237, lines 5024-5032. The curriculum refers to Israel-Palestine as an Arab country. Israel is a Jewish state with a large Arab population. It would be worth noting that there is co-existence and legal rights provided to Jews and Arabs in Israel that do not exist in any Arab country.

THE HISTORY OF ARAB IMMIGRATION TO THE UNITED STATES FURTHER RESOURCES

Page 242, lines 5154-5163. One would never know from reading this description that it was the surrounding Arab countries, not the new State of Israel, that declared war and invaded. Israel accepted the UN partition. I have never heard of the Israel War of Independence referred to as the Palestine War.
Sample Course Models, page 256, lines 5477-5494. This sample course is a good example of the one-sided view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It also appears designed to attract students to the Palestinian argument � or at least a narrow portion of it � but framing the position as one that is consistent with hiphop and popular musicians. Why the committee selected Shadia Mansour in particular, who used an anti-Semitic slur in her lyrics (and has made similar statements outside of her songs), is troubling. Moreover, to the best of my knowledge, neither Shadia Mansour nor Ana Tijoux are part of the "ArabAmerican Settlement" which is the title of the chapter.

Pages 264-269. Largely the same as above. It is ironic that Israel is being associated with an empire when it is the only country in the region that has never sought to be an empire. (Line 5700 and 5769.) It is also concerning that the song accuses the only country in the Middle East with a free press of not having one "They [Israelis] use the press so they can manufacture." Line 5735 and 5803-5804). The line could also be interpreted as Jews controlling the press in places like the United States or Britain.
