From: Martin Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 8:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Critique and Opposition
Dear Dept of Education,
After a cursory review of the Ethnic Studies proposed material, I quickly found a cursory a review was all that was needed to see that this content is highly offensive and politicially skewed. If you want to indoctrinate our children, this is how you'd do it. For instance, attacking capitalism should not be included in curriculum as an "ethnic" issue; furthermore a free market fundamental to our American economy and way of life. So while it is fine to to have critical discussion about these issues I keep thinking about the youngest audience of this curriculum who should be focused on learning the basics arithmetic and not undermining the fundamentals of what it means to be an American.
Finally, I am concerned about the message you will be sending to my to my daughters who are all white. I am not naive as to the history of what has happened in history nor do I want to hide it from my children. But I am concerned that the way this material is presented has an effect that engenders undue guilt and shame on innocent children; "white guilt" is a term I've heard before and something I would want me children to feel. Because they have done nothing wrong.
Thank you,
David Martin
