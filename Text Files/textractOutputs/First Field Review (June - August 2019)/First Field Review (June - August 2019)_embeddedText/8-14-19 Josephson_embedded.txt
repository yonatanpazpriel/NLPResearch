Where are the sections on Israel, Jews and the Hebrew religion? Where are their contributions to medicine, technology, music, and the arts displayed? How could such a small group of people win so many Nobel Awards? How did the BD&S group get their views in against Israel? The Palestinians who left Israel in 1948 were ordered to do so by Egypt, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. These Arab countries caused their own NAKBA when they tried to kill all the Jews and erase the state of Israel. If I remember correctly, a few thousand Israelis defeated a few million Arabs.
