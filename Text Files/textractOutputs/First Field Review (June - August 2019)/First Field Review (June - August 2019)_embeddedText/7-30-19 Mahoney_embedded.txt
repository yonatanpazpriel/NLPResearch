Lets be careful with what we teach our kids. Capitalism is neither racist nor white supremacy . It does however allow the `American Dream' to happen in which students grow up to be taxpayers who pay the salaries of those coming up with this ` curriculum' . We should encourage change for sure, but do so teaching objective history, not some ideological version of past events. Ethnic studies need not be fertile ground for classism nor encouraging Us vs Them.
