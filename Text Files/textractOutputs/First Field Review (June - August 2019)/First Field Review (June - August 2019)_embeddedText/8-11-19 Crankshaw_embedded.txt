Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am pleased to see that California is making a serious and systematic effort to teach our children about the variety of ethnic experiences in our state and to coach them to cultivate more inclusive attitudes. However, I'm concerned that the curriculum almost entirely leaves out the experience of Jewish Californians. This oversight has created an unbalanced curriculum, especially since anti-semitism is on the rise on our college campuses.
I'm writing to encourage you to rewrite the curriculum consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a person who was born in California, who embraced the Jewish community, who converted to Judaism at age 50 and who then had to explain anti-semitism to my children, it pains me to see the Jewish experience left out of your curriculum.
As a Californian who whole-heartedly supports efforts to improve relations between Muslim-Americans and Jewish-Americans in my community, I believe this curriculum undercuts the efforts of my Jewish friends and my Muslim friends.
Please make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
David Crankshaw Menlo Park, California
