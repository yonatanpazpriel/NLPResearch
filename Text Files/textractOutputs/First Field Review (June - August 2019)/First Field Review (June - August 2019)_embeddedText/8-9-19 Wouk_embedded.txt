From: Nina Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:59 PM To: CFIRD Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
California needs a revised ethnic studies curriculum. It also needs clear standards in order to prevent any state sponsored educational materials from being used for political purposes, or to incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Nina Wouk
