The goal of Ethnic Studies should be to promote tolerance, not hate. By incorporating antisemitic language and promoting BDS, a movement that seeks the elimination of a country, this curriculum promotes prejudice. Please change
the curriculum to promote tolerance. BDS should be labeled as an
antisemitic hate group.
