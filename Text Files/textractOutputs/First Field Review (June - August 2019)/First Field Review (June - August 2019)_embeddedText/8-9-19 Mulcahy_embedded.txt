Too much jargon from academic and politically-slanted activism (e.g., cisheteropatriarchy, hxtory). Page 3, 54-58 Does not meet the goal of teaching to the needs of some students of Jewish and Israeli origin because it blatantly delegitimizes their ethnicity's right to a movement of national liberation, sovereignty and freedom.

Page 6, 143-147 The proposed curriculum will violate its own principles as defined here. For Jewish students, it will not tend to build their "Identity & Socioemotional Development". If adopted as proposed, it will increase stereotype threat, weaken Jewish students' sense of identity, impart negative images of their history and ancestral origins, and add emotional anxiety about being welcomed in a multi-cultural America.

It will tend to make American Jewish students feel negatively about themselves as a minority with a history of oppression who has embraced American values of diversity, middle class professionalism, education, and civic participation.

It promotes a negative image of Jews as oppressors, powerful members of a white majority, which is completely counter-factual.

It demonizes Jewish participation in professions, government, media, arts & sciences by not explaining cultural contexts, sociology within the Jewish community, or factual history.

Not politically and academically neutral. It appears to be impossible to teach this curriculum without taking a political side. Therefore, many schools will prefer to not teach it, contributing to a deeper divisive political culture in our society. All students need basic social and cultural history and facts to debate and vote coherently. Anti-Semitism is not included as a concept; worldwide Jewish history is not acknowledged; American Jewish history is not taught.

This curriculum represents a possible violation of the Civil Rights of Jewish students: In its anti-Israel bias and pro-BDS statements, the curriculum misrepresents Jewish ancestral roots and national identity as a religion, ethnicity, and peoplehood. Also may violate civil rights of Israeli-American students in their national identity. Completely missing are Sample Course Models for lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including: waves of immigration, starting in dispersion from Spain during 1500's; Sephardic Jews during American Revolution; Jewish role during Gold Rush; early 19th century German immigration; late 19th & early 20th century immigration from Eastern Europe (role of poverty, pogroms, forced conscription into armies); mid-20th century immigration from Middle East and Islamic countries. Some topics: Internal tensions between earlier waves of Jewish immigrants with their uncultured co-religionists from Eastern Europe; tensions about assimilation and "doing well in America" with keeping traditions; Jewish role in trade-union movement; contribution of Yiddish culture to theatre, music and other popular culture; role in post-WWII civil rights movements, Mississippi Summer & Cesar Chavez' farm labor movement (i.e., why historic oppression of Jews motivated them); survivors of German Nuremburg Laws & participation of these educated Jews in academia, science/humanities; survivors of Holocaust including Hasidim, settlement in New York; Syrian Jewish and other Mizrachi cultures; movement to free Soviet Jews; etc.

The topics listed here are not neutral; they need to be balanced with other perspectives:

� Anti-Arab and Muslim Violence (compare to global terrorism of the 1970's, Second Intifada against Israeli residents,

assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, etc.)

� Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter (compare to organizations like Anti-Defamation League and Southern Poverty Law Center who work against discrimination of all/any peoples; compare to Jewish-Black Relations Civil Rights movement of the 1960's; and Martin Luther King's positive attitude towards Israel, etc.)

� Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel (compare to pro-normalization peace efforts by Jews and Arabs.)

4, Page 1-2 Glossary Add a definition of "Anti-semitism". It is shocking that its roots are grounded in historical Christian Europe (Chaucer, Shakesp
and Islamic Middle East which often appear in literature and sociology (dhimmitude).

It is all the more essential because this is a time of rising worldwide antisemitic incidents and rhetoric in media and on colleg campuses.

Antisemtism needs to be defined as the "oldest hatred" and the model & template for treating minorities as "other".

Without this base, high school students will be missing fundamental tools of interpretation to much of history & literature.

Page 1-2 Eliminate political bias in definition of BDS. It is not a "social movement" to improve Palestinian rights and conditions. Rather, it seeks to eliminate Israel, as stated by its founder, Omar Barghouti. It actually discourages engagement and promotes "non-normalization" which reduces the prospec peace and compromise on the part of both parties. It is a call for the elimination of one, and only one, particular state in the world, Israel. It is implicitly violent in that it demonizes Israel as the only country that has no right to defend itself against violence. BDS continues a long history of boycotting Jewish businesses and academics in both Europe and Islamic countries. This definition's use of the loaded and inaccurate term of "apartheid" does not distinguish between Arab citizens of Israel (wh have full rights in all sectors) and residents of a future state of Palestine. It does not explain that some restrictions against no citizen Palestinians are the result of multi-year Intifadas, bombings, car rammings and stabbings -- many of which are prooted Palestinian Authority leadership. It does not explain the role of various factions of Palestinians (e.g., Hamas) in encouraging violence against Israelis. BDS is used as an excuse to propagandize against Israel and Jews. It goes against academic, scientific, and cultural freedo It is unethical to call for a boycott of pop stars traveling to Israel and not acknowledge the global benefits of Israeli water technology medicine, and computer technology which is needed in California and the rest of the world. This definition does not acknowledge the negative effects of the BDS campaign in promoting a climate of stereotyping, discrimination, and anti-semitism in academia and on the political left.
