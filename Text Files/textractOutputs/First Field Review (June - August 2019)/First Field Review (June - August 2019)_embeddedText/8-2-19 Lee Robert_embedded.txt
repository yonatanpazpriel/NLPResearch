Educator's job is to teach facts, not indoctrinate. Anyone who has the ability to critically analyze the slanted information you wish to present to youth is criminal. Any enlightened, educated, sane person who has studied the death and devastation wreaked upon humanity by Socialist Marxists in the last century and still touts it over our Capitalist economy, is someone who should have their educator's credentials revoked. Teach real problem solving skills with critical thinking or are you afraid of losing your fleeting sense of power of the real sovereign individuals. The political agenda is so obvious and so disgusting, the rest of other States are ready to let California go before we pay for your bankruptcy, both financial and lack of values the Founding Fathers instituted. You should read the plethora of genius ideas rather than shoving your perverse beliefs on the next generation. This is straight out of the marxist playbook, you not fooling anybody. Despicable... R.
