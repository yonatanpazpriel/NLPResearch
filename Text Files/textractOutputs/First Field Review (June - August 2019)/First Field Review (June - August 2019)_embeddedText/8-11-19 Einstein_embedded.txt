From: Stephen Einstein Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I laud the goals of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It is certainly important to inculcate in the students of California mutual understanding and empathy for the diverse populations that comprise our state.
However, I have serious reservations about certain portions of the Model:
1. The curriculum omits any discussion of Jews, East Indians, Hindus, Armenians, Greeks, and others who have made significant contributions to our state.
2. As a rabbi, I am especially concerned that the role played by Jews in California's history, politics, and culture receives no attention.
3. In light of the rising rate of anti-semitism, it is incredible that the curriculum does not address antisemitism directly.
4. The curriculum has a decidedly anti-Israel slant. Examples can be found in the Arab American Studies Outline on Page 234 (lines 4956, 4957, 4958) and Page 242 (lines 5157-61) and Pages 268-69 (lines 580203)
It is my fervent hope that these concerns will be positively resolved prior to the adoption of the curriculum.
Respectfully yours, Sje
