I fully support the presence of ethnic studies curricula � I think it's vital to have the histories of all peoples of California, especially those that have been traditionally under-represented, taught in public schools. It's all the more important, then, for me to outline two major issues that I see with the current model curriculum.
1. The curriculum is poorly written, with many incomplete sentences, ideologically laden and poorly defined terms (righteous, "made to constantly digest content", "But teachers need to be aware of some concerns when selecting resources." and many others), as well as circular /vague arguments. As a professor in the CSU system, I correct many of these mistakes in undergraduate writing and take points off for them in final papers. I worry about allowing people who do not write professionally to write curricula for our public schools.
2. The curriculum lumps multiple ideological clich�s into what claims to be an ethnic studies curriculum. It's a disservice to the communities this curriculum is trying to represent to lump "Capitalism, Colonialism, Imperialism, Patriarchy, White Supremacy, Heteronormativity, Institution, Privilege, Hierarchy, Hegemony, Power, Systemic, Oppression" together with the genuine complex, constructive, participatory stories of these communities. Most of these are propaganda terms that do not encourage critical thinking; they read like a textbook from the Soviet Union at the height of the cold war. I wonder whether the communities this curriculum is trying to support (e.g. the Hispanic and Asian-American communities) have agreed to be represented in connection with these ideologies. Though this, unlike the prior two concerns, is a more narrow issue, I am compelled to
comment that as a Jew, it frightens me that the only international political term that made it into a curriculum presumably focused on U.S. communities is BDS � the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement, as opposed to, let's say, a discussion of the conflict in Kashmir, movements to free Tibet, or dozens of other controversial political/activist movements around the world. BDS is highly controversial, and this curriculum does not give any room for discussion of both sides of this issues.
Overall, after reading through many sections of the curriculum, I feel strongly that it is divisive, poorly organized and poorly referenced. It is highly ideological and does not, as it claims, encourage critical thinking. The many communities of California deserve better.
