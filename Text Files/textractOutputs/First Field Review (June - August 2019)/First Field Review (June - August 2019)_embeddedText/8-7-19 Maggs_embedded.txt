I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that , "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teacher to...enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mention Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing Pg. 2 Lines 30--40 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions . Please remove entire section of the BDS movement from the glossary. Pg. 234 Lines 4947--4965 Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Pg. 237 Lines 5029-5030 Use of unclear language that implies "IsraelPalestine" as a whole is an Arab country. Pg. 242 Lines 5158--5161 Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives
