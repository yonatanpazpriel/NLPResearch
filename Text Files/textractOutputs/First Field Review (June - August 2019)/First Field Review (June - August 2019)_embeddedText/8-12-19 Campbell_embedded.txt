From: John Campbell Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnics Studies Model Curriculum
I believe that including courses on ethnic studies in California high schools is an admirable goal. However, I strongly urge the department to closely examine and revise the model curriculum that was prepared by the advisory panel. The goal of the curriculum should be on educating students on the various ethnic groups and cultures that make up our country and to encourage open discussions in the classroom. The current curriculum includes politically slanted or ideological viewpoints that do not clearly meet this goal.
