From: Monica Berhman Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Ethnic Studies curriculum
As a former educator, I was surprised to read over the new guidelines for implementation for ethnic studies. It seems to me that those on the committee are very biased against capitalism, and have made a concerted effort to paint it in negative terms. What is needed is a more fair vision of capitalism. Hasn't capitalism created more personal comfort and well-being in our country? Why should it be equated with racism (a very overused and hackneyed term, by the way!) and oppression? It seems the members of this committee are very extreme leftists who see the world only through their single-minded lenses. Why isn't the committee more evenly balanced? Or have we just given up on that in California?
Another thought: I'm always amused by this term "diversity" (also over-used!). Are we supposed to feel more inclusive when this term is used? It seems like it just puts everyone in their only little tribe and victim group. And the ones who claim they are being more "diverse" feel overly righteous that they're doing the best for everyone.
Where is the critical thinking and logic skills in this proposal. Or have we given up on that too? Seems like there's going to be a lot of indoctrination in single-minded thinking, activism, etc.
I can only hope that someone will see reason and have the common sense to modify these proposals!
