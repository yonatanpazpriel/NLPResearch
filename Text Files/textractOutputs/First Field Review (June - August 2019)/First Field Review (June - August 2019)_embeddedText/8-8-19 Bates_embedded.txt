From: Dennis Bates Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 1:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is to request that you do not approve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This is a biased model that has no place in the Department of Educaiton's curriculum offerings. The anti-semitism and anti-Israel bias should never be a part of what is offered by the state. Certainly balanced presentation of viewpoints is always welcome but not material as is contained in the ESMC.
I was born and raised in San Francisco and own a home in Monterey California. Please reject this ESMC as not fitting for the progressive state that I know and respect.
Thank you,
Dennis Bates Monterey, CA
