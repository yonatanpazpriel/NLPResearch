August 15, 2019
Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
I'm writing to you in my capacity as a parent of teenagers who have attended public school in California throughout their childhood, as well as a combined decade's long member of the elementary, middle and high school Site Councils of my children's schools.
While I support the goal of an ethnic studies course, I'm surprised, saddened, and extremely concerned at the lack of balanced content and critical thought contained in the draft. If my children turned in a paper that was so one-sided on complex issues such as the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, or discussed oppression and hate crimes without mentioning anti-semitism while at the same time including anti-semitic tropes, or suggested students join a group such as BDS, that is known to inspire hate that has led to violence against Jewish Americans, there is no way they would receive a passing grade.
As such, it's imperative that this draft undergo a major re-write. I also believe the commission should alter the composition of the members of the drafting team in order to accurately and fairly represent California's rich, diverse ethnic communities in an unbiased fashion, appreciating the distinct histories and cultures of the people who call California their home, while striving for the ultimate goal of open-mindedness, inclusivity and unity.
Sincerely,
Andrea Luskin Parent and Site Council Member Atherton, California
