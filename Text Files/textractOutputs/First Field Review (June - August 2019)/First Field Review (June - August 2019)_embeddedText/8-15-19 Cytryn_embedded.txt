From: Jeremy Cytryn Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concern over ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I wanted to write to express my utmost concern about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I wholeheartedly support the idea of an ethnic studies class, I am disturbed by the proposed content of the course and the clear anti-Israel bias present in large swaths of the curriculum as well as the relative absence of any pedagogy surrounding anti-Semitism.
I was lucky enough to grow up in a very inclusive and diverse community. Yet even so, people frequently assumed that because I am Jewish, my first allegiance always lies with Israel. I still find that I am often accused of dual loyalty, without ever so much as asking how I feel about Israel. Furthermore, since moving to San Francisco, I have personally experienced a rise in antisemitic slurs and gestures, largely because I wear a kippah publicly. I would hope that a course that purports to increase understanding and dialogue would give a more holistic and balanced understanding of anti-Semitism and the PalestinianIsraeli conflict, rather than just covering the conflict from a narrow lens and glossing over all historical context. I fear that indoctrinating children in one particular perspective will increase rather than decrease prejudice, stereotyping, and discrimination, the very things this class purports to try to ameliorate. Furthermore, I feel that to not include anything about the American Jewish perspective in the curriculum and the history of the Jews as a historically oppressed people who needed to find a place of selfdetermination after the horrors of the Holocaust does a disservice to our children and cheapens what could be a meaningful debate over a fraught and complex issue.
I urgently ask that you make major revisions or consider a rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to allay these concerns
Thank you for taking my concerns to heart and all the best,
Jeremy Cytryn
