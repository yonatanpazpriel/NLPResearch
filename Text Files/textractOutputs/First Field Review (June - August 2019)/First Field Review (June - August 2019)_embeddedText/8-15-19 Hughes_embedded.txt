From: Sheila Hughes Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 12:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Advancing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Greetings,
As Dean of the School of Liberal Arts at Saint Mary's College of California, I write to urge you to move forward with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, with appropriate revisions to ensure that it reflects the diverse ethnic communities comprising our state (such as Asian and Pacific Islander communities).
Ethnic Studies is a thriving academic interdisciplinary field. In just the past three years, at Saint Mary's, we have added a new ES major, seen enrollments grow, and hired a new tenured professor to direct our long-standing program. Ethnic Studies advances knowledge about human experience and social life across the disciplines, it inspires and informs social justice movements and social change, and it empowers students of all ethnic identities to claim their histories as well as their voices and places of belonging in educational institutions. Ethnic minority students who take ES courses, in particular, are more likely to persist because of this.
We at Saint Mary's are excited to see the progress of this new curriculum and look forward to it becoming a reality across the state. I urge you to make the further development and realization of this curriculum a top priority.
Thank you.
Sheila Hassell Hughes
Dean, School of Liberal Arts
