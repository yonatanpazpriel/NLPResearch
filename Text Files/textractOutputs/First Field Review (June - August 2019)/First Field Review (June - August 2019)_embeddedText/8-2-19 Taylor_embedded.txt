From: Sue Taylor Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 9:04 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft of new curriculum.
My name is Susan Taylor and I have general thoughts on the new curriculum. Chapter one goals state, "...empower students to be engaged socially and politically, enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism. In essence, Ethnic Studies helps improve the U.S. democracy by encouraging the participation of all students at all political, social, and economic levels."
The idea of appreciation of diversity and inclusion is a wonderful and positive idea. The next sentence immediately reverses this as it isolates these groups by saying that Caucasian's are bigots, hateful, and racist. The inclusivity is now shattered into the mindset of oppression and secularism.
It is vitally important that these young minds be proud of their country and eventual inclusivity of all races, even the Caucasian ones. they should be educated it is America's love of inclusivity which separates us from the world of terrorists and hate that is so pervasive in other countries. We should be teaching them that we are not those people, we are a part of a free and loving and inclusive world order.
Bottom line, we can mold our children into loving, compassionate people or we can poison them with an ideology that the only races worthwhile are the ones that exclude one race. We are teaching them hate and racist ideologies becoming the very thing we don't want in our world.
