To whom it may concern
You intend to push through demand for anti semitic curriculum!!! Have the Jews not contributed to California's success?
Why not make a valuable lesson in schools such as teaching the Holocaust. I was horrified to learn this is not part of curriculum for each student in school.
Are you pushing through items without reading? understanding the language? the consequences?
Must every legal resident leave this state in order to wake up the law makers & legislators of this state?
Why not teach harmony & TRUE fact history, instead of revisionist history?
How I wish someone in power reconsiders & reads what residents have to say.
Please do not answer with one of your boiler plate, mean nothing platitude letters.
