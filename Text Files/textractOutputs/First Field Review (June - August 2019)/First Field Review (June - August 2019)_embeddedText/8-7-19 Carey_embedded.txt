Thank you for welcoming public feedback on this curriculum.
I was a public school teacher in California for years.
I hope this curriculum will not be used in the schools as it will suppress free speech. It does not contribute to students' critical thinking skills. It is very clearly an agenda of indoctrination trying to be forced on the students.
Please remove this curriculum from the public schools and use materials that more appropriately address the issues from more than one side.
California trying to be so open minded that their intelligence spills out all over the place is not looking like education anymore. It looks like you are trying to force culture to become as you want it to be. You do not represent the population of California well at all.
