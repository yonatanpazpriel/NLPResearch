As a high school social studies teacher, I am extremely concerned about the new Ethnic Studies curriculum being introduced to California public schools. Although I am a liberal Democrat, I am also a strong supporter of Israel and I believe that much of the anti-Israel comments are often biased, unfair, and -- indeed -- anti-Semitic.

Secondly -- again as a liberal Democrat -- I follow the news carefully. One of my major concerns is how the moderate and left liberals have been hogtied by identity politics. During the 1960s I was a strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement, but now I am more concerned about the polarization of our political rhetoric and I feel that the constant emphasis on different "groups" is a misrepresentation of the majority, who identify as Americans, above all. We need to get back to the idea of a "melting pot" and not add fuel to the fire of political divisiveness.
