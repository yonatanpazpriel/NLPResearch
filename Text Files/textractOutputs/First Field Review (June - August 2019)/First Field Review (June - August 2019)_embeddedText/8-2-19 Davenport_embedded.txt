I oppose the curriculum as it is anti capitalist, and teaches our students to be ungrateful for the blessings we have as Californians and as Americans. Some of the "heroes" put forth are convicted murderers, and I object to the writings which seek to utilize propaganda and a one sided worldview to our students. This is not right. I am a taxpayer, and I oppose this curriculum.
