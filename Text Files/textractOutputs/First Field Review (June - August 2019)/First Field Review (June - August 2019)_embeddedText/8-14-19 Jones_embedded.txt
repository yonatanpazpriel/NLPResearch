Page 7, lines 175-177 defines a hate incident as an "act of bias against race..." that does "not meet the legal definition of a crime."

At the risk of having my comments dismissed as white fragility, it is my understanding that this entire subject of studies falls under this definition of hate incident; that is, that it is based upon a bias against a "race," namely the "white race." See page 15, lines 366-375, for an illustration of this: that "whiteness is much more than a racial identity marker,..[whiteness] can manifest as social, economic, political, and cultural..power. " A few lines later, we are informed white supremacy is manifested through these same systems of power. Thus whiteness is white supremacy. (cont.)

This is then antithetical to the stated purpose of this subject of studies as delineated on page 2, lines 50-52, which reads, "Ethnic Studies has created a space for all students to learn about and analyze their identities and hxrstories [sic], feel proud of them, and actualize their full humanity," for where would any student identifying as white be led to �but that the belief their culture, history, and identity are white supremacist, are racist? This is underscored on page 13, lines 299-300, when the guiding value is said to be the cultivation of holistic wellbeing of all participants, but "especially Native People/s and people of color." Additionally, separating us into these intersectional identities and then identifying one of these identities as the cause of the injustices of society is in complete contradiction to page 1, line 16, that this teaching is to lead to the "eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism;" we simply cannot eradicate something by continuing to perpetuate it.

Creating a new section of social studies is redundant, as learning about people of all backgrounds and identities is already woven into the current curriculum standards (per CDE social studies state standards as accessed August, 2019 via CDE website). In an abysmally failing school system in regard to basic educational skills such as reading comprehension and mathematics, taking up our limited classroom time with an entirely new curriculum to repeat these teachings seems as misplaced priorities.

Finally, I have not had the sufficient time to study the hundreds of proposed pages and will leave other points to be made by those who have, but will maintain that what I have seen of this divisive philosophy is hurtful to Californians everywhere and most certainly should not be taught in K-12 public schools. There is nothing good to be gained by following the hateful rhetoric of the National Socialist German Worker's Party that separates us into racial groups and blames one race as scapegoat for societal ills; that led to one of the most murderous policies in modern times. As historians, we need to teach our children the errors of the past without replicating them; this includes the ugliness of racism in our own nation.
