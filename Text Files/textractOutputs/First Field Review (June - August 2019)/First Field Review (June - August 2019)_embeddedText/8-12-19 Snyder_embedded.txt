From: Van Snyder Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 3:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies curriculum
I am concerned that the Ethnic Studies curriculum being developed is an insidious cover for antisemitism. The curriculum outline is biased. Please develop an honest and unbiased curriculum.
