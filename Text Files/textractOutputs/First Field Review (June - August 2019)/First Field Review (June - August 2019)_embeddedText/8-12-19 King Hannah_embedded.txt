Our sons both went through Berkeley High where there was an introductory course about diversity and inclusion. But it was taught by some teachers in a very discriminatory manner against certain groups. We need to be careful that all teachers address all aspects of an issue and let students express their thoughts and gain understanding through discussion. When I now look at the proposed curriculum, I am worried that there is an antisemetic bias. With this in mind, I urge the committee to review the areas of the curriculum that seem to support Palestinians in a manner against Israel. I am worried that increased strife will occur between Jewish people and nonJewish people. In our current climate, many groups are fanning the flames of intolerance and hate between groups. We need to ensure that this curriculum does not divide, but helps students understand different groups and discuss differences to lead to

more understanding. We are stronger because of our diversity. There is a long history of antisemitism in this country and the world, and it is sadly, on the rise. This curriculum should not fan these flames, but instead, try to help people eliminate any hatred based on any religion. The curriculum should include a discussion of antisemitism, just as the curriculum addresses Islamophobia. As a matter of record, the most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. No curriculum should denigrate any country and certainly not get involved in politics such as BDS. A curriculum can address how students can be active in supporting their beliefs, but not specifically signal out a country such as Israel. Please reconsider developing a curriculum that helps students understand, discuss, and improve differences between multiple ethnicities, religions, races, genders etc.
Within the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC"), line 4955 provides a list of recommended topics for students to investigate:
Anti-Arab and Muslim Violence
Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter

The facts the ESMC omits are as follows:
The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel is an antisemitic movement that has as its goal eradicating the State of Israel. Its founders, including Omar Barghouti, have admitted as much. Germany has recognized BDS as antisemitic.
