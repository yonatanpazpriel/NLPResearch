I am appalled by the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum! It does not list anti-semitism as a form of bigotry. It promotes hateful boycotts against Israel. Despite the stated goal, the curriculum does does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning only in passing. With anti-semitism on the rise, the exclusion of Jews from the curriculum is deeply disappointing. Respectfully,
