From: NATASHA ZWICK Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: serious concerns from a serious teacher
As you contemplate this supposed effort to include all students and staff in the curriculum, let me share my thoughts as a long-time educator whose students of all backgrounds are made to feel part of a classroom community, a family, a safe space for rational dialogue.
This agenda is appalling. It not only leaves out key segments of the school population but also makes overt political stances. Supporting the BDS movement reflects not only an anti-Jewish, anti-democracy standpoint but also shows gross misunderstanding of the region and the goals of BDS leaders. The language in the MC is biased, misleading, and unbalanced. Most classroom teachers are teaching the youth of America about the devastating effects of hatred, both open and closeted. As a classroom teacher, I work hard to make sure my students feel safe, hear all sides of an issue, and research and think deeply and critically.
This biased, exclusionary package is so offensive, it should be shocking, but unfortunately, reasonable people can hardly be shocked anymore to see this kind of name-calling, ignorant judgment-making, and slander.
On August 15th, you have an important moral decision to make. Education is the most valuable tool we have to change the hatred in the world, and it is upon you now to step up and stop this outrage.
In justice, Natasha Zwick
