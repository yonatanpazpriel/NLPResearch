From: Michael Glass Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am quite concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Educating our students with a balanced understanding of our diverse ethnic backgrounds is so critical.
Please, lets learn from history, and not have history repeat. We must ensure we educate our students to ensure tolerance of all ethnic backgrounds.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Mike Glass
