From: Kate Lorig Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 10:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: opposition to ESMC Curriculum
I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed ESMC Curriculum. In doing so I reference the letter from the Jewish Caucus which elegantly points out my major concerns. Anti-Semitism has always been part of the fabric of America--not always obvious to non-Jews because we often look and act like the rest of White America. However, as someone that has lived from the time of World War II to today I know that it is ever present. In the old days my family could not buy a home, send their child to a private school or take part in many other activities because of religion. Because of my religion I was told by a major university in our state that I could not attend because they had filled their Jewish quota. Today, I cannot pray without heavy security and fear attending a public rally. I have been told "you don't look like a Jew" and it was meant as a compliment while in fact I was being told it was better not to look like a Jew. In the past year fellow Jews have been killed at prayer at least twice. Yet all this is ignored in the proposed curriculum.
Adding insult to injury is the inclusion of BDS in the curriculum. I say this as a Jew, like many Jews, who is conflicted about Israel and the role it plays in the world. Yet I know that that the issues are very complex. Judaism, Israel's right to exist, Zionism, and support of the Israeli government, are all different things. As Jews we are not monolithic in the support of all four. BDS does not make these distinctions and by its movement spreads anti-Semitism and hate.
It is time to reconsider and rewrite. Kate Lorig DrPH Partner Self-Management Resource Center
