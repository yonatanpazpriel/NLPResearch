From: Leslye Adelman Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 3:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
> I am joining with the Jewish Federation of LA, the ADL and the Los Angeles Jewish Community asking for your help. Antisemitism is the greatest threat Jewish people face today. The new State-mandated CA Department of Education proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum is wrong and I am deeply troubled and concerned about this initial draft of the curriculum and the challenge of ensuring our schools are teaching fair and appropriate content. The draft uses harmful Jewish stereotypes and marginalizes Jews. The curriculum minimalizes antisemitism and paints Israel in a negative light. Please take any time necessary to reevaluate the content of the proposed curriculum and make all necessary changes to provide the appropriate education. Thank you, Leslye Adelman
