The Study appears to set up a conflict between Whites and other ethnic Groups. There are too many instances to site them all, but "White supremacy", Colonialism, definition of Capitalism etc. One could use "fatherless families" also. I would much prefer an ethnic program that emphasized the future rather than the past. Common goals of all woven into one's own identity could be a positive. I question the comments on Ethnic Studies success as it now exits.

Ethnic Studies could include how each group could play a part to improve Society because of their unique cultures Black, White, Native American, Latino, Asian and emphasize the positives of each not the sins of one.
