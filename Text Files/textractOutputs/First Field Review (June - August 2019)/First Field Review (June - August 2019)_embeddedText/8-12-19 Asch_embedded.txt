I respectfully request the CDE remove its approval of the BDS and other antiIsrael material. This ethnic studies curriculum should only show positive information about various ethnic groups including our Jewish population. With the rise of anti-semitism, any negativity is inappropriate. All ethnic groups should be discussed in a positive light.
