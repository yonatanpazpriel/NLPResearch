Peter L Hertan, representing myself and my own views. I am a Trustee of the Los Gatos � Saratoga Union High School District Board. The Board has not taken a position on this.

I agree with the objectives of Ethnic Studies and the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I have the following observations about specific elements of the ESMC, which I note below, discussing each of my points in separate sections below.

1. There is a clear political message in the ESMC, having to do with oppression of minorities by certain groups.
2. Political messages, presented as fact, provide a learning opportunity for critical thinking on how to identify biases/prejudice as opposed to peerreviewed conclusions.
3. Generalization that oppression by an individual is oppression by a group to which the individual belongs.
4. The ESMC political bias reflects badly on the ESMC Advisory Commission (ESMCAC)
5. The Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) released a fatally flawed ESMC

It is true that certain minorities have their beliefs as to who and why their oppression arose, but there is no mention of the need and value of an examination of the evidence for and against those beliefs. There seems to be just an acceptance of one set of controversial views. Those views, and their validity have not been examined in peer-reviewed studies, as such they are personal political views not worthy of academic acceptance and therefore not worthy of inclusion in an MC. It is essential that students participate in discussions of the political biases of (oppressed minority) groups so that the students can learn how those political biases may have arisen and been embraced. But students also need to understand that there are usually opposing views about causes and they should seek to understand the opposing views and who the parties are behind those opposing views and why those parties champion those views.
This is the most insidious and commonplace error. Believing that an individual is representing a class without critical examination of the evidence that it is a class belief or action and not an individual belief or action. That is, students need to learn the skills to examine evidence and how to evaluate evidence.
Not only does the ESMC demonstrate lack of objective scholarship, but also a lack of understanding of the purpose of an MC for students. The ESMCAC does not show any appreciation for critical thinking in judging points of view and is evidence that a new ESMCAC needs to be appointed. Despite the representation that the IQC made 12 changes to the ESMC, the ESMC is so flawed that it calls into question the competence of the IQM.
