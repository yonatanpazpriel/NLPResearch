This is nothing but horse shit! Not only is is antisemitic, it fosters hate against white people! You know that is the intent to erase history & blame people who just so happen to be white! What headless person thought this would be a good idea? Why are you infringing on our rights as parents ( Sexualizing our children with false information & pandering to racist & extreme organizations like Planned Parenthood)? I pray this disastrous bill fails & is never brought up again! We, the parents will fight back against radicals who try to destroy what is left of education for our children!
