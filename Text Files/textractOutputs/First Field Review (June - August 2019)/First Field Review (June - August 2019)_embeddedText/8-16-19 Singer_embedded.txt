Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am deeply troubled by what I see in the model curriculum. The developers of this model curriculum have shown a deep bias and disregard for fully representing Jewish people and their history. I am advising that the model curriculum be seriously reviewed, corrected, and revised in order to adequately cover Jews and Jewish elements as a part of the ethnic curriculum. Please see specifics noted below.

The introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." However, the curriculum does not include a single lesson about the Jewish community, and only mentions Jews in passing. Antisemitism has been on the rise and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society. The exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply troubling and has left me dumbfounded.

This page is entirely unclear and uses language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country, which is not the case. This section frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. This section tells teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. The glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" without any critical perspective, including that a stated goal of much of them movement is actually to end the existence of the State of Israel.
