From: Gail Drayton Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:24 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethnic studies mandate
While I agree with the value of ethnic studies I oppose a mandate. Mandates are restrictive. I would rather see an elective course. Mandates take up course space...for example I might choose to take in high school a science course, a math course, a foreign language, english and history course yearly..if you mandate ethnic studies what do I give up ? thank you G Drayton, M.D
