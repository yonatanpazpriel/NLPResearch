From: Ina Bauman Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Subject: PLEASE RECONSIDER THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am upset by the recommended and flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request and urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you for your service,
