From: Jill Kasser Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 4:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Please make major revisions or a significant rewrite of ESMC
August 11, 2019 Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am alarmed by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. There is a clear omission of the contribution and experience of the Jewish community in California, as well as an omission of the dangerous rise of antisemitism both in California and in the United States. FBI records show a 37% rise in religious hate crimes, the vast majority against Jews. None of this is included in the Ethnic Studies Model.
Furthermore, there is a very unbalanced discussion of the complex Israeli-Palestinian conflict with a clear support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions against Israel. Rather than promoting inclusiveness of all communities, the Ethnics Studies Model Curriculum promotes hatred toward Jews and Israel.
This is clearly not the intention of the California Board of Education. I urge the board to revise this proposal so that the schools speak against antisemitism rather than promote antisemitism. Sincerely, Jill Kasser
