From: Aol Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 7:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Permission to bully
I just read the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It basically gives Students of Color permission to bully White and Jewish Students. This document would lead students to believe that no White or Jewish person has ever done anything decent. If the objective was to raise the White and Jewish Students suicide rate, the document is a success. If the objective is to bring people together as United States residents, it fails completely.
