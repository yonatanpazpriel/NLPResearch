[Page 233-235] The sample topics outlined are written in a manner that reflect singular points of view and, by doing so, omit relevant and inclusive facts and circumstances. For example, the over-emphasis of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the definition of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) in the Model Curriculum are both framed entirely from the vantage of proponents of BDS and fail to adhere to curriculum guidelines that require content to be taught in a manner that is "balanced", "inclusive", and reflective of "different perspectives."

Additionally, the topics do not represent a foundational framework necessary to properly educate students in a manner that is without bias and one that will provide them historical context needed to form opinions independent of that bias. It lacks cultural competence, nuance, and sensitivity to student demographics.
