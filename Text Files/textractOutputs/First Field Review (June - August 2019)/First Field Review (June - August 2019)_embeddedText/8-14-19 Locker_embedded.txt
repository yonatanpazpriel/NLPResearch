it's pretty outrageous in general. and since CA public schools rank among the worst in the nation, perhaps it would be a better use of our tax dollars to focus on enabling our kids to write and multiply! the board of education's head is in the wrong place!
let's teach our kids to hate Jews and Israel while keeping them stupid.
