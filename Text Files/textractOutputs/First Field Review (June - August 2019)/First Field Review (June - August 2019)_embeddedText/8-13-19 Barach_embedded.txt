Page 2, lines 30-40 This educational effort, meant to teach students about marginalized communities marginalizes Jews,does quite the opposite by omitting antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and strongly promotes the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement against Israel while doing nothing to contextualize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is very one sided and biased to one point of view. I believe that this curriculum is sorely missing lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. In recent years, Anti-semetic acts are quantifiably on the rise in Bay Area and around the world and teaching students about these issues will go a long way to eliminating this societal illness.
