I am the son of Holocaust survivors and a deeply grateful American who believes in the diversity of the country. I am troubled with one aspect of the proposal.
There are sections of the curriculum which omit antisemitism as a form of bigotry and openly promote boycotts against the State of Israel. Despite its stated purpose, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and as the American community most targeted by hate crimes based on religion.
In today's environment where minorities are continuously under assault based on religion ,ethnicity, race etc there is no room for omission of any as all must be included in the furtherance of establishing the perfect union and understanding each other.
Please modify your proposal so that when bigotry is discussed the most ancient form ,antisemitism, is properly included. Also please avoid even the appearance that your curriculum weaponizes a boycott directed at Israel.
Sincerely. Lee Twersky
