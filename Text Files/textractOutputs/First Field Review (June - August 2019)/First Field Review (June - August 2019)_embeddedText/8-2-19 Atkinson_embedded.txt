From: Mershon Atkinson Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 9:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies
Have you people gone completely nuts, and communist? The California Department of Education has gone completely far left, I think it's a waste of money, and a lot of the content is completely untrue, especially the part about capitalism being racist!
This curriculum needs to be scrapped and thrown on the dung heap where belongs.
Sincerely, Mershon Atkinson
