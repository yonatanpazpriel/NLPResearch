Page 1, lines 10-16 -- The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. Jews are a frequent target of racism and hate crimes. With antisemitism rising, and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including lessons about those who fled pogroms and persecution in Russia and Europe, the Holocaust during WWII, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Soviet Union.

Page 2, lines 30-40 -- A definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel claims that the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." No opposing critical perspectives are offered about this movement which seeks to end Israel's existence. The purpose of the BDS campaign is not to establish freedom. If it were, it would not target the only state in the Middle East and North Africa where its Arab citizens vote in elections, have freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of assembly. If it were, it would not target a state where Arab citizens not only have the same right to due process before the courts as any Israeli citizen, but are also judges in Israel, including on Israel's Supreme Court.

Sample Lesson Plans

Page 234 lines 4956, 4957 listed under sample topics
The sample lesson plans for the curriculum encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but offers no voices critical of their perspectives.
Page 237 Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country when there has never been an independent Arab state west of the Jordan River.
Page 242, 5158-5161 ...as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). This frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives and completely ignores that the Palestinian Arabs' leaders not only rejected the 1937 and 1947 partition plans, which would have created the first ever independent Arab state west of the Jordan River, but also joined five other Arab countries in a war to destroy Israel.
Pages 256,264-269 suggests using a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but suggests no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. I would suggest using content that seeks to unify rather than divide.
I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model ethnic studies curriculum.
