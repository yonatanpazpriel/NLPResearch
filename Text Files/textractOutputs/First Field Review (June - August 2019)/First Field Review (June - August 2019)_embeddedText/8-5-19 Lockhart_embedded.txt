Lines 297-307 (p.13): "Guiding Principle" 1 of the draft calls for Ethnic Studies to "cultivate... the holistic well-being of all participants, especially Native People/s and people of color". It seems to me that if "division is antithetical to Ethnic Studies" and this instruction is in fact intended to help "white students become stronger advocates and allies for equity" then the end of the sentence should be removed and the well-being of all participants should be cultivated equally without regard to national origin or color, remembering that discrimination and oppression can affect people of any ancestry and respecting the rights of all Californians pursuant to Art. I, Sec. 31 of the California Constitution. "Guiding Principle" 4 could also be rewritten to clarify that while capitalism may help whoever is currently in power stay there, it is not racist per se. Line 310 (p.13) and generally: If you want to reduce the extent to which "parents or community members are hostile to the field", "Guiding Principle" 6 should be modified to insert "nonviolent" after "connect ourselves to past and contemporary" and before "resistance movements" so the Principle reads "connect ourselves to past and contemporary nonviolent resistance movements" and any and all encouragement or support for citing murderers and terrorists as "potentially significant figures", "liberation warriors", or otherwise implying their behavior should be valued in a civilized society should be removed from the entire document.
