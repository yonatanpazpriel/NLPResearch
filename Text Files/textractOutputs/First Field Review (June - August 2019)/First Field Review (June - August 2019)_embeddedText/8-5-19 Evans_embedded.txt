From: Raymond Evans Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 8:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: my comments
I am a parent of two children who are going into 11th and 12th grade respectively-both in public school. Years ago, I volunteered, as a Junior Achievement volunteer, at Crenshaw High School. California ranks 38th out of 50 states when it comes to education. Education should concentrate on reading, writing and mathematics. I believe any ethnic studies should concentrate on entrepreneurship. There are plenty of amazing examples of African American, Latino, Asian, Native American and LGBTQ entrepreneurs. Students today need to be able to read write and calculate at grade level! They also need to understand how to start businesses, any thing else that distracts from the aforementioned is doing a huge disservice to California students
Sincerely,
