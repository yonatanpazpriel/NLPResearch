From: lorraine rose-lerman Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 12:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on program
As a resident of California, and one who believes in tolerance for all people, I am disheartened to know that you were planning to mandate a program of ethnic studies that unfairly represents the stories of some ethnic groups, or does not tell their story at all.
I am writing in opposition to the program as it now stands and I would hope going forward that you would find a process for review that would avoid these types of issues in the future.
Sincerely,
Lorraine Rose-Lerman Walnut Creek, CA
