Hello,
I am writing in response to the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum.
In reviewing the documents, immigration, alienation, and disenfranchisement with regard to Jews as an ethic minority is not included anywhere in the lessons. The Jews from Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa faced the exact same quota systems, humiliations, and barriers to entry that every other ethnicity has faced.
In including the BDS movement as one of social justice for Americans, be they citizens or not, is misguided, as all of the other social justice movements in your curriculum affect Americans. No other social justice organization whose aim is to affect foreign policy is included.
BDS is an organization that foments hate and misinformation. BDS does not strive to solve problems, only exacerbate them. BDS has nothing in common with the #youtoo movement or Black Lives Matter movement, which is working to bring justice to people living in the United States. Samara (Sami) Oberlander
