I think ethnic studies could bring tolerance and understanding but if handled wrong it could make violence against certain groups more likely. Antisemitism is probably the oldest prejudice and it is increasing with violent results. I have studied the Holocaust and wondered how ordinary humans could do these terrible crimes? Some of it is how people are raised by their parents, but in the case of Germany it was facilitated by years of lies from the Nazis. Every anti-Semitic stereotype was used and the Jews were called "rats" and blamed for the defeat of Germany in WWI. Until ordinary humans committed terrible crimes including murder and genocide.

The curriculum erases American Jewish history by failing to include Jews in a meaningful way, and it neglects any discussion of antisemitism which is on the rise. Further, it incorporates harmful anti-Semitic stereotypes in its completely inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American

ethnic groups. It institutionalizes the teaching of anti-Jewish stereotypes in our public schools. BDS is not just a nonviolent protest movement like Martin Luther King. Please look up Omar Barghouti who founded it and what they really want. He opposes the two-state solution and they want descendants of Palestinian refugees to have the right to immigrate to this state, while Jews from the Jewish diaspora will not be allowed in. Soon there would be no Israel. Also look at what the 3 letters stand for: Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions. Sanctions, really? Is Israel an international outlaw state that deserves sanctions? The motives of BDS are extremely transparent. They want the destruction of Israel. The only real solution to the Israeli Palestinian question is the two state solution. BDS does not do that, the opposite. They wanr the destruction of Israel. It is a good idea to have ethnic studies and try to eliminate prejudice and stereotypes, but Antisemitism is an ancient prejudice which has resulted in the deaths of millions. Antisemitism deserves to be addressed as a separate chapter in the course. Also. For the record, many of the civil rights workers who marched and worked with Dr. King were Jewish. Please address Antisemitism in a fair manner and do not contribute to it which I think this course will do.
