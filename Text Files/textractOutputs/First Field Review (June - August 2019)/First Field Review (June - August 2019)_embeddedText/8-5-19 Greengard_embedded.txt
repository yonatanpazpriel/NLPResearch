From: GLKG Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 3:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As a lifelong Californian and proud graduate of our public schools, including UC, I was shocked and disappointed to read details of this proposed curriculum. In following the misleading and hate-filled BDS agenda, it presents a biased and false picture of Israel and Jews. This is unworthy of California's educational aims, and promotes division and rivalry instead of inclusion and camaraderie.
In our state, nation, and world nowadays we are seeing the dangers of such misrepresentation and divisiveness. Please remove this malicious and dangerous material from the proposed curriculum.
Sincerely,
Gloria Greengard
