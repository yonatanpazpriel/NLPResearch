I write to you as a concerned citizen about the current version of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). While I do not dispute the need for more education of our children, the ESMC does not meet the stated goals of the authorizing statutes. Specifically, it reflects a distinct anti-Jewish bias. The ESMC ignores the American Jewish history in any meaningful way, fails to discuss antisemitism and reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews. How can an ESMC not discuss hate crimes against Jews, while including bias against other communities? As evidenced by several recent events in the news, Jews are being specifically targeted for actions of hate. I am especially appalled by the use of age old stereotypes such as stating that Jews control the media. That has been misused since the time of Hitler. Given the fact that antisemitism has been on the rise, why would educators wish to promote such a hateful statement?
I believe that these issues are easy to fix and urge you to do so before exposing our children to such misinformation.
Thank you. Debra Lambeck Sherman Oaks, CA
