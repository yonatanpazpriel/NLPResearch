As parents, educators, residents of California and Israeli Jews we are very uncomfortable with the including this content in the California curriculum. We think that its important that the students would get familiar with conflicts in middle east from all prospectives. Hopefully they would get involved and help resolve those conflicts. But we are very unease with the including of the BDS contents. Personally we believe from educational point of view that inclusion is not the a solution and in any conflict one should try to get all parties to join together and take responsibility to resolve the conflict. More specifically, the BDS promotes the inclusion of Israel and promotes hate and division. While it tries to help resolve the Palestinian problem in the entire middle east, an important and valuable problem, it doesn't recognize the state of Israel and the rights of the jews to also live in Israel. As our family still living in Israel will not leave Israel and stay to live along side the Palestinians organizations should find ways to bring both communities to live in harmony and peace. Unfortunately BDS is doing the opposite, this controversial organization spread only hate and thrives to the inclusion Israel and Jews from Israel. We believe that this content would impact our kids and our community in a bad way creating a false picture of the reality in the middle east and the ways to resolve it.

In addition we are urging the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum: A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:
Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
