As an educator for the last 14 years, I've been taught to present ALL sides of an issue, ensure students can determine credible sources and allow the student to base their beliefs on factual information. This coursework undermines all of those things. Why is white supremacy included but not other racist groups? Surely you can't believe that there are no black or Hispanic racist groups. If you don't believe that, please look on the Southern Poverty Law website. How is capitalism patriarchal? This is one of the foundations of America, and what has allowed the nation to prosper beyond any other country. This country used to be the great melting pot where you can become an American, share our common history and traditions as well as keeping your own heritage in tact. This is still the land of opportunity, but only for those willing to work. Additionally, we as a nation have encouraged unity, and not separation. By classifying people by gender or non-gender, race, and class you are segregating the population. Some of the "vocabulary" included is still colloquial and not in the public's vernacular. Some of those words and phrases should be eliminated from your agenda because they are biased. While ethnic studies is a valuable educational course to be considered, this format destroys what is great about our country, focuses on hate and blame, and will divide the population further. Thank you,
