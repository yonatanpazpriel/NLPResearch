Dear Department of Education, The ethnic studies program as proposed is a program designed as political indoctrination more so than education. It seems to be crafted purposely and presumably to stifle any discussion and to promote a specific political (anti free market) point of view. Although there seems to be some factual basis which may be important In a well rounded education, there are elements promoting blame, shame, and flavored with bizarre political jargon.
Implementing such a program will further degrade public education, leading to continued flight into private and charter schools.
Solution: Find a more well rounded group of educators not steeped in pseudo Marxist jargon with real world experience who understand real historical perspectives and encourage discussion.
Thank you for your attention. Michael Bartos Napa
