From: Sam Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:16 PM To: CFIRD Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
On a personal note, I received my M.A. from Sonoma State University. As the son of two Holocaust survivors who met at Auschwitz, I take a special interest in the surreptitious ways in which virulent Jew-hatred is seeking to reinsert itself into the body politic. The wolves have learned that the best way to bypass the safeguards against antisemitism is to pretend to be sheep.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Kind regards,
Dr. Samuel Hilt
