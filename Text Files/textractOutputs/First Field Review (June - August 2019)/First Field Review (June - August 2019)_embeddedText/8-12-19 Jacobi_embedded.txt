No discussion of Anti-Semitism or ways to combat the increasing Anti-Semitism in this state is in this curriculum. Anti-Semitism is by far the largest category of religious hate crimes. Instead this curriculum promotes the "boycott, divestment and sanctions" movement whose goal is overtly Anti-Semitic . This curriculum would add to this states Anti-Semitic climate which I experience frequently.
