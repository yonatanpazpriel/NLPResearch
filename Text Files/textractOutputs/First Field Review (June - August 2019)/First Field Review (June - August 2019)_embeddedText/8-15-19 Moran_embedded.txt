From: Claire Moran Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
I am troubled by the current version of the ethnic studies model curriculum.
I read in the "J" that the curriculum, ". . . excludes Jews and Judaism from its discussion of ethnic groups, is one-sided in its view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, does not deal seriously with anti-Semitism, and even uses an anti-Semitic trope."
Please revise the curriculum so that it will not have the problems mentioned above.
Thanks.
