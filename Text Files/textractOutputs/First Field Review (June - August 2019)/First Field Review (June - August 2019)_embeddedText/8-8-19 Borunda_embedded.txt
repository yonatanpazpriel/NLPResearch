I am writing in support of the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I have been following the development and growing support of the Curriculum and know that, more than ever, we need this Curriculum in our schools. This is the time for California to lead and with this Curriculum, we are in the position to do so.
Our children deserve to learn truth. They deserve the opportunity to learn about and value the experiences of a wide range of people who enhance our communities and our nation. With a Model Curriculum to open the communication and awareness of diversity, we can, as a nation, develop improved cross cultural relationships and appreciation for inherent differences across cultures. As a former school counselor, I spent fourteen years in public schools where I constantly engaged children in learning how to trust and appreciate one another across racial and cultural divides. As a professor who has taught multicultural counseling courses for the last seventeen years, I find adults lacking historical events from our own nation and state that inform the way we perceive one another. Having this knowledge provided in our schools would ensure that we can build bridges across this lack of understanding as a result of missing multiple perspectives.
My hope is to see the Model Curriculum in all schools soon. Thank you for your support and vision of creating a more harmonious and informed student body who will ultimately lead the state of California. Respectfully,
Dr. Rose Borunda, Interim Director, Doctorate in Educational Leadership Faculty, Counselor Education Department
