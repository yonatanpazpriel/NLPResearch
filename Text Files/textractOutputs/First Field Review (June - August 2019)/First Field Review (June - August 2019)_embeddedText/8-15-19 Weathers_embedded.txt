The Proposed Curriculum is Severely Flawed and Unfit for Use
The proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, developed by the California Department of Education, is unfit for use because of a potentially dangerous anti-Jewish bias.

The proposed curriculum marginalizes the religious identity of Jews and attacks the national heritage of certain Jewish immigrants. The authors are biased and facilitate indifference toward Jewish persecution and promote anti-Israel perspectives. Curriculum should focus on critical thinking not the promotion of a very specific (antiJewish) political cause.
The result of the curriculum would be to create hostile environment that facilitates discrimination based on ethnicity and national-origin. Israeli-American and Jewish minority students would face a material threat to their safety and civil rights.
Curriculum should be rooted in tolerance and acceptance. Instead, the Jewish experience is ignored, and bigotry is promoted.

The Proposed Curriculum Promotes National and Ethnic Based Discrimination and Would Make California Party to Anti-Semitic Hatred (Glossary, Page 2, Lines 30-40)
The promotion of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction Movement (BDS) in curriculum is problematic. The BDS Movement uses classic anti-Semitic themes, such as the suggestion of Jewish subversion, conspiracy, disloyalty, greed and economic control, and most importantly, blood libels. The State of California must not be made party to anti-Semitic hatred.

Jews and Israeli-Americans Were Intentionally Excluded from the Proposed Curriculum
Despite being an Ethnic Studies curriculum meant to objectively focus on American minorities, the American-Jewish community has been excluded. Given the many obvious points of Jewish communal contribution throughout the history of the United States, as well as the high-profile nature of anti-Semitic attacks that have recently taken place in Poway and elsewhere, it is obvious that this omission was not merely due to an insensitive oversight, but rather disturbingly, was intentional.
In general, the Jewish people are a distinct group bearing a variety of religious, ethnic and cultural characteristics. Likewise, they collectively possess a unique and relevant history, cultural practices, traditions, and have made key contributions to American society. American Jews and Israeli-Americans possess a unique immigrant experience, tracing back to the American Colonial period and extending through more recent waves of arrival. This includes those who fled the Holocaust and persecution, as well as others who have come to make unique contributions to America. Despite facing discrimination, Jews and Israeli-Americans have nevertheless come to exemplify important aspects of the merits to be found in America's overall values, and have made many impressive contributions to society. To invalidate Jewish and Israeli-Americans by excluding their worthwhile narratives would teach the wrong lessons to students.
If anything, now is a time to enhance students' understanding and overall sensitivity toward the Jewish community. A report issued by the Anti-Defamation League detailed a shocking 67% increase in incidents from 2016 to 2017. A 2015 Brandeis Center-Trinity

College study found that most Jewish-American college students had personally experienced or witnessed anti-Semitism. An AMCHA Initiative survey found a 45% increase in anti-Semitic activity on college and university campuses between 2015 and 2016. Given that anti-Semitic incidents are increasing at an alarming rate in the United States, it is outrageous that the proposed curriculum would nevertheless seek to instead promote the anti-Semitic BDS Movement, which has been widely condemned for its anti-Semitic nature.

The use of misleading comparisons between the territorial dispute between Israel and the Palestinians to racial inequality challenges in America is harmful and illegitimate.
The Proposed Curriculum Improperly Equivocates Israel with Historic American Injustices
In a section on suggested topics of discussion, the proposed curriculum makes a problematic attempt to suggest equivalence between issues faced in Israel's region and those of the United States (Page 234, Lines 4956-4958). Specifically, equivocating the situation between Palestinian-Arabs and Israel with that of the

Chapter 2: Sample Course Arab American Studies Course Outline

United States and African-American citizens or immigration concerns is a false comparison aimed at manipulating negative perceptions and hostility among unsuspecting audiences. The effect of this dangerous misrepresentation will be to demonize Israeli-American peers and could easily result in the targeting of Jewish and pro-Israel students by those with strong feelings on BLM and immigration.
The Proposed Curriculum Teaches students that Factual Integrity and Objectivity Do Not Matter
The bias of the proposed curriculum is particularly evident in its use of highly-charged language that inherently promotes a negative perception of Israelis (Page 236, Lines 4992; Page 242 Lines 5158-5161). This bias is consistent with propaganda that frames the modern reestablishment of the Jewish national home in Israel as a "catastrophe." Students must receive the facts of history with integrity and objectivity intact, free from one-sided revisionism and corrupting political biases.

Regarding feminism, Sarsour has charged that Zionist-feminist women are not true feminists, in an effort to dispossess them of their identities. Even worse, she joked about the removal of the genitals of a prominent feminist who had been the victim of FGM. Furthermore, Linda Sarsour associates with anti-Semite, Louis Farrakhan, and publicly embraced deported terrorist, Rasmea Odeh.
A person who embraces terrorists, stands with anti-semites, jokes about FGM, downplays anti-Semitic victimization, and support BDS discrimination is not a fit role model for California's students.
