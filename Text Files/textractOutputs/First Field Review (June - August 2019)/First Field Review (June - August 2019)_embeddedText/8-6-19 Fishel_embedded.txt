The proposed curriculum needs to be re-evaluated considering the following
proposals:
~Include lessons about the Jewish escape from persecution in Europe, the
pograms, Jewish lives as immigrants in the United States, the rise of fascism
in Europe, the hatred of Hitler who masterminded the genocide of six million
Jews who had no place to go, the legal granting of statehood to Israel in 1948,
the oppression of Jews in Arab countries after the establishment of Israel and
their ultimate escape to Israel, discrimination in the Soviet Union which led to
a mass exodus to Israel, the rescue of Ethiopia Jews who faced
discrimination because of their Jewish religion, the many efforts Israel has
made for peace with her Arab neighbors.
~The value of the inclusion of all minorities is important when teaching this
curriculum.
~There appears to be an advocacy for the BDS Movement which is
controversial and promotes hate and division rather than an advocacy of
renouncing terrorism and living in peace.

~I note a false equivalence in regard to Israel's efforts to protect herself from terrorism with US policies on the border with Mexico. These are two entirely different issues and should be taught as such in regard to the issue. ~The History of both the Jewish people in what was called Palestine since the days of the Roman Empire and the history of the indigenous people of that region should be taught, incorporating the rule of many empires through history in that area making it clear that "Israel-Palestine" (P 237) is not one Arab country. ~Offer alternative narratives of the 1948 war (P. 242) with a goal towards balance and truthfulness. Indeed, there are alternate narratives but a sound curriculum would search for truth and avoid propaganda. ~Avoid harsh criticism of either side and offer truthful assessments of the leadership of the region and the lives of the people (P.256, 264-269). For example, in Israel the highest performing group educationally are Christian Arabs. ~Educate the students about the governments and civil liberties in all of the countries in the Middle East. ~Include the history of Antisemitism and the current disturbing rise of Antisemitism in the United States and Europe. ~Include the achievements of Arab minorities in Israel. ~Demonstrate a commitment to your stated goal: "Enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism". Sadly your objectives are not achieved in what appears to be a curriculum of discrimination against Israel and the Jewish people.
