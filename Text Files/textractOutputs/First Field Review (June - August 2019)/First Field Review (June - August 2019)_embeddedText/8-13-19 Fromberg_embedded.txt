Dear Sirs/Madams
Whether ethnic studies provide a benefit of any kind is questionable. Emphasizing American history and the country's constitution, legislative and judicial processes, however, provides educational value for adolescents and prepares them to participate in civil society. Inculcating youth with the notion that they have been and are still victims will have the opposite effect. Prior educational failures such as learning in one's native language, new math and whole language reading should cause the educational establishment to proceed cautiously.
In this regard, I cite Williamson M. Evers a research fellow at the Hoover Institute as follows: "Instead of an objective account of the history of ethnic groups and their current situation, this is a biased portrait emphasizing suffering and victimization, serving as a kind of road map to create ideological activists based on racial identity."
Lastly, I also strongly object to the term Nakba, the favorable characterization of Boycott, Divest, Sanctions, and the use of the term Islamophobia without mentioning anti-Semitism which many American Jews have experienced.
It is questionable whether this curriculum should be adopted at all, but if it is, it should be substantially modified so that it presents a balanced picture of American life, both past and present.
Respectfully,
Jeff Fromberg
