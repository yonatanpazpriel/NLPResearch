From: Ben RIch Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 2:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum
I read through the draft this morning and now appreciate the challenging task that the authors and advisory committee faced in developing this important curriculum model. Unfortunately, in my view, this work falls far short. Many of my concerns have already been addressed so let me just briefly repeat what has been said by others.
Specifically, the Jewish experience in our state and nation are seriously neglected and/or misrepresented by this draft. In addition, the draft singles out Israel inaccurately and unfairly for condemnation. I highly recommend that the Legislative Jewish Caucus criticism be fully weighed as very positive and constructive.
Perhaps a more inclusive committee is called for as this important work continues.
Respectfully, Benjamin Rich Chino Hills CA
