I am a board certified, fellowship-trained, clinical neuropsychologist. My comments on the model curriculum are based on over 20 years of clinical experience assessing and treating children and adolescents from a wide range of highly diverse cultural, ethnic, racial, socioeconomic, religious, academic, and experiential backgrounds, as well as results of methodologically sound, peerreviewed, published research in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, cognition, learning, social psychology, and sociology.

I have grave concerns that the model curriculum--as currently constructed--will be counterproductive. It focuses on grievances of four specific minority groups commonly referred to as "people of color" (Hispanx/Latinx, AfricanAmerican/Black/Brown, Native and Indigenous Americans, and Muslim/ArabAmericans) but excludes the experiences of other historically oppressed minority groups who have immigrated in search of political safety and economic opportunity. displaced, persecuted, and attacked, including

A limited focus on a small subset of oppressed minority groups constrains and polarizes thinking, encourages "us vs them" group identification, and will not produce the (presumably desired result of) decreasing bias, stereotyping, and divisiveness.

A healthy educational model avoids taking a narrow perspective. It encourages the development of critical thinking and thoughtful problem solving strategies that can be creatively employed to improve society functioning. It avoids "blaming" that fosters maladaptive attitudes and behaviors (i.e. stereotyping, prejudice, resentment, anger, and aggression).

Thank you for considering my input.
