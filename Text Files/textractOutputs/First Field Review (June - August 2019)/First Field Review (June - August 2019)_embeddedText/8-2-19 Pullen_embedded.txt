If the California Dept of Education wishes to discuss capitalism as a racist agenda, then please explain socialism as an oppressive agenda. Please describe E. Germany, Venezuela, Brazil, Czech., USSR, Cuba, and Poland when they were considered to be socialist countries, as early as the 1980's. I have been to 3 of those countries and have seen extreme poverty and suffering due to socialism. There is a long history of starvation, death due to illness and neglect, and homelessness. If you wish to discuss any forms of government, please discuss all forms of government. Thank you.
