From: Marsha R. Stone Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:19 PM To: CFIRD Subject: Curriculum hijacking
I read a curriculum proposal this morning which was so short-sighted (at best) and deliberately divisive (perhaps) that I sent a letter to the State and to my elected officials.
And now I take the next step and ask that you please immediately establish safeguards for ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, be carefully constructed to represent our goals to promote democratic values for all, to encourage democracy, and to heal past wounds.
It sadly became obvious to me today that safeguards must be in place to ensure that curricula not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite divisiveness, nor slander any race, religion, group or individual.
Sincerely, Marsha Stone, High School Teacher
