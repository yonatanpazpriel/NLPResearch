I very much appreciate the effort put into developing this model curriculum. The author's use of an explicitly anti-racist framework is something that will have a profound impact in the classrooms. I am sure that students across this state would benefit by learning about their own history and that of their classmates. I also understand that no single curriculum can capture all of our experiences and I look forward to seeing how others, inspired by this curriculum, can continue to make sure our students learn about the complexities of our collective history.
