From: Graham Sherr Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 12:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I write to express my deep concern about a proposed ethnic studies curriculum in which Jews as a minority are absent, and the nation state of the Jewish people is demonized. It is remarkable that such a curriculum be proposed at a time when the largest number of antisemitic incidents in the U.S. in 2018 occurred in California. In my view, this proposed curriculum reflects intersectionality run amok because there are no Jews allowed in the intersection. I urge you to reject this curriculum unless it is revised dramatically to be inclusive of Jews and far less one-sided in its treatment of the Israel-Palestine question.
Respectfully submitted,
Graham Sherr
