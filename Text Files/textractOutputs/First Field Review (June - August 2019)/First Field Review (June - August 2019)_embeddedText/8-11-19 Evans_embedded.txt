From: Karen Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 2:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Request revisions of ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned about the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. I was raised a Christian, but my grandchildren (ages 11 and 8) are being raised Jewish. I think it's horrible that they could encounter institutionalized anti-semitism as early as high school. I urge you to make major revisions in the ESMC consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Thank you,
Karen Evans
