Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I write to you as I am extremely concerned by the proposed ill conceived and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class in theory, but Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is highly objectionable and urge you to revise it consistently with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I completely agree with the letter from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus which makes the following points:
We support diversity and inclusion, but oppose a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools."
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses.
The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to antiSemitism.
The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews.
The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement. As Asad AbuKalil, Professor of Political Science and BDS leader at the University of California has said, "The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel."
The over-emphasis of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the definition of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) in the ESMC are both framed entirely from the vantage of proponents of BDS and fail to adhere to curriculum guidelines that require content to be taught in a manner that is "balanced", "inclusive", and reflective of "different perspectives". While Jews are an indigenous ethnic group to modern day Israel, and a significant minority in America, our voices are omitted in all curricular references to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.
The one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish students may be stereotyped, accused of dual-loyalty, harassed and forced to face social litmus tests.

For these reasons, I urge you to revise significantly the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely, Jennifer Campfield
