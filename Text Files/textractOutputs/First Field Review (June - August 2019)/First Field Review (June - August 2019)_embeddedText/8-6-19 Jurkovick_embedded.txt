From: David and Jackie Jurkovich Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 7:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum I began reading this document but had to stop. So I have not read more than Chapter 1 and some of the Glossary. When I have more time, I'll try to read more of this leftist propaganda. I'm probably wasting my time doing this since being conservative in California is like being Job in the Bible (you'll probably have to look up who Job was ). Respectfully,

Using "x" in spelling real words is biased and alienating to the general public (especially older) in my opinion. Pg 1,Line 13-14: the critical thinking that this "curriculum" fosters is one of victimhood and hatred of our country.

Pg 2, Lines 32-38 & 46-53: the bias shown is further proof of the leftist agenda of this "curriculum" to enhance victimhood and hatred ("critically conscious") for our country. Pg 2, Lines 42-47: Capitalism. The definition is negatively biased. Capitalism is an economic system � not political. It can be manipulated by people through the political system whether democratic, oligarchic or totalitarian dictatorship like in China. Also, "profit" is made by having more income than expenses produced not only by human labor but mechanization also. Plus, anyone can be a "capitalist" in our democracy. Pg 14: Where is the definition of socialism which is the economic and political system that actually degrades and dehumanizes its citizens (look at Venezuela). While well meaning, Ethnic Studies as biased as this "curriculum" is, will only further "balkanize" our country which is what the left wants to do.
