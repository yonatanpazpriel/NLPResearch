I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced in chapter 2, page 1, lines 17-25, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.

Including a history of migration to the US (chapter 2, page 236, lines 4986 - 4990) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.

I teach AP World History and College Prep World History in a diverse high school in Daly City, CA. We have a number of students who identify as Arab American that have been impacted by the Muslim ban (as their families are Yemeni). Supporting an inclusive curriculum that includes topics such as Arab American history would allow students across the board, and particularly Arab identifying students, to see themselves reflected in curriculum. In a political climate that is exceedingly hostile to Arab Americans and immigrant Arabs, positive messages are necessary to combat the damage that federal legislation and mainstream stereotyping have done.
