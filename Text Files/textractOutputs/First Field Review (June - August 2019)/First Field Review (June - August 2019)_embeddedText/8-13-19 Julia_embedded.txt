From: Ornelas-Higdon, Julia Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: support for ethnic studies
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education, For over 50 years, communities of color have struggled to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. Students and faculty have advocated for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a legitimate academic discipline through sit-ins, rallies and strikes. Research shows when Ethnic Studies is taught, it results in narrowing and closing of the opportunity gap for students from underserved communities.
We urge you not to give in to right-wing racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, antiprogressivism, and anti-intellectualism that does not respect the languages, histories and cultural backgrounds of students of color. Students should be given the opportunity to study about their ancestral roots to better understand the present, and be able to imagine a brighter, more just and equitable future for California, the US, and the world.
Sincerely,
Julia Ornelas-Higdon, PhD Assistant Professor of History, CSU Channel Islands
