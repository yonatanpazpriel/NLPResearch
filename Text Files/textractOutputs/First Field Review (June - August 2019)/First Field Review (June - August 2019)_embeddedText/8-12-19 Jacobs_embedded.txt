Page 2, Lines 27-31. After reviewing the mention of "various power structures and forms of oppression", I noticed that Anti-Semitism was not included in the list. There has been a noticeable increase in Anti-Semitism worldwide, including here in California. Annual FBI statistics show that Jews lead the list of antireligious hate crime victims (58.1 percent were victims of crimes motivated by their offenders' anti-Jewish bias) in a typical year, including the most recent statistics available on the FBI website (2017 year). I hope you add Anti-Semitism to the list in the final version.
