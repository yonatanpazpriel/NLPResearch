From: Debbie Cabanday Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 8:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Ethnic studies curriculum
To whom it may concern,
I'm a lifelong California resident with a rising senior and rising sophomore, both of whom are enrolled in LAUSD high schools. After reading several news articles on the new Ethnic Studies curriculum, I must say I'm very disturbed. From the news reports, the curriculum is extremely biased against Jews. This calls into question the entire curriculum and it's ability to teach this subject matter in an unbiased way. Ethnic Studies should also not include the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly when that has nothing to do with Ethnic Studies and it is being presented in such a biased manner. Teachers are not equipped to discuss the complexity and history of that conflict, and it seems from reports , the people putting together this curriculum are ill-equipped as well.
While Ethnic Studies is important, it is also important that it be taught in an unbiased way. And, it should only be a semester if it's mandatory, like health. But given the reports, it seems like this curriculum falls far short of being unbiased, and as such, should be tabled until a full review is made to make sure it's appropriate for all demographics.
