Howard Sugar California retired resident The Proposed Curriculum is Severely Flawed and Unfit for Use

The proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, developed by the California Department of Education, isdeeply flawed and unfit for use. As outlined below, these flaws include the pervasive use of materialfalsehoods, misrepresentations, and the exclusion of necessary facts and foundational information. It isapparent that the authors' bear a predatory purpose: to systematically facilitate the development of anti-Israel perspectives among impressionable students.This matter is particularly insulting and outrageous given that California's Jewish and IsraeliAmericancommunities have gone to great lengths to make the truth readily accessible to our broader community.Indeed, the pool of instructive resources and relationships at the disposal of educational administratorsand state policymakers is vast. Any objective observer of the proposed curriculum can readily gather itssystematic employment of demonization, delegitimization and double standards � each of which canindicate anti-Semitism. Sadly, even the mere proposition of this curriculum brings into doubt theintellectual standards and moral character of many who are involved in California's educational system
