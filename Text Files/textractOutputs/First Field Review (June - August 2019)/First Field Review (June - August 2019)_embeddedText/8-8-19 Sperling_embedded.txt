I am Jewish, and I've lived in California my whole life. When I was a teenager, someone tried to burn down my synagogue. Last year, a plot to bomb multiple synagogues in Irvine was fortunately thwarted. This year, another terrorist was not caught in advance and murdered people at a synagogue in Poway. Antisemetic hate crimes are on the rise, including in California...

And yet the ethnic studies curriculum includes NOTHING about antisemitism???

I want to believe the best of people, but I have a hard time believing this wasn't intentional. Not only are Jewish people left out of the curriculum as a marginalized ethnic group, I also see that the only definition in the glossary that focuses on international affairs is the long, detailed, and one-sided description of BDS. There is no other mention of anything specific to countries outside the U.S. Combined with the complete lack of any materials addressing antisemitism, this crosses the line from misguided to sinister.

Changes I would like to see: - Add a definition of antisemitism to the glossary - Remove the unbalanced definition of BDS from the glossary - Rewrite the Arab American Studies Course curriculum to better reflect the diversity of Arab immigrants in California, including Mizrahi Jews, Coptic Christians, Assyrians, Yezidis, and other non-Muslim groups as well as Arab Muslims. Experiences from Arab immigrants of multiple backgrounds must be represented.

- Seek input from representatives of the groups to be covered in the curriculum, INCLUDING JEWISH CALIFORNIANS.
I strongly support the idea of the ethnic studies model curriculum, but the current draft is indefensible. I look forward to seeing improvement in future drafts.
