In a country in which there are 3 times as many crimes committed against Jews than against any other religious group, it is worse than irresponsible to omit anti-Semitism from an Ethnic Studies Curriculum. Anti-Semitism is the oldest form of discrimination going back 2,000 years and continues to rear its ugly head today. Not a day goes by without a news story of Jews and their property being assaulted. I note the following areas that should be reviewed. Glossary, page 2, lines 30-40 Sample Course Models page 234, lines 4956-4958 and 4964 Sample Course Models page 235, lines 4970, 4972, and 4974 Sample Course Models page 241, lines 5138, 5143-5144 Sample Course Models page 242, lines 5157-5163 Sample Course Models page 268, line 5792 Sample Course Models page 268-9, lines 5802-5803 Sample Course Models page 269, lines 5820-5821 Sample Course Models page 278, line 6008
