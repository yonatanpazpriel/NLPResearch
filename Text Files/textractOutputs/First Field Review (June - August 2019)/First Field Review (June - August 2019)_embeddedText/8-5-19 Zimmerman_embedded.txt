Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
As a Piedmont California resident, I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. I am urging the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Also, important to include the thousands of contributions made by Jews
