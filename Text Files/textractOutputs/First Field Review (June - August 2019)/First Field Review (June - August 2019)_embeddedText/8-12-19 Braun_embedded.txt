Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the curriculum draft. My understanding is that the curriculum takes on the challenges of contextualizing the history of anti-ethnic group behaviors, which I agree is an important educational subject. My concern is that the curriculum doesn't call out antisemitism. This is an important area to include, as it has powerful cultural , historical and existential power, is academically well studied, is richly supported by literary, musical, cinematic literature, and is quite current in the news, both in terms of anti-semitisim and in understanding important aspects of middle-east politics. It would be a shame to exclude this educationally rich area
