p4 line 87 of sample course modelsesmc .docx Some examples of systems of power are: white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy. ** I believe this is way off base. America would be nowhere without capitalism.

If you don't want capitalism then you want?? Venezuela? Cuba?? They are NOT doing very well. I have been to Cuba, dual currency; stand in line with ration cards for simple things like oil, flour, sugar, and rum. I didn't see anything on how abortion clinics are focused in areas that predominately have people of color. And I didn't see anything about what makes one a certain ethnicity. A 1970 Louisiana law defined as black anyone who had at least 1/32 AfricanAmerican blood -- and in 1985, a state court upheld the legislation. Will that be covered?? The US is a melting pot - maybe that should be mentioned, or as Rodney King said, `can't we all just get along.'
