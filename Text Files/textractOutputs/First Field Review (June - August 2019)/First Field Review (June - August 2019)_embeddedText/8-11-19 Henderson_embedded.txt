From: Susan Henderson Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Way too ideologically biased
I am appalled at the draft for the ethnic studies curriculum. It is obvious the writers were ultra liberal, and have anti capitalist and anti Jewish ideologies. It is hard to believe this sort of curriculum would be drafted as any sort of recommendation in any state in the United States. I seriously believe the goal of the drafters of this proposed curriculum, is to indoctrinate young students to socialist, anti capitalist, anti Jewish, beliefs. In testing, students would be forced to answer in agreement with the curriculum goals, or receive bad grades. This draft needs to be completely rewritten by other people.
