We are a biracial, co-parenting family. Our daughter is a Riverside County public high school.
We were told we have inly a few days to voice our concern about California's new ethnic (indoctrination) studies being added to core curriculum.
WE ARE NOT IN FAVOR; these kind of "agenda based" education models are what drives responsible American parents to favor school vouchers and non public school alternatives.
Our eldest daughter fared better in a private school. Our youngest daughter is doing well in public school; she loves her school, her teachers and her classmates. Please don't force us to remove our daughter; as would many others in our circle of influence.
If there are liberal, socialists, marxist leaning educators and parents who want their children to learn about BDS, anti capitalism, anti-family , socialist choices, let them do so on their own time or after school.
