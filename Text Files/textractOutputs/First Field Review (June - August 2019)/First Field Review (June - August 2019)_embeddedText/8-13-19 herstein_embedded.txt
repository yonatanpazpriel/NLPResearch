Hello, I am writing to express my deep concerns over the content and language of the proposed new curriculum to the California high school ethnic studies model.
I am an American citizen and have been residing in the Bay Area since 2009. I was born in Israel. I have 3 daughters who are/will be i the California educational system and therefore directly affected by this curriculum. After reading the proposed content and language I am surprised and appalled that the state of California would consider including such biased and unbalanced materials.
- Only a few months ago we all witnessed the horror that occurred in Poway where a hateful person shot and killed Jews in a synagogue. This, only 3 months after a similarly horrific massacre in Pittsburgh. Yet hateful crimes against Jewish minorities are NOT addressed in your curriculum. There has been a 60% increase in anti-Semitic incidents since 2016 in the United Sates and I am dumbfounded as to why you would choose to exclude this issue.
- BDS as a movement receives a whole unit is your new proposed curriculum. This movement was recently condemned by Congress and is associated with hateful acts against Jews and anyone who has publicly supported the State of Israel in the US and beyond. Not exposing the dark side of BDS does an injustice to people who support Israel and is politicizing the academic curriculum.
By including this biased and politicized content you are creating a hostile environment for Jewish students in the public schools of California. I strongly urge you to revise/rewrite this model to include an honest perspective of American Jews. Ethnic studies are a chance to bring people together vs drive them apart. It's your responsibility to protect ALL students who go through your school systems.
Sincerely, Maya Herstein
 Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned  ï¿½ Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even
though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective

 A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included
