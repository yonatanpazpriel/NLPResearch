Many entries in the glossary are grossly discriminatory against Israel, and are overwhelming Leftist in nature. They are not academic, objective, or neutral, and instead contain far left political messages. This chapter uses the silly word "hxrstory," taking political correctness to a new height of dumbness. It will help make California laughing stock. In usages like "xdisciplinary," the document becomes silly and once against exposes the State of California to ridicule. In usages like "recontextualized," the document engages in pomo litcrit language that no one except insiders will understand.

The entire chapter needs to be rewritten so that it meets standard academic standard, is neutral, objective, and does not have a political or deconstructionist bias.

Comments on proposed California Dept of Education Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, continued
The sample course models continue the Leftist bias of the Introductory Chapter. They need to be rewritten to reflect standard academic scholarship, without a political bias. The samples are full of accusations like oppression and heteropatriarchy/cis-heteropatriarchy. They read more like brainwashing and propaganda than like an academic curriculum. It also uses language like Misogynoir, that are only understandable to the people who wrote the document. Overall, this proposed document needs to be withdrawn and rewritten by neutral objective people who are not biased in favor or against any particular group. That includes not being biased in favor of Leftist deconstructionist ideas, and not biased against Jews.
