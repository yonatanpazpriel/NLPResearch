From: E and Z Weinstein Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 12:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies ; CFIRD Subject: bias
Looking over the new 2020 model curriculum for ethnic studies it is obviously pro palestinian/BDS bias.
My question is why should the middle east conflict, of all conflicts in the world, chosen.
Why if anything mentioned, there are only few word of the genocide of the Syrian people at the hand of the murderer Assad and his Russian collaborators that is still going on?
Also why jews were excluded from being defined as an ethnic group.
Looks like someone with a extreme leftist and anti semitic bias and without an historical understanding, took over the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee of California and is determined to infuse his disastrous Nazi-like agenda into the next generation of California children.
Both me and my wife (a retired school teacher) are very disappointed and will do everything we can to fight this garbage
Please strike down sec 5140, 5141 and 5142 for falsehood and cheap propaganda
Best wishes
