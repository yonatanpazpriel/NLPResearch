Page 1--omits the definition of Anti-Semitism, documented hostility toward or discrimination against Jews as a religious, ethnic or racial group. Any ethnic studies program must recognize the historical fact of Anti-Semitism and that such incidents are on the rise in CA, the nation and around the world. Page 2--BDS should not be included in this section. BDS is a blatant form of Anti-Semitism, singling out Israel and the Jewish people to the exclusion of all others. The curriculum should present a more well rounded discussion of human rights around the world. Page 234 Lines 4956-4958 Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter should not be included-- or at least not without a balanced reflection on Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state within secure borders. The curriculum should not be calling for participation in specific political movements--it's call for participation in BDS is unacceptable and furthers a bias against Jews. On page 4958, comparing the border of Mexico and the US to the borders between Palestine and Israel is not valid. At no time has the US denied Mexico's right to exist or routinely thrown bombs into Mexico. This is a false and misleading comparison.

Page 242, lines 5157-61 use politically biased language to refer to the founding of Israel.
Page 268-69, lines 5802-03 use the Anti-Semitic trope that Jews control the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
