The curriculum excludes Jews AS AN ETHNIC GROUP entirely � an outrageous omission that can only be explained by outright antisemitism. It further concentrates on the Middle East conflict in a deceptive, lying, and manipulative manner. The establishment of the independent Jewish State � in a land that has been continuously Jewish for the past 3200 years � is referred to as a "Catastrophe" ("Nakba"). It maliciously and anti-Semitically omits the forced displacement of Jewish refugees from Arab lands -- were these Jewish communities lived LONGER than the surrounding Arabs. The total number of these Jewish refugees (and the land expropriated from them) was significantly greater than the number of "Palestinians" displaced from Israel.
