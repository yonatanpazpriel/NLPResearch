INTRODUCTION:
Overall, the thought and caring behind the introduction is appreciated, but the insistence on "X" without a discussion up front seems presumptuous and almost aggressive/retaliatory. As well as open-minded, caring, justice-oriented caucasians, people of color often use the dominant, common language of history, interdisciplinary, etc., and not providing the rationale and context up front seems disrespectful--and perhaps excessively confrontational--to everyone who is in a state of transition to these issues. This may seem too conciliatory for your mission, but I recommend bringing your footnote #1 "Throughout this model curriculum, language is used..." up to the top. Marketing-wise, you want to capture your audience first, and this audience includes many conservative, mainstream teachers. Provide the context right away so we are all starting from the same place. Please don't see this as catering to the status quo, but rather like opening a door into a new world that doesn't have to be frightening nor disrespectful. And frankly, some of the words with "x" are simply cumbersome, so there is a practical element to this as well. Along with directly confronting biases inherent in our culture, please consider that ignorance is generally the problem, and that with information comes acceptance, admiration, and respect. The culture in power is woefully ignorant! "56% of respondents said that schools in America shouldn't teach Arabic numerals."

Line 7: hxrstory--too complicated to pronounce and should be offered as a suggested alternative. The creation of this word is appreciated, but many words which might have gender origins--once absorbed into the common language--no longer hold gender references*. Eg, the "his" in history is gender-specific when extracted from the word, but when used as a whole those are letters within a word with a larger meaning that goes beyond gender.

Even woman and humankind contain man, and removing that context doesn't necessarily further an egalitarian cause. One could argue retaining these historical words is a daily reminder of how far we have come. And I am a firm believer that someone could say "history" with complete respect and dignity to the student, whereas someone could say "hxrstory" with contempt and derision. In some ways our language is like a grandparent who we handle with some extra respect. We excise the bad parts over time through shared cultural values. Forcing the language can be done immediately for truly disparaging racial slangs, but I'm suggesting we allow some time to make changes to "architectural" words such as history.

Line 22: xdisciplinary--what is the purpose of this modification? It is cumbersome and vague.
Line 29: Why include one specific culture here [islamophobia]?
Line 32-33: Why not just say...."Ethnic Studies [is disciplinary, in that it variously] takes the forms of being interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, undisciplinary, and interdisciplinary.
Line 35: her story and women as womxn...this is more kindly put than the beginning of the text. One could argue being too specific through one lens doesn't really capture the full problem. Do we need to add letters to a word to denote a wealthy privileged person?
Line 39-53: Thank you--it is lovely!
Line 59: "Beyond providing a hxrstory and analysis of oppression and power, Ethnic Studies..." substitute with... Beyond providing an analysis and timeline of oppression and power, Ethnic Studies
Line 69: Thank you for "nepantlas." I've often felt this way even within my own culture. This can help all people feel more united.
Line 81: Is there room for expanding this overview to include other oppressed cultures? Indigenous peoples, jews, the disabled, etc.

Line 120: Maintaining support and guaranteeing departmental funding for Ethnic Studies should be a given.
Line 125-126: There is certainly room to consolidate some of the traditional American history between elementary and middle school to provide for an Ethnic Studies history course. Our kids have found the redundancy in 5th and 8th grade to be unnecessary. Eighth grade might be a very meaningful time to insert this class, teaching it entirely through the ethnic lens. This could influence/pressure the high school US history curricula in a positive way.
Line 148-161 There is something critical missing from these! Nowhere does it point to the absolute commitment to searching for the TRUTH within our studies. Albeit truth is relativistic on some level, this should always be our goal. This is the foundation for empathy, justice, and community.
Line 172: The most memorable lesson for our high school freshman was a research report on Colonialsim. He chose the Congo and it was life-changing for me since I had no experience with this history.
Lines 174-175 and 263: This is too narrow and needs to expand to meet the broader set of cultures which have been endangered in the US but also worldwide.

Line 216-222: Although I would be entirely supportive of offering an Ethnic Studies course as a UC/CSU approved elective, I would also like to see some flexibility built into the system that allows teachers to infuse this into their lessons, Respect for others and giving a voice to students is something built into every classroom experience, similar to what we are trying to achieve with ES.
Perhaps there should be more effort put into providing guidance/lessons for teachers who are weaving ES into their course?
Line 287: Since this is a model curricula which is meant to guide teachers, is there any part of this which is mandatory? Perhaps that is contained somewhere in the full document/proposal, but as a teacher I would love to see the ES priorities for my subject area so I can be certain I am covering what is essential.
Thanks for all your work, and perhaps it needs to be shorter or organized with more visuals than text?
