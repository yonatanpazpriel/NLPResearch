From: Nancy Schatzberg Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 2:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti Semitic concerns
Upon scanning ethnic studies proposal it seems that antisemitic issues have been over looked This is of great concern given the increase in anti Semitic attacks in recent times I believe these should be directly addresses along with all the other issues directly stated in proposal
Multiculturalism should be looked at as a strength .. all should be protected
