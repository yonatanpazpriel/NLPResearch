I disagree with the model's description of Capitalism as a "form of power and oppression". It is the system that has allowed the US to grow, survive and thrive to become the leader of the world it is today. People flock here from other countries to be free and partake in all capitalism has to offer. You would not have "ethnic studies" without it today. If you want to teach Ethnic racism continue with your model, if you want to teach children how to think critically and succeed in America, teach Capitalism,
