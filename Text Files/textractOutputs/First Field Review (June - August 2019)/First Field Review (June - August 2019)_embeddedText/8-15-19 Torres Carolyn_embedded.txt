Carolyn Torres, 7th grade world history teacher.

I support the model curriculum in its entirety. I have taught 10th grade and 7th grade world history. I can tell you that even within courses that are supposed to be about the world, there is lack of curriculum that centers the experiences of people of color in the global south. I spend countless hours looking for resources that will affirm my diverse students. If I didn't I would be left with a limited perspective of world history. I have facilitated professional development around Ethnic and Gender studies that I have incorporated in to my world history courses. All students should have access to Ethnic Studies curriculum and not be reliant on a teacher to infuse her courses. This model curriculum has already helped with areas that I have limited lesson plans on, for example the Pacific Islander and Muslim communities and histories. Hiding from tense discussion is not the way to educate our youth. This model curriculum is way over due and it would be an injustice to not adopt it.
