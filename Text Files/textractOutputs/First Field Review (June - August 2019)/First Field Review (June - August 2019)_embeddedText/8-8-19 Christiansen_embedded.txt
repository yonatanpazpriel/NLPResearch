Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The content of these pages while describing struggles some, does not include the perspective of others. To wit, were I teaching, I would want to include both sides of every debate, namely, Palestinian and Israeli voices, a balanced view of the BSD, and include American Jews as an ethnic group--there would be much reason to study reasons for marginalization during late 19th and early 20th centuries with regard to immigration in particular. I would want to encourage dialogue that delves into the US/Mexico border and the Israel/Palestine border rather than promoting a top-down approach to the conflicts and misunderstandings in these parts of the world and let exploration of the ideas be governed by fact. Studying one group ought not come as a result of having excluded the other. As a Cal grad, I always tried to find the other side of the coin and I would love others to learn to do the same in California schools. Thank you.
