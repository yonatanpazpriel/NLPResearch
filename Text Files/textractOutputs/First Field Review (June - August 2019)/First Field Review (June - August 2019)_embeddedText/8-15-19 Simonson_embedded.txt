Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)]
There are many Jewish people in California & Israel who deserve to be portrayed as peaceful & decent people who have a rich history .Many have ties to Israel. or live there who want peace but live in fear for their lives due aggressive attacks from surrounding populations of people who want their land & do not respect their history or their belief the land given to them by their God.. There are also a population of Jewish people who are Messianic believers in Christ who join with non Jewish believers living peaceful & loving lives reaching out to their neighbors with benevolence & ethnic sensitivity in Israel & California., as well as around the US, Some of the writings in the model curriculum have negative & racist comments & opinions about Jewish people both in their history & those living in California. There needs to be some revision & a second look at opinions expressed to correct prejudice in some of the practiced agenda being propagated by the BDS & others writing against Israel in this document.
