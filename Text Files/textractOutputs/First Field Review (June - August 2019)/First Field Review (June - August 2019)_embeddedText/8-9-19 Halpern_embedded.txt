BDS, by its very nature, is based upon its own version of hate and racism if both viewpoints are not disclosed.

Additionally the sample lessons for the curriculum prevent teachers from sharing the Israeli side of the argument, thereby exacerbating the very thing (racism) this curriculum is supposedly designed to calm: bigotry, racism, hate.

The proposed curriculum does not provide the Israeli point of view, or criticism of Palestinian leaders, thus greatly slants the message and perspective.

The introduction of the curriculum states its goal as: giving teachers the opportunity to aid the eradication of bigotry, hate, racism. This goal cannot be achieved if students are not presented with viewpoints from both sides of this ongoing bitter divide.

Arguably the Jews have been the most persecuted and victimized group from racism in world history; yet the Bibliography does not include anything on historical or current about the Holocaust, Antisemitism, Oppression in the Middle East, or Nazi Germany,.

Are students in California to be exposed to issues of race and hatred, with goals of inclusion... yet not to be exposed this antisemitism ???

This Bibliography is negligent is not providing appropriate information and coverage of the issues listed above, and shameful if allowed to remain excluded from the Bibliography.

The concept and description of "Culturally responsive/relevant teaching," is great; although the rest of the glossary descriptions are misdirected and fall far short of this curriculum's intent.
Sadly, this curriculum is littered with bias and nondisclosure against sharing the story of bigotry and hate toward Jews and Israel. Its implementation supplants minds with beliefs based on one-sided depictions; whereas omissions create unfounded ignorance toward racism and inclusion.
