I have just had the opportunity to review the new proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum. And while I believe that this is a terrific idea and especially needed in these days of contention. I must strongly object to the lack of inclusion of any positive information about the migration of Jews to this country, the need for same, and especially the inclusion of a module on Boycott, Divest and Sanction that is so completely one sided. [Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here]

Glossary �Page 2 � Boycott, Divest, and Sanction. While this is certainly a comprehensive description of the concept, there is no nuance or indication that there are varying levels of BDS, including just applying to Gaza and the occupied territories. Can we count on the instructor providing this information in a way that will encourage fair and non-threatening (to any Jewish students in the classroom) manner?

While not listed in the Glossary, I notice multiple references to the Nakba, but not to the Holocaust or other genocides (Armenia for example). Call to BDS - It is appropriate to talk about BDS and how it has been used to further social justice. BDS is a powerful tool but what will be done make sure the space is safe for all students including the Jewish students?

I must strongly object to the lack of inclusion of any positive information about the migration of Jews to this country, the need for same, and especially the inclusion of a module on Boycott, Divest and Sanction that is so completely one sided. Reference to Nakba. I understand there are two sides to this painful time. Will the circumstances be discussed? Will the fact that at the same time thousands of Jews living in other Middle Eastern countries were kicked out, unable to take their possessions. Will you discuss that millions of displaced refugees, into the 3rd generation, continue to live in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon because those countries refuse to let them settle? What responsibility will be assigned, or even discussed, by the 20 other Arab countries in the area to encourage these refugees to leave their homes because of the expectation that the Jews in Israel would be slaughtered or pushed into the sea? Term Israel-Palestine. Could you be more inflammatory? Israel is a country that has now existed for over 70 years and is recognized by the U.N. I understand that you are presenting this module to open up understanding of the Arab community. But because it is so profoundly interconnected with the Jewish community, I suggest that you need to either expand this module or add one that includes the early and ongoing immigration of Jews and why they actually have much in common with the other ethnic groups in this curriculum.
