As a 6th generation Californian, educated from kindergarten at Arden School (Sacramento) through UC Berkeley, I must protest any and all Ethnic Studies curricula which hints at or supports political views of anti Semitic and anti Jewish indoctrination. It is imperative that our students, my grandchildren, are taught objective facts, not subjective philosophies.
As a loyal Californian, a committed community leader, a proud American, an informed voter, but most importantly, a devoted, worried, and involved grandparent, I'm begging you to protect our students from the biases in these Ethnic Studies. Sincerely, Susan Sperber
