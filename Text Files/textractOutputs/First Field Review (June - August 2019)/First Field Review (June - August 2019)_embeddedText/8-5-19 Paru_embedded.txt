The definition of the BDS movement is factually and historically inaccurate, inflammatory and anti-Semitic. It describes BDS as a "is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." This is, again, completely factually inaccurate and antisemitic in that it demonizes the only Jewish state in the world. Only a little factual research would demonstrate that the "conditions" under which Palestinians live (in Israel, where all the citizens, Palestinian, Arab and Israeli, enjoy the same rights and there is an Arab party in the Israeli parliament, and outside of Israel proper, in Gaza and the West Bank). The definition also omits that BDS specifically does not seek peace in the region � it only seeks to harm Israel, it does not seek to hold Egypt and Jordan accountable for the harm they have done to the Palestinians (including the Egyptian wall with Gaza and the numerous massacres of the Palestinian people), BDS has ties to terrorist groups, BDS's actions have harmed Palestinian people economically (as with the Soda Stream factory in the West Bank) showing that again, BDS is not a movement for the Palestinian people, but a movement solely to harm and demonize the only Jewish state in the world, and BDS members routinely harass and intimidate Jewish students on campuses all over the US, for no other reason than that they are Jewish. If my children are to study BDS, I would like the

curriculum to reflect that BDS, while its stated goals may be to help the Palestinians, is nothing like that in reality. As many political movements, it started with a noble goal, but its purposes have been warped and its impact is not only harmful to Palestinians, but also anti-semitic to Israel and the Jewish people of the world. BDS promotes hate and division, not peace and inclusion, and seeks to end the only Jewish state in the world and to harass and intimidate Jewish people in the United States and worldwide. Similar comments about BDS. Also, when discussing "activists" like Linda Sarsour, there should be guidance to discuss her well-documented antiSemitism and the calls to demonize the only Jewish state. Linda Sarsour has called for a "one state solution" which in practice would mean that the only Jewish state in the world would cease being a Jewish state. As a Jewish person and a parent of Jewish children, this is incredibly hurtful and frightening.

The sample lesson plans for the curriculum: � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). � Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). � Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). � Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
