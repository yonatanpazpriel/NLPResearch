If this curriculum is intended, as outlined in Section 2 of general principles to "Promote the values of civic engagement and civic responsibility" and " Encourage cultural understanding of how different groups have struggled and worked together," (with the focus on working together, not the struggle) then by definition of civic engagement, which is: "working to make a difference in the civic life of our communities and developing the combination of knowledge, skills, values and motivation to make that difference. It means promoting the quality of life in a community," this model curriculum is failing it's most critical objective of promoting accurate, unbiased knowledge and motivating people to work together to promote life in a community. Drawing people together in community successfully occurs through peaceful understanding of individual's modern experience. When history is fairly presented, independent statistics and facts are used. This curriculum fails to adequately address the experience of every nationality and every ethnicity - which has shifted and changed as people have migrated and coinhabitated lands and combined cultures and worked together. The curriculum focuses instead on only experience of people of color and appears so limited in scope in time and history that it fails to capture the broad human challenge that humanity must constantly confront as each new generation is born and follows natural cycles of human development including mental, physical, inter-relational and spiritual growth. When historical `personal' experience is raised than this can only be fairly presented when experiences from ALL people involved is presented. And should be presented throughout ALL time, not just from a select few groups of people and not just at select points in time. In failing this, this curriculum fails to encourage unbiased cultural understanding. By having "an emphasis on experiences of people of color in the United States" it creates a false distinction. All people are of color. And the experiences of people of color are not unique to them alone. For example, humans have enslaved one another for centuries - dating back to ancient Egypt and Greek times �slaves were made when one group conquered another, regardless of color. In more recent American history, Germans, Women and Blacks were all granted less rights than other citizens of St Louis, MO, being relegated to attending services in basements and being buried outside the city walls of the city. Power relationships exist throughout the natural world, and examples can be seen among nearly all species. In humanity, education on power can positively teach empowerment, but risks inadvertently promoting a sense of victimization. Community building and empowerment occurs when the focus on `working together' . In contrast however, victimization occurs when the focus is on the struggle and the hurt. Personal life experience, individual responsibility and maturity are the key contributing factors to community building, This curriculum, by only focusing on few ethnicities, and as written, risks dangerously creating victimization mentalities for students of any ethnicity featured. By failing to objectively present the reality that all humans are impacted by power relationships, this curriculum will .

Sample Lesson 1 Pg 5-6 "Content and Language Objectives:

1. Years after slavery, many African-Americans continue to live in poverty because of racist, discriminatory laws.

2. Institutions exist that keep people of color in positions of disadvantage despite of the narrative of equality for all.

3. Where you live can determine the opportunities have and how successful you are in life.

4. In instances such as these, should African-Americans receive reparations from the
government for institutional injustices?

THESE STATEMENTS ARE UNNACCEPTABLE AND OBJECTIONABLE AS CONTENT AND LANGUAGE OBJECTIVES FOR THE CURRICULUM. THESE EXAMPLES OF BROAD LANGUAGE WHICH IS BIASED AND UNQUALIFIED IS BEING USED HERE WHICH UNFAIRLY REPRESENTS MATTERS AS IF THE INFORMATION IS ENTIRELY TRUE. The same statements could be said for Causcasions, Asians, Hispanics, Women and more. There have been and continue to be laws that in trying to favor one group or population or agenda, discriminate against another.
It is faulty to focus on just `select' ethnic groups for this type of education. All ethnic groups need to be presented, because students don't have the time/option to take numerous different specialized ethnicity classes to get a fair balanced and well rounded viewpoint on the matter. All ethnic groups experiences should be presented. For example, abuse experiences of Germans, Italians, Irish, Chezch, Polish, Jews and others., Their positions of disadvantage and poverty is not being presented nor is the question being postulated that they too, along with women, "receive reparations from the government for institutional injustices " .

While potentially well intentioned, this curriculum as outlined and potentially implemented (with an instructors own personal bias), is the basis for building bias and division among young people who have not had the experiences for themselves. The United States is unique in its young history where people come to build new lives, for new beginnings, and in some cases to move from past mistreatment or misfortune. This is a common bond among all Americans that promotes community and individual responsibility. This curriculum risks creating a mess of angry sentiment and victimization, harboring over events of the past in which today's students were not part, nor have the ability to be part of. It fails to put ALL ethnicities experiences into proper context which then promotes division instead of community.
