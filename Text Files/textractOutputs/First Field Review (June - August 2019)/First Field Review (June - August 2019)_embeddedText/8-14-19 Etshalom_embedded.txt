Glossary lines 29-40; your material assumes that Israel is an apartheid state � this is a common anti-Zionist (and anti-semitic) trope that we've heard since Durban in 2001; in now wise do Israel's national policies resemble the horrors of apartheid as practiced in South Africa. To glorify the generally discredited "BDS" movement as an attempt to force Israel to comply with international law ignores the fact that Israel has not violated any international law � unlike her neighbors (Egypt, Syria, Saudia Arabia to name 3) who regularly violate human rights laws and norms. Your socalled curriculum, at least in this regard, is nothing more than baseless propaganda, premised on the notion that if you repeat a lie enough times, it will be accepted as truth.

I don't see any concern for the rights, cultural and human, of Jews around the world who are currently under siege and attack in North America (Poway, Pittsburgh), Europe (Cacher and many more), South American (the bombing of the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires). Hate crimes against Jews have accelerated in America at a faster rate than against any other group � why does your curriculum ignore the Jews? Your curriculum teaches California students to repeat hateful raps by Arabs, presenting Israel from their point of view � where is the Israeli voice? Why don't you include some of the many poems which Israelis have been writing and singing since before 1948, pleading for peace and coexistence?
