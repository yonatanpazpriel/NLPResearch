Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable) The program misrepresents the Israeali Palestinean conflict. BDS is mis
represented. Jews have been victims of ethnic cleansing which is not mentioned.
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] Glossary Page 2 misreprements the definition of BDS. BDS does not recognize the difference between Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. BDS sees the entire territory as Palestinean. This is untrue. Israel is not an apartheid state. Jews are a small minority, and have suffered discrimination as well as ethnic cleansing as recent as the Holocaust in the 20th century. The world Jewish population was cut in half by the Holocaust and none of this is even mentioned in the curriculum. Therefore the overall program seems to be biased instead of objectively educational. Once again the curriculum is one-sided. Why isn't Jewish migration even mentioned? This is told from an arab perspective. Who has written this curriculum? The one-sided view is dangerous in that it can indoctrinate students without a full understanding of complex situations.
