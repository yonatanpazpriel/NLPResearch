From: Oren Lavee Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:40 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: CA School Ciriculum
I strongly feel discussion of BOTH sides of any issue will promote understanding and compassion. This Ciriculum seems to ignore the reality of the Holocaust and also the legitimacy of Jewish country.
Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel.
I encourage you to rethink the short and long term effects this proposed change, as drafted, could create.
