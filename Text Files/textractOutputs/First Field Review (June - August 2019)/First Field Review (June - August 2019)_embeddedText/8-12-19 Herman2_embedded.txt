[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] I am writing to object to the deeply slanted and inaccurate proposals in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. It is one thing to create courses that illuminate the ethnic experience in America. It is quite another to proposes courses that foment hate, which is what this does with its elision of Jews and hostile treatment of Israel. It is simply not true that the BDS movement "is a global social movement that currently aims to
establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." First, it is not a very popular movement, and second, the purpose of the BDS movement is to "establish freedom," but to eradicate the state of Israel. As Omar Barghouti, the founder of the BDS movement says, ""A Jewish state in Palestine in any shape or form cannot but contravene the basic rights of the indigenous Palestinian population and perpetuate a system of racial discrimination that ought to be opposed categorically....Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine (my emphasis, see this video: https://vimeo.com/75201955).

The anti-Jewish bias of this document is evident from the elision of Jews, but the inclusion of Arab-Americans, within Ethnic Studies. Jews are obviously an ethnic group, and equally obviously their experience in America should be studies. There is no reason for their exclusion other than Anti-Semitism. In sum, this document reeks of bias. It should be scrapped, and the process started over again.
