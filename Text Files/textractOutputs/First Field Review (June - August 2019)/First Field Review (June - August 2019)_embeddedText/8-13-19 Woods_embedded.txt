From: Ellen Woods Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Thurmond; JIAC Subject: Rewrite the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum: Include the Jewish Experience; Eliminate Anti-Semitic Content
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am dismayed that the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes study of the Jewish experience while promoting Anti-Semitic content. As a 40-year educator at the college level and a participant in the foundation of the Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity program at Stanford University, I strongly endorse that every high school graduate in California have access to fair and balanced instruction related to the history and culture of ethnic and racial experience in the United States and around the world. This knowledge can only benefit our society by creating opportunities for mutual understanding.
As I understand it, the current version of the curriculum is neither fair nor balanced and promotes the opposite outcome than the stated intention. Incidents of Anti-Semitism have been increasing over the past few years; in my hometown of Pittsburgh PA my childhood synagogue was the scene of violent murders of innocent worshipers. It's hard to overestimate the potential influence of false claims against Jews if teachers and textbooks are spreading them as true.
I urge you to make major revisions and to rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
