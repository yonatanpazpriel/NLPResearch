This new curriculum is blatantly anti-Semitic. Anti-Israel or Anti-Zionist rhetoric is the same as Anti-Semitic. Calling the State of Israel "Israel-Palestine" or "Palestine/Israel" is not only not accurate, but shows extreme bias. The name of the country is "Israel." You cannot re-write history or geography to suit your own needs. Or should California be called "California-Mexico" and "Mexico/California"? (Line 5407 on page 253 to Line 5479 on page 256) (Line 5614 on page 261 to 5693 on page 264) (Line 5580 on page 260 to 5612 on page 261)
Hip Hop as Resistance � the conversation via Busta Rhyme and Narcy is offensive to all Middle Easterners and is inappropriate for classrooms. Who cares what these rappers have to say? Comparisons of the conflict between Israel and the Arab nations and Black Lives Matter and the border issues with Mexico is inaccurate and misleading. Where are the chapters that include information from Arabs who live in Israel (not Gaza or the West Bank) who decry the message that Israel is an Apartheid state. Where is the information that shows that Arabs are represented in the Knesset? Why don't you propose teaching about all of the positive things that happen in Israel � by both Jews and Muslims.
What happened to education that teaches facts rather than opinion? Just because what is being proposed is a Left agenda does not make it any less racist than if it was a Right agenda. Racism is racism. And Anti-Semitism is Racism.
Your "ethnic" studies is a euphemism to talk about minorities � well Jews make up less than .02% of the world's population. Less than Muslims, less than Blacks, less than Hispanics, less than Asians. And Jews have been persecuted as much, and in many instances, more than those other minorities. Synagogues and Jewish Centers are being targeted at rates higher than most any other institution for hatred and violence. Is there a reason why in 2020 Jews � specifically Jewish children - need to be persecuted in California schools as well?
