Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This model curriculum would encourage students to hate anyone who belongs to the "oppressors" of our history, meaning anyone who is white and of European descent. It ignores the genuine contributions of white males and paints them as evil oppressors, without regard for their actual behavior and beliefs. It divides humanity into ever-smaller niches based on skin color, religion and other characteristics that the civil rights movement traditionally said were irrelevant in judging a person's merit. I am appalled by this model curriculum and urge the State Board of Education to reject it.
1. Lines 306-308: critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy,

cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and

oppression at the intersections of our society;

Equating capitalism with white supremacy, racism and all the other -isms completely ignores the progress made throughout the world in eliminating poverty and increasing the well-being of millions of human beings.
