Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Prof. George Reisman's book "Capitalism" gives an accurate understanding of capitalism. This curriculum does not.
The curriculum is totally improper in ALL other respects too. It should be shredded. A revolutionary group has produced this trash, designed to brainwash children. There is a lot to be said for studying areas like Black History, but not this way. Bobby Seale is hardly comparable to Frederick Douglas or to black capitalists like Arthur G. Gaston, or to black figures in many fields of science and art. Forget about instilling new forms of pronouns and changing words to eliminate his, her, or whatever. This is the most ludicrous and crazy idea to come along in a long time. This curriculum has the goal of reducing appreciation of factors that have objectively made America a GREAT country, and of destroying values that are essential. These are to be replaced by uselsss, counter-productive ideas that surely do not benefit the students.
