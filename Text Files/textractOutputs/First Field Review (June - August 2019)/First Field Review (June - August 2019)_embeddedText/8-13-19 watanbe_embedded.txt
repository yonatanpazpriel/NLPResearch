Line 7. The use of "hrxstory" is not proper English and gives an indication of an agenda-oriented educational pathway. In these days of diminishing respect for The Academy, this type of exclusionary language only serves to alienate the very targets it needs to address. As a person of color, lines 27-31 run counter to the narratives of Asian peoples and may be viewed as exclusionary of their own success. Further, as a gay person, the narrative of oppression runs counter to the historic record, particularly in the post 1985 era. This again serves to separate members of one community into a victim block and prevents them from interacting effectively with the population at large in terms of CTE goals.

Lines 134-171. Given the focus of the community college is only partially transfer but mostly CTE, this curriculum core does not address the needs for easy movement into the workplace. Rather, it feeds into employers' own fears of hiring non-male, non-Caucasian employees for fear they are not hiring the most qualified person. Additionally, with the loss of male students in general and Caucasian males in particular, this particular line of inquiry is sure to create further motivation for males to avoid higher education and to instead view the trade school/CTE as their only options. The lack of balance in the programming language means further that those who are not "in step" with the agenda will in turn reject it. With the continual focus today on the high cost of education (admittedly not in CCCs but certainly in our private institutions), this is exactly the type of curriculum development that will foster in working class and lower middle class citizens that a college education has limited value. Further, there is no proof that this focus decreases truancy. In my classes in high school, we are still faced with an alarming tendency of African American students to decry academic studies � even those focused on identity studies � as "acting white." I see no attempt to address this core concern. Lines 339-342. The section on "relevance" is not academically sound. None of these outcomes ("both culturally and community relevant, and draws extensively from the lived experiences and material realities of each individual student") has real world or academic relevance beyond a narrow band of educational elite. Again, this runs counter to the lived experience of Asians, who have succeeded despite illegitimate incarceration by President Roosevelt. There is no proof that engendering social discontent inspires educational excellence or the foundation necessary to go for a meaningful career. Lines 441-442. The forcing of students to engage within the community and in a very specific, confrontational manner disallows academic freedom on the part of the student to question what the instructor is teaching. This runs against the core of what education's supposed goal of learning HOW to think not WHAT to think.

Line 63. "Capitalism" is a foundation of the American experience and understanding it is necessary for success, particularly among impacted communities. To have a class that counters the importance of capitalism being central to success in the United States is to do a disservice, particularly to communities of color and non-conforming gender. Hollywood, for example, is a perfect example of inclusion within a Capitalist framework. From the standpoint of needing a message that encourages further education and lifelong learning, the program's very foundation is flawed and its results are counter to stated goals.
