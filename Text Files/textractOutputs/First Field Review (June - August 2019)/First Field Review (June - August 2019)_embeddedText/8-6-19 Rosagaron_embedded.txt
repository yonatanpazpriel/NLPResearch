This is a phenomenal curriculum that is much needed for the students in our beautifully diverse classrooms. It gives students the knowledge and language to continue understanding the nuances of their identities and the ethnicities of their friends and peers.
While no one curriculum can highlight each and every marginalized community, it is problematic that in a curriculum touted as inclusive, there is a black and white perspective set in the characterization of the relationship between Palestinians and Israelis and the history between the two peoples.
In an effort to present a nuanced view that makes space for the shades of gray within the complexities of the relationship, please consider adapting the following areas of the curriculum to offer various viewpoints and voices:
Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269)
Thank you for your consideration.
