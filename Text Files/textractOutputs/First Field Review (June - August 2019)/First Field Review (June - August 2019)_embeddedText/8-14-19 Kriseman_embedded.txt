I am a California resident and my child goes to a California public school. I am very concerned and frightened by the treatment of Jewish people in this curriculum. While addressing racism, homophobia, islamophobia, this curriculum deliberately omits discussion of anti-semitism. It also openly promotes anti-Semitic propaganda under the veil of anti-Zionism. Claiming that Jews/Israelis control the media is fascist, neo-nazi propaganda. Antisemitism is a growing threat across the world and here in California. Two terror attacks against synagogues were committed in the last year. Antisemitic hate crimes are rising. On campuses in California universities, antisemitism is thriving. Not long ago, a Stanford college student was denied a leadership position because of her "dual loyalties" as a Jew. Not long before that, swastikas were spray painted at Jewish fraternities at UC Davis. Not addressing these dangerous issues with the curriculum will help create future generations of anti-semites who will see their hatred of Jews as justified.
