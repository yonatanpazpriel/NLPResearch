California schools, by and large, are receiving a failing grade, which means we are failing our children. We should be teaching our children how to read, write and perform proper arithmetic (what used to be called the "Three R's"). We certainly should not be spending our education dollars teaching our children anti-capitalism, anti-semitism, or the glorification of a person who killed an officer of the law, was sent to prison, escaped and then fled to Cuba to avoid completing her sentence for having committed a capital crime. Also, our schools are not meant to be indoctrination factories for the BDS movement. Put a stop to the proposed Ethnic Studies proposal immediately. And while you are at it stop trying to hide what is a hate mongering proposal behind such an innocuous name as Ethnic Studies.
