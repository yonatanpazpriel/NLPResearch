I am a former California Certified Teacher, as well as a product of California Public Schools. My children are also graduates of California Public Schools. I now have five grandchildren in California Public Schools. I am deeply disturbed by the model curriculum currently being reviewed by The State of California, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am appalled that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. In all the years I have been involved in California Public Schools as a student, teacher, parent I never had an educational experience where any country, including Russia, China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Syria etc. were singled out for such unfair treatment as Israel.
`The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism.' Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism and ignorance of the Jewish people raising, shame on the people who put this curriculum before your committee. Their own bigotry is showing. With deep and sincere anxiety, Respectfully, Ynid D Finsten Palm Springs, CA

Glossary � includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. Page 234 � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Page 234 � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country. Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 256, 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders.
