From: Rochelle K. Jackier, resident of Irvine, CA
I am addressing my reaction to the proposed ethnic studies curriculum for CA schools to be reviewed by the State of CA. In theory, I believe the concept of educating young adults about the diversity of our country which is a melting pot is an excellent endeavor, however, but not the proposed curriculum which is political and biased in several ways to which I refer specifically below. The curriculum openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am disturbed that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. `The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism.' Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. Glossary � includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. Sample Lesson Plans Page 234 � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Page 234 � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 256, 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

As a parent, grandparent, a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division.
Please feel free to email me a response at skomer43.
Thank you.
