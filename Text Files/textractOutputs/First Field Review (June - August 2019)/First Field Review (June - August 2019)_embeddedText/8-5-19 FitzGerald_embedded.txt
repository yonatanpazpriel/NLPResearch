I am opposed to much of what I read in the outline and course summary documents. This program seems to be indoctrination rather than education. I take issue with the characterization of capitalism as oppressive. When I went to school, we studied capitalism, socialism, Marxism, Communism, etc., and for the most part my teachers presented them objectively and left it to the students to make judgements about the merits and deficiencies of different economic systems. There seems to be an underlying assumption that capitalism hurts ethnic minorities and that somehow imperialism is a significant factor in peoples' lives today. I fear this program will be too political and not objective. The respelling of the words like history to eliminate someone's perception of gender is just silly. This program should be balanced to present success stories and positive role models of ethnic minorities to give people some idea of hope for their futures. I believe ethnic minorities in most countries today suffer more discrimination than they do in the United States. It would be instructive so make some comparisons in that regard and discuss why that might be the case.
