This is just bizarre far left crap. It is indoctrination, the same as if I lived in Alabama, and my child was forced to pray to Jesus everyday. It is also idiotic. And embarrassing.

"Hxstory?" You must be joking.

"variously takes the forms of being interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, undisciplinary, and intradisciplinary." Who comes up with this crap? Are you trying to teach our children to write incoherently?

"xdisciplinary, loving, and critical praxis of holistic humanity." You must be on drugs. This is the kind of crap spoken by cults.

"the academic discourses of Ethnic Studies respecting students as intellectuals;" This crap is anti-intellectual. Like religious indoctrination.

"the field of Ethnic Studies remains under attack (e.g., department consolidation, lack of institutional support, threats made by those with white supremacist beliefs, blatant resistance to implementation, etc.)" Because if it is anything like what you describe in the introduction, it is beyond belief stupid. It makes me feel like you are teaching my child to love Jesus.
And I/she say this through and beyond a transdisciplinary praxis of heterogeneity lens, inculcating hxstories of marginalized idiopathy, transgressing the dominant idiom.
I pay taxes for somebody to write this bullshit?
This becomes a part of my child's "education"?
This better be a fucking elective, and not a requirement. Because it is a fucking joke.
I know education in California is bad. I had no idea it was this bad.
