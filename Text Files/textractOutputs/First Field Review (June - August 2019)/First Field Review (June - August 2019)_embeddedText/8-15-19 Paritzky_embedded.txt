The proposed ethnic studies curriculum for the state of California does neither accurately describe nor provide the history of the Jewish community in the United States and California. What it gives are inaccurate facts and anti-Semitic bias. For instance, page 1 omits any definition of anti-Semitism. However, page 2 does include definition of the BDS movement. Furthermore pages 234, 237, 243 and 256 contain information that is inaccurate. Page 242 gives biased language on the founding of Israel (lines 5157 361). There are many more examples of both bias and inaccuracy concerning the Jewish community in the United States and California. This does not reflect well on the state of California, it's ideals of equality and intellectual honesty. Dr. Adina Paritzky
