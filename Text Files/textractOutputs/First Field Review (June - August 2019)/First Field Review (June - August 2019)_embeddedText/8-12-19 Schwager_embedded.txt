This Ethnic Studies curriculum should not be adopted as it is deeply flawed, and subjects concerning history and politics can be addressed without mandating new offerings for all state curricula.
The most obvious flaw is the strong, imbalanced ideological bias rather than emphasis on independent, critical reasoning for students. Opening a course (see course introductory pages) with respellings of basic language (such as "hxrstory"), and supplementing it with obtuse critical-camp jargon ("cisheteropatriarchy," "nepantlas," "hybridities") shows the authors care more about homage to their peer base than actually engaging teenage Californians or their teachers.

What's worse, the entire program brings more disadvantage to those it would hope to encourage, especially racial minorities. A recent article on a U.S. national champion cyclist will illustrate. As an African-American from Los Angeles, professional cycling (and really any other great success) seemed like an absurd illusion to those in Justin Williams's life: "I'm not from cycling culture. I literally come from a different world. My whole life I had been told: `This is how your life is gonna be, it's going to suck, and there's nothing you can do about it.' I just refused to believe that." He ignored that narrative, overcame, and now may be the strongest road cyclist in the country.

This curriculum voices a line similar to those in Williams's youth, only it answers the challenge by implying/stating that governmental force is the best means to answering the challenge. But even a rosy view of governmental history would have to challenge this idea as, at best, one of the least effective means of inspiring a teenager of any race to take immediate steps today toward personal betterment and the attainment of great goals (unless those goals include years of critical-camp chattering).

Young people have much to learn in their early years to become kind, engaged citizens who have empathy for those different than they are. It is good to consider how best to address this as it affects the quality of life for them, their families, and everyone in our state. This curriculum, however, is not the answer.
