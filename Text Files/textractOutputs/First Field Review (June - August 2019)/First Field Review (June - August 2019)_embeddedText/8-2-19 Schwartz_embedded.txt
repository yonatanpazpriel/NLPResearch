From: Judy Schwartz Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 10:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Removal of bds , anti Israel bias
To whom it may concern, I am writing as a retired teacher in the public schools of NYC. Please remove BDS , anti Israel bias . I am referring to pages 2, 234,237, 242,256, 264-269 of your proposed curriculum! Please add lessons on American Jews , Jews who fled or tried to flee the Holocaust, discrimination in the former Soviet Union! This would benefit the students in the public schools. Thank you for your consideration. Sincerely, Judith Schwartz
