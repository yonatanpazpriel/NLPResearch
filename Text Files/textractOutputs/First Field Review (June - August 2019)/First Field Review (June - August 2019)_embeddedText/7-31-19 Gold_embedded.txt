Dear CA Dept. of Education, to teach children in your state that capitalism is racist(among other controversial opinions in your proposed "Ethnic Studies" curriculum) is pure indoctrination. Public education should be completely neutral when it comes to highly debated political topics. Plus, capitalism is what makes America so great, it's been decreasing poverty globally for decades and has created millions of jobs, etc. Capitalism is freedom in market. Peoples choices are what place them on the socioeconomic spectrum, not the idea of capitalism. Capitalism is not racist.
