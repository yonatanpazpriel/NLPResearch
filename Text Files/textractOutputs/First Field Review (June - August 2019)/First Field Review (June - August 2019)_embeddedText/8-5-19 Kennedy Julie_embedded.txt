Dear Ethic Studies Division,
Please do not allow the State Education Department to eliminate the study of Jewish people from the ethnic studies curriculum, as they've always been included alongside Hispanic, Muslim, Arab, African-American, and other "minority" communities. At a time of growing white nationalism and anti-Semitism and when Jews are being murdered in their places of worship across the country and world (e.g., Poway, CA and Pittsburgh, PA), it would be a terrible injustice to exclude Jews from consideration as a discriminated-against "minority" group. Some people would argue that Jews are the "original minority" given that they were exiled from their homeland by the Romans in the first century of the Common Era and their community has been chased, raped, murdered and pillaged around the world for nearly two thousand years. The Russian pogroms, Spanish Inquisition, and Nazi Holocaust are only three of the most well known examples of the hatred exhibited towards the Jewish people. Many other lesser antiSemitic surges have also happened around the world, including the Middle East and right here in the United States.
Thank you for your consideration.
Regards,
Julie Matlof Kennedy San Francisco, CA
