From: Bonnie Alesna Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:50 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Jews have been the subject of discrimination and oppression for years, and we definitely do not need to add any fuel to the fire. Students, in particular, will learn flawed and biased views of Israel and the Jewish people, which will add to the atmosphere of anti-Semitism which already exists basically everywhere.
I hope you can review and rewrite as necessary to eliminate any hints of anti-Semitism; our world is already fraught with enough prejudice and hate.
Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely, Bonnie Alesna Redwood City, California
