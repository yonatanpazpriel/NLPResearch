THIS PROPOSED CURRICULUM PROMOTES RACISM, BIGOTRY, SEXISM, DIVISION AND ANTI-SEMITISM! THIS PROPOSED CURRICULUM IS ANTI-AMERICAN, ANTI-CAPITALIST AND DESTRUCTIVE! THIS PROPOSED CURRICULUM PROMOTES HATRED OF JEWS AND DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL! 90% OF MY FAMILY WAS BURNED ALIVE OR SHOT DURING THE HOLOCAUST! MY HARD-EARNED TAX DOLLARS WILL NOT SUPPORT THE SPREAD OF RACISM, BIGOTRY AND ANTI-SEMITISM IN CALIFORNIA! I AM CONTACTING ALL LEGISLATORS STATE AND FEDERAL AND EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO DO ALL THEY CAN TO STOP THIS! NEVER AGAIN!
