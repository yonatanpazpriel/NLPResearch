It is laudable to incorporate historical figures from many backgrounds into curriculum so that all students can more easily see themselves succeeding in life.
However, there should be no doubt that the capitalist system has created more wealth for the largest number of people on the planet.
Because, under the capitalist system each person is a free trader, people are free to pursue their comparative advantages and this results in an ever-increasing cornucopia of goods and services. There is nothing oppressive about this system. History has shown that people of very humble beginnings have routinely become wealthy regardless of their ethnic backgrounds.
Please remove references in the proposed curriculum that paint capitalism in a negative light or link it to power and/or oppression.
Thank you in advance for your consideration.
