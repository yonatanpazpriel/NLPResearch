I welcome the announcement this week by the California State Board of Education that its proposed ethnic studies model curriculum will soon be withdrawn. The proposed curriculum was an attempt at political indoctrination of American children against the Jewish people and America's great ally, the State of Israel. It is appalling that such a proposal could be drafted and issued for public comment in any part of the United States.
The United States unequivocally supports the right of the Jewish people to self-determination and opposes any attempt to deny Jewish ethnicity or delegitimize the State of Israel.
