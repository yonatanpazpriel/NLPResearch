From: avi zechory Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum changes "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures."
Seriously? That's how you are going to teach tolerance and understanding? A biased view that does not take into account the multiple facets of the Israeli-Arab-Palestinian conflict. Needless to say that this narrow one sided position does not even consider how much damage this boycott will cause to the very same people you are trying to help, the Palestinians, via loss of work places and all benefits linked to them. How are you going to teach children to approach such subjects with open mind ad encourage research of these subjects if their "leaders" ï¿½ teachers present a biased view from the start?
Extremely poor direction by much less the unqualified decision makers.
A good indication as to whom we can refer this abomination is by the inclusion Islamophobia" and the absence of "antisemitism" in your glossary.
With very little respect,
