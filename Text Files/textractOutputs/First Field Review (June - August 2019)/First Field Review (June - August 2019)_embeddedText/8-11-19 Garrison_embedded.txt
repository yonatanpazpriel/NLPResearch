I applaud the efforts to increase the diversity of curricular ideas. I know this is written for teachers, but there needs to be a non intellectualized version for people to understand and appreciate outside of the educational system who are not privy to this unique vocabulary. It is the same mistake most educational ventures take.
I think the ideas and process of this program are exceptional and needed.
