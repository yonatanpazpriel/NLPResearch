From: DIANE ROLFE Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 2:27 PM To: IQC Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Must be Revised Significantly
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned and moved to action to read of the flawed, unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that has been proposed for the high school students of California. The curriculum appears to be incomplete and ignores the Jewish experience of the last 2,000 years culminating in the Holocaust and continuing today around the world. I strongly recommend that the ESMC be revised to be balanced, inclusive and fair to all groups who have felt the pain of discrimination and bias. Some of major concerns to the proposed curriculum are as follows: 1) Jews are not included in ethnic groups facing discrimination and hate in America today. Please note the massacres in Poway, CA and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; 2) Anti-semitism has been excluded even though 1/2 of all religious based hate crimes in the United States are directed to people of the Jewish faith; 3) The divisive and controversial BDS movement that targets Israel for destruction, is included with no balancing perspective, and 4) A song that suggests Jews control the media is included.
For 34 years I taught history and served also as an administrator and department chair for social studies in the middle schools of Palo Alto Unified School District. Before any textbook or curriculum was adopted by the state, it was always of utmost importance that the ethnic experience of all groups be fairly presented with balance and historic accuracy.
I support strongly the idea of teaching ethnic studies class, but I feel that you must make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. Thank you. Diane Rolfe Palo Alto, CA 94301
