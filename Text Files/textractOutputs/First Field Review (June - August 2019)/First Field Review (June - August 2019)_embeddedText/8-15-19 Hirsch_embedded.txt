From: Jeriann Hirsch Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Please Help!
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching ethnic studies class, but respectfully urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses.
PLEASE make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethics Studies Model Curriculum to address the concerns of all these people.
Thank you, Jeriann Hirsch
California Public School Teacher and parent of a high schooler
