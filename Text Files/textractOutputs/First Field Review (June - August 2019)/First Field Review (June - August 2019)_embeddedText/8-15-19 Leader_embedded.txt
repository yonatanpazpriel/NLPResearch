From: Lewis Leader Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies in California Schools
I am pleased that California will be taking a much closer look at its draft Ethnic Studies curriculum and that Tony Thurmond and at least three members of the state Board of Education recognized its failings. The anti-Semitism that exists and is on the rise must be a key aspect of any such curriculum and the discrimination that has been suffered by others in this state, such as the Irish, the Italians and the Armenians needs to be included. I look forward to seeing what revisions are made. A comprehensive review is needed.
