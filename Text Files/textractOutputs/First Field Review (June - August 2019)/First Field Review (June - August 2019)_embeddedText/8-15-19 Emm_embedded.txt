From: Paige Emm Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 6:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Against the Ethnic Studies current curriculum
My name is Paige Emm, I and a high school history teacher. I am for an ethnic studies class as I think it is beneficial to so many of our students, however, I am NOT for this left- dominated curriculum. I fear that the public education system will take a financial blow with many families choosing alternate ways of education.
Revise the bill please
California Citizen, Paige Emm
