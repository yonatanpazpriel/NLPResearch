This proposal is a disgrace....there is no logic in it.. math does not foster white supremeicy, rather it teachers criticial thinking skills. Your proposal teaches a social agenda rather than social studies. Why dont you just stick to the basic, reading,writing and arithmetic? No dont answer.. the answer is obvious...
