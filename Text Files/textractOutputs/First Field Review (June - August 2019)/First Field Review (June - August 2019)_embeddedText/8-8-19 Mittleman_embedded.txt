From: Richard Mittleman Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 2:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I understand this proposed Curriculum favors the Anti-Israel, Anti-Jew BDS movement. If I have to explain why BDS is immoral, I am wasting my time as it should be obvious to any decent, non Leftist, non Antisemitic person. But of course that doesn't include those who ruin, not run, the public school system in California. Since I care that Israel is the only free, democratic, pro America state in the Middle East, I vehemently oppose BDS being a part of the proposed curriculum. You might also want to include something in the curriculum about Antisemitism which I understand has been omitted. California is already losing population and if this curriculum passes as proposed, the outflow of people from the state will increase and even more children will be pulled out of the public schools. I am thoroughly disgusted with what has happened to this once great state in the last 40 years. And no, I am not a racist.
