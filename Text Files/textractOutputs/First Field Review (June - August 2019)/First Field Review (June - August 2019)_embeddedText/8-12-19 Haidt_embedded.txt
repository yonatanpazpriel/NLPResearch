From: Frieda Haidt Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 2:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethic Studies nModel C
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am upset by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I strongly request this change which is consistent with my background.
I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Frieda Haidt
