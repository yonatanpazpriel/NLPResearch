But don't expect to find this or similar information about anti-Semitism in the draft of a "model curriculum" for teaching ethnic studies in public high schools in California. There's a long list of the kinds of hatred that have oppressed minority groups in California, including bigotry against Muslims and transgender
people. All of the items on the list belong there, but anti-Semitism is curiously missing.
