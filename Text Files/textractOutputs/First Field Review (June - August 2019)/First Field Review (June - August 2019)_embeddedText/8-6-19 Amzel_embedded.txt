I'm horrified by the proposed curriculum for the state of California, which is full of blatant an implicit bias toward Jewish people and Israel. As a Jewish family in Berkeley, our children suffered through years at Berkeley High of unrelenting anti-semitism and antiIsrael bias. The Jews are a minority and have suffered discrimination and been scapegoated since the earliest time in our world's history. This must be shared, our students educated on the history of the Holocaust to stop the rise in anti-semitism in this country. Anti-Israel sentiment has no place in State curriculum. Save that for an elective class on Middle Easter politics.
