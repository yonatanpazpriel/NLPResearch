Hi, California students deserve so much more than this proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum. In its current format, it requires a comprehensive overhaul. The writers of this curriculum have a weak awareness of American History, and an even weaker knowledge of the Jewish-American diaspora. The US has a long history of being cruel and vindictive to immigrants. Despite the Statue of Liberty and its welcoming words, there have always been obstacles to gaining admission and no ethnic group has paid a higher price than the Jewish people. In fact you could say: Jews pay the dues, and everyone else gets into the club! When the Jews were new arrivals to the US in the first half of the 20th century, there were NO diversity programs, NO affirmative actions programs, nothing to help Jewish students adapt to this strange new land. Signs in front of hotels, restaurants, and even entire neighborhoods read: "No Coloreds. No Jews. No Dogs." Those were sorry times. As to Israel, I would compare the Jews' reclaiming Israel to the Chumash Indians reclaiming Santa Barbara, Hopis reclaiming Arizona and the Sioux reclaiming South Dakota. How do we know that these tribes have any historical claim to those areas? Archaeology. Dig anywhere in Israel (including the West Bank) and you'll find Jewish artifacts from the past, because Israel is the indigenous home of the Jews. Go there and see for yourself. Incidentally, Israel is 30% Muslim, so ALL charges that it is an apartheid state are bogus. PLEASE, if you are committed to educating California's youth, first educate yourselves. Thank you.
