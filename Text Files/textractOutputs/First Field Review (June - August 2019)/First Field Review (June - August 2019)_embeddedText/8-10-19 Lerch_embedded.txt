To Whom This May Concern, Are you aware that if there was no Judaism there would be no Christianity or Islam, but if there was no Christianity or Islam there would still be Judaism? You cannot be Christian or Muslim because they are based on Judaism, sorry to deflate your balloon.
Are you aware of the contributions that the Jewish people have made in the development of the US?
What is being proposed is no different than what the arab nations did to the Jews after the inception of the only Jewish state.
Please don't be upset with Israel because they won't lay down and let the barbaric palestinian arabs murder them. Don't be upset with Israel because the Jewish people won't get bullied any longer but most importantly don't try to change history by erasing it like the left is trying to do with the removal of confederate statues.
Israel provides for the world and you are trying to compare them to the vile radical Islamic regime that boasts of rewards for the murder of innocent people. There isn't an hour of any day that goes by that the people of Califonia are using something that has an Israeli thumbprint on it. From flash drives to components in all of your devices, voicemail to firewall, the list is endless.
You should be ashamed of yourselves
