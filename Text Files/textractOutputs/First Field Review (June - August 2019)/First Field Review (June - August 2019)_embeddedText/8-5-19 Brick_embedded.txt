Page 2. This is absolutely unbelievable. This is essentially encouraging students to riot (dismantle, resistance) based on race. You are encouraging racism with this nonsense. All races have made contributions to this country. Where in this curriculum are the overwhelming number of positive contributions that citizens of European decent have made to this country ? You need to completely trash this entire ethnic studies model and start over. I'm not suggesting that you ignore or gloss over the racial injustices that have occurred during this country's history. Our history is filled with them and students should learn about them. But the emphasis needs to be on continuing, and improving upon the progress that has been made in race relations, not presenting a picture like we are back in 1965 again and active revolt is required. That sort of mindset only makes things worse. Better to encourage students to move toward a society where the color of their skin truly does not matter. That a society where everyone is treated equally (including white people) is a much stronger society.

Also the whole thing with capitalism being evil is also absolutely absurd. You completely missed the mark with document.
