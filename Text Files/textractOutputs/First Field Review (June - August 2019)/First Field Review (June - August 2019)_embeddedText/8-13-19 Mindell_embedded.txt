Just wanted to commend you and your entire group for continuing to exceed California requirements as a state that is completely and utterly full of shit. Your antisemitism is both obvious and completely unjustified but, again this is CA and I know that in CA we are a state full of Democratic haters of Jews and everything Jewish.
It won't be long before me, and so many other taxpayers, will leave this state so that you can continue your hatred of all things economically, morally and ethically good. Then, without a tax base to support your brainless beliefs, maybe the state will finally go under --- as it should.
Until then, though, please continue your unending attempts to destroy anything and everything good about this state.
