This entire proposed curriculum, (which I looked over thoroughly) raises a few questions. Missing from the groups listed for study are Christians. Why is that? America was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. Where is the opportunity to learn more about that? The entire text replaces the word "history" with "hxrtory". Why? This is a word not found in any dictionary, reinforcing the clear fact that this is yet the latest agenda-driven effort to force extreme views down the throats of our children with no options for the kids or their parents to opt out if they oppose to it.

This course of study is similar in concept to the uber-radical sex education curriculum that was recently adopted, one that (among other unbelievable things) which promotes oral and anal sex as acceptable options to consider for birth control. According to who??? Why were parents never allowed to vote on such an radical proposal or at the very least allowed to opt out of it?

It also seems there is a clear effort in this "ethnic" curriculum to demonize capitalism, a core element in the success story of the United States. Why is that and what, exactly, does capitalism have to do with ethnic studies beyond affording immigrants to America an unparalleled opportunity to achieve success? Despite the largest budget for public education in the country, California has repeatedly ranked in the lower tier of K-12 public schools nationwide. I would like just one of the people who come up with curriculums like this to explain how they address our students' low proficiency scores IN ANY WAY.

The more socially-driven programs that are forced upon our children, the less time they have to learn skills that they'll be able to use in their advanced education. We have a large percentage of kids coming out of our high schools with pitiful levels of skill in reading, writing or math. Why isn't anything being done about THAT?

Ethnic studies would be best addressed in college level courses when kids are mature enough to understand it and have enough education to decide for themselves whether they agree or disagree with what's being taught. Teaching it in elementary schools serves as little more than an indoctrination into radical socialist philosophy.

That my tax dollars are being wasted on this state's education system while it continues to fail to measure up in the real subjects of math, English and science compared to the rest of the country is distressing, to say the least. This is why I will do all I can to help my two grown children that still reside here ensure that none their children (my grandchildren) ever set foot in a one of this state's public schools.
