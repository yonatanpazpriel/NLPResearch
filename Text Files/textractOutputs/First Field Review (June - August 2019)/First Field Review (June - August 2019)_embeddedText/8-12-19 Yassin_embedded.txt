Dear CRIFD Personnel:
As a former university and as a grandfather of children in the California schools, I have great concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for its anti-Semitic and anti-Israel biases. it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. After reviewing the curriculum, I feel that it is truly anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist. The goal seems to be to denigrate the state of Israel. It is politically motivated not educational. In light of all the hatred in our country and the increase of white nationalism, this curriculum promotes more hatred and incites more harm and perhaps violence against a particular race and religion. I implore you to reconsider the entire program and the dire effects it may cause.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Yours,
