From: Beth Forsman Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti Israel proposed curriculum Unacceptable
Please understand that the proposed language used to address the conflict between Israel and Palestine will endanger Jewish students. Jews are an ethnic group who have been persecuted for centuries. That needs to be clearly recognized without any anti Semitic rhetoric as is the case in this draft. Promotion of BDS is not acceptable in class lecture or in class texts.
