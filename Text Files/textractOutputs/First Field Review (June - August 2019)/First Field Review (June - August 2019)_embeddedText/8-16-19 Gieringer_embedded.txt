The neologism "hxrstory" is based on false and misleading etymology. The first syllable of history has nothing to do with sexual identification. It derives from the Greek historia, a feminine noun meaning investigation. Students should indeed be taught to investigate the past, not accept cutesy, unpronounceable, presentist neologisms.
The suggested curriculum neglects to mention important systems of power including socialism/communism, democracy, and monarchy, which have their own histories of involvement in minority repression and/or slavery. The list of potential significant figures is notably short of countervailing minority voices such as Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, etc. This curriculum is obviously politically slanted and needs fundamental revisions to meet acceptable standards for use in public schools.
