My comments:
This "ethnic studies" is inherently divisive and political � please focus on teaching our children the strong academics they will need, not political indoctrination. Reasons?
1. California ranks dead last in high school graduation rates � dead last! 2. Yet our spending per ADA is 22nd. Looks like our system is extremely inefficient. 3. Less than 60% of our spending dollars go to the classroom � no wonder education attainment is
poor. 4. California has roughly $1 trillion of unfunded pension liability, some of which accrues to
educators/administrators. Why doesn't the state deal with a real problem? 5. The draft document describes "capitalism" negatively, but does not compare it to the available
choices (socialism, dictatorship, communism, etc.). Context is everything. 6. Is this literature so weak you have to cite criminals as sources of inspiration? 7. How about socioeconomic context:
a. Immigration � if it's so bad, why are people worldwide clamoring to come to the U.S.? Perhaps talk about that.
b. Marriage rates � lots of literature on the impact of marriage and 2 parent families on poverty and education attainment. Use the data in your analysis.
c. Addictions/Crime � what is the impact of this on the lives of our citizens? d. Cultural impacts � why do some cultures (e.g. Asian countries) do so well despite having
to overcome obstacles?
This is way too big a subject for "ethnic studies", and way too complex for K-12. You are doing no one a service, least of all your targeted ethnicities in implying they are victims and can't succeed. Teach them well and get out of their way.
