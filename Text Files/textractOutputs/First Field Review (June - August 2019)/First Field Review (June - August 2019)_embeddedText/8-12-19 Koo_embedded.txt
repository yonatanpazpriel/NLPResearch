I am requesting that the commission review the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. Please consider the recommendations made by the California Jewish Legislative Caucus and other groups.
The omission of Jews from the ethnic groups mentioned and the exclusion of Jews from the hate groups listed does not accurately reflect the real world. There is no rebuttal to the claims made by the BDS which results in a one sided view of this issues they raise. Students need to receive balanced information on issues they are learning about and by only giving one side they are not empowered with critical information they should have to take an informed position. The extreme emphasis and the definition of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions are one sided and don't include other perspectives.
The Jewish community's longstanding struggle against discrimination is not addressed in the curriculum and the issue of anti-Semitism is excluded even though half of all hate crimes are against Jews.
Adoption of this curriculum in its current format will perpetuate misinformation and tensions between opposing sides on this issue. At a time when are nation is struggling with lots of problems, we need to do what is necessary not to spark a fire between opposing sides.
Thank you for your consideration.
