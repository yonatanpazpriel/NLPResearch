From: am levy Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 7:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Deep concern
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is deeply troubling--not only for its shocking omission of any mention of Jewish Americans or anti-Semitism or its blatant anti-Israel bias and praise of BDS, but for its clear attempt to politically indoctrinate students to adopt the view that Israel and its Jewish supporters are part of `interlocking systems of oppression and privilege' that must be fought with `direct action' and `resistance,' California lawmakers have begun to raise alarms over the proposed curriculum, the result of a 2016 law calling for the creation of a model ethnic-studies curriculum by the state's board of education. What are you doing to address this bias,
Sincerely,
