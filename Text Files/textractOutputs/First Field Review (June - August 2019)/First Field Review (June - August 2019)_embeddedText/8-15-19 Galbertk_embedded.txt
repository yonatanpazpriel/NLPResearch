One of our local newspapers ran an opinion page headline "Reject far-left ethnic studies curriculum." Topics in the proposed program need to be placed in a healing context and not divisive a divisive one. As put together, this report will be divisive and lead to further fracturing of our state along tribal lines. The context needs to aim at healing wounds for past problems and how these problems were overcome to the betterment of the entire country. Everyone has been discriminated against at some time. I was discriminated against because I had a Ph.D. This was not a societal issue. The discrimination was by individuals who did not know how to make use of the different talents that I brought to the workplace. All the Ethnic Courses as proposed will do is emphasize differences and stoke dislike between people with different backgrounds. For example, we fought hard in the 1950's and 1960's to get rid of school segregation as a society. The fact that some colleges are encouraging and allowing self-segregation is an indication that the academic approaches to Ethnic Studies have been failures.

The proposed Ethnic Study courses should have been designed to help heal wounds that have been caused by historical actions. It appears to have been written with the opposite goal in mind. My first observation is the entire proposed document is filled with jargon and propaganda from the left. The first indication of this is in the third line of the introduction is the jarring use of the word "hixtory" instead of history. You should not "turn off" a large percentage of the taxpaying population by using jargon that is acceptable in academia but is not acceptable to the parents and taxpayers you wish to persuade. I taught introductory physics at a CSU and use of professional jargon would have created an almost impenetrable block to learning.

Paragraph 1 in the introduction is a particularly offensive. The assumption of a white power structure is a leftist mime that does not take into account the struggles that are still happening between all the different groups. My great grandfather fought in the Civil War to free the slaves. Our citizens of all colors are still working to free slaves in Africa and Asia. How dare you minimize the sacrifices of those still working for freedom. It sounds as if the people writing this report are not grateful for all that has been done by our ancestors to bring us to the be freest and most prosperous county on the face of the earth. If the "white power structure" is so powerful, how did the experience politician supported by the "white power structure" and the Washington political establishment lose to President Trump?

This document describes how cultural differences will be emphasized without presenting the framework into which the differences must fit. Let me use the following statement as an example. "The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression,
including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, that continue to impact the social, emotional, cultural,
economic, and political experiences of Native People/s and people of color." This paragraph breaks our society into more than 9 different groups that have, in the mind of the authors, grievances against our current society. Instead of having people grateful that they are citizens of the greatest, most tolerant nation in the history of the earth, the flaws in our society are being magnified. It is a continuation of the Howard Zinn philosophy published in "A Proctologist's view of the United States." We do not need another grievance approach. The Ethnic Studies proposal attempts to make a utopian society. All such attempts have failed miserably in the past and led to dystopian societies under an authoritarian dictator. This is what has happened under each and every attempt to get a socialist utopia which includes all the Communist and fascist countries.
Nowhere did I find a discussion of whence the word "Slave" came. It came from the fact that the Slavs were the original slaves in Europe. This is a contextual item which is needed to show that people of color were not the only ones who needed to overcome economic and cultural problems. The fact that many of our major corporations have non US born "brown" citizens as CEO's shows our current approach of promoting on merit is working. My suggestion is to scrap the current academic exercise. It will in the long term fracture
California and our country. I suggest you put forward a program that covers "Problems
in Democracy." The emphasis should be healing in the future instead of dwelling on real
and imaginary slights in the past. As a country, we must be doing something correctly as
proved by our country being swamped by people of all races and colors trying to come
into the country without permission. Purely academic solutions never work.
