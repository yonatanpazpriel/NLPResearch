The ESMC recognizes 6 groups for ethnic studies: African American, Asian Americans, Latino/Chicano Americans, Native Americans, Arab Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Why these groups? What are the criteria?

About 3% of Californians are Jewish, why aren't they recognized? Plus there are at least 150,00 Israelis in California who are Jewish, but often identified as a separate ethnicity. There are more Jews and Israelis than Pacific Islanders ( 0.6% of Californians), but Pacific Islanders are recognized in the ESMC, but Jews and Israelis are not. Why?

Jews and Israelis are subject to Anti-Semitism. According to the California Department of Justice and the ADL, anti-semitism has increased by over 20% in the last year. Why is anti-semitism not referenced in the ESMC?

Anti-semitism is too common, e.g.: - the "Tree of Life" synagogue shootings in Pittsburg, 11 killed, others injured

- the shooting at a Chabad Center in Poway, California, 1 dead, others injured

For a list of major incidents, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_attacks_on_Jewish_institutions_in_the_United_States

San Francisco State's Hillel (Jewish Student Organization) was not allowed to participate in the February 2017 Know Your Rights fair on campus, a program supposedly open to all religious groups. For years, SFSU leadership has condoned anti-semitic behavior on campus.

For months in 2017, White Nationalist terrorizes the Jewish citizens of Whitefish Montana with an electronic "troll storm" .

There are many instances of Jews being subject to extra scrutiny or kicked out of committees, student government, etc. For example, in 2019 all the Jewish women in the leadership of the 2019 Women's March were removed from the leadership team.

And this doesn't count incidents such as when a man yelled "baby killer" at me when I was walking to my car wearing a yarmulke in Berkeley.

Jews have made many contributions: Jews founded many Silicon Valley companies (Apple, Oracle, Google, etc.), Jews have been leaders in politics (ex-mayor and Senator Diane Feinstein, ex-Senator Barbara Boxer, current Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti), in banking and education (Isaias Hellman was a key Los Angeles banker, civic leader, U. C. Regent and USC founder), Walter Haas of Levi, Straus, and Company, etc. The term "Arab" is not defined. Some of the "Arab" part of the document only concerns Muslims, but there are also Christian Arabs � are they included? And the ESMC in places talks about non-Muslim Arabs. A clear definition is required. "Palestine" is not a country or state. I"Palestine" is used to refer to many different areas, a precise definition is required. "The west bank", "Judah and Samaria", and "Gaza" are all well defined. After World War I, the British gained control of much of the area as "the Palestine Mandate". However, � of the territory was eventually split off to form Jordan in 1946, and the United Nations split the remaining � of the Palestine Mandate into a Jewish state (Israel) and an Arab state, Palestine. Due to the war in 1948, the Arab state never became a state.

The ESMC is supposed to promote inclusiveness and not attacking others. However line 683 specifies "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement for Palestine" as a potential social movement to research. BDS is inherently racist and anti-semitic. The BDS leaders want to eliminate the state of Israel, although they usually don't say that directly in English. BDS proponents sometimes say: "From the borders to the sea, Palestine will be free". This means the elimination of Israel. The Jews were mistreated in the past in Arab countries, leading to a mass expulsion/exodus to Israel, much of it in secret or via bribery of Arab leaders. There is no reason to expect anything better in the future.

Line 4950 repeats "Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel".

It is not clear exactly what the goals of BDS are. They attacked SodaStream (home carbonizer of water) for having a factory in the West Bank and hiring Arabs to work in it (at better than typical West Bank wages). So SodaStream built a new factory in Israel and closed the West Bank factory, and thoe Arabs lost their jobs. Is that a success?

Also actress Scarlett Johansson resigned as an international spokeswoman for the Oxfam charity after appearing in a TV ad for SodaStream due to a difference over BDS.

Also, do the proponents really want to Boycott? Are they willing to forgo much of hi-tech which is partially designed or manufactured in Israel?

Line 4949 is: "Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter" I have googled "Direct Action Front for Palestine" and Google finds no matches. What are you referring to?

Line 4951 is: "Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico" I can't imagine what this is about. The situations are totally different. 4967 Helen Thomas Why is she listed? If/when you add anti-semitism to the ESMC, she would be an excellent example of a person with long buried anti-semitic biases. 4985 Nakba 5152-4 "hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War)." This is the Palestinian view and ignores the thousands of Jews killed and displaced. 5001-2 I'm not sure what this is leading to. Latino immigration from Mexico was mainly by foot. Arab immigration to the United States was by ship or plane. 5022 Only Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq are listed. Yet there was a major immigration from Egypt. Why is it excluded?

5022 & others - When the map is filled in, what is Israel-Palestine? That is a made up name. The Arab countries are encouraging map makers to leave Israel off maps. When the map is filled in, include labelling Israel, or include a separate map showing Israel and its neighbors. 5159-5161 The term "Arab" is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.

That is not a good definition. What truly makes someone an Arab? Will the students know whether someone from Iran is Arabic?

The songs are very anti-Israel, especially 5785, 5794-5797 and 5813-5814
Palestine is not recognized as a State by the United States. It would be better to talk of the Palestinian Authority
