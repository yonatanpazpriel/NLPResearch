"Arab Studies" is under-inclusive - As written, there are references that fail to

balance, or even acknowledge perspectives, outside of the Arabian-centric view of

Islam.

Remove reference to BDS
Remove: Direct Action Front for Palestine Call to Boycott Divest and Sanction Israel Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico Add: Study of narratives and history of Mizrahi/Sephardic Jews and Palestinians Historic cross-cultural cooperation and conflict in the Middle East including SunniShia, Druze, Yazidi, Turkish, Copt and Jewish communities Influences of Seljuk and Ottoman Empires on the Middle East History of Zionism history of Anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the United States Add historical figures of Sephardic and Mizrahi descent: FASHION - David Sassoon, ENTERTAINMENT - Max Azria, Hank Azaria Natalie Portman, Haim Saban, Jerry Seinfeld (parents were Syrian Jews), PHILOSOPHY- Maimonides, Baruch Spinoza, JOURNALISM - John Berman (CNN), POETRY- Emma Lazarus, GOVERNMENT Haym Solomon (First President of Continental Congress), Justice Benjamin Cardozo, Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, President UN Administrative Tribunal President Meir Gabay, BUSINESS Haim Saban, Eli Harari (founder of SanDisk), While the Palestinian experience and narrative has validity, so does the Israeli narrative, and while they may conflict, they can both be true and valid at the same time. Endorsing or validating BDS, or the Palestinian viewpoint alone without a larger context of both narratives creates a one-sided viewpoint that fails to acknowledge the Jewish community's struggle for self-determination and re-establishment of a homeland.
Failing to acknowledge the broad and diverse set of cultures and religions in the Middle East and their interactions with each other, as well as with powers outside of the region creates a risk of allowing Anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and discrimination against each of these cultures into the curriculum. Anti-Semitism is still a very real issue in this country, it should be included on the list of other discriminatory viewpoints that should be addressed in this curriculum, as should Jews generally, who make up 2% of the state population and have a history of being discriminated against through quotas, restrictive covenants and other exclusionary policies.
