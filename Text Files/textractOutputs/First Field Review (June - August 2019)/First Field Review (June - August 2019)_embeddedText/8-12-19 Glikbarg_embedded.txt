I am writing to urge you to make major revisions to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.I support teaching Ethnic Studies to high school students with a curriculum that will promote inclusion and https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http3A__tolerance.As&d=DwIBaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=prL_0TsYej9-HSUmpsbjf6 IYntNF wFsnN_qZ9VVWMs&m=jB1hmgtW4_J24rrzWUe1hRXShk15xCRKMuz3QNfAj44&s=1RQK 4aWwpS6Zse6K9Q4W6uz4TCan0fKJDqMrfdxYxJ0&e= I understand it,the current curriculum being considered fails to include Jews as a historically oppressed people,and discuss anti-Semitism .These are significant oversights which must be corrected in California's Ethnic Model Curriculum. I also know it does not represent Jewish history accurately, and also makes anti-Semitic statements and innuendos.Thank you.Charlene Glikbarg.
