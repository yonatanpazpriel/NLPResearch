Having read the overview and the first couple of hundred pages of the main text and several critiques of the Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum I agree with and find the following comments and concerns worth your consideration:

Glossary Larry Kaplan

Line 322 I can find no dictionary with a definition of resistance that includes "oppressive force"
The use of "pseudo-scientists" appears to deny the history of science and how science has 312 evolved over the centuries
305 Please reference defintion - can not find another source that defines praxis as a cyclical process.
300 Control is vague and begs the question. On the face of "Net worth by race" the phrase would be an objective measure of net worth as distributed across racial groups. The concept of disparity or inequality are assumed, and if exist,
277 should be evident in the numbers 254, 291 Why are these two definitions not similarly written?
