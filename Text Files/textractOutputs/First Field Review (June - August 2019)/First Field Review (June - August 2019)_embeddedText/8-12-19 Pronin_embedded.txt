General

Barbara Pronin I am appalled and saddened at the ESMCs total omission of the Jewish

people's great contribution to humanity, its inclusion of hurtful Jewish stereotypes, and the lack of any

discussion of anti-Semitism, which we all know is on the rise as are other forms of terrorism. I sincerely

ask the ESMC to re-think and revise the model to reflect a truer picture of Judaism and the part Israel

plays in keeping democracy front and center in a hostile Middle East. Thank you.
