[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] With reference to Pages 2,234,237,242,256 and pages 264 through 269
of the new Ethnic Studies Curriculum, this new curriculum openly promotes hateful boycotts of, divestment from and sanctions on the State of Israel. It omits any reference to preventing antisemitism as a form of bigotry. In addition it will promote a terrible atmosphere on all school campuses which can become physically dangerous for Jewish students. This has been shown to be the case on some university campuses. It prevents inclusiveness of all ethnicities and religions on campus by specifically targeting Jews and Israel. This was how the eventual Holocaust started in Germany in the early 1930's. Furthermore, it has been proven that boycotts only make things worse for the people they are intended to help. This curriculum is extremely un-American, hateful and harmful to all people in California and the U.S. and cannot be defended by any moral standard. I respectfully ask you to please change the curriculum by removing any and all references to Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel and include American Jews as an ethnic group in this state and country. Thank you.
