Thank you for a rigorous, critically engaged, and carefully designed model curriciulum. This was no easy task. I especially appreciate the work around "education debt," "inquiry-based approaches," ethnic studies as an analysis of power, and that ES courses should have a community engaged project to utilize their knowledge and affect social transformation. Given the huge scope of this curriculum, I will focus my comments particularly on Asian American studies. If you would like to contact me about any of this, please feel to email me at fujino@ucsb.edu. Note 3 combines high school ES requirements and ES course offerings. These are two very different structures and ought to be separated. There are at least 13 districts in California that require ES for h.s. graduation, including Santa Barbara SBUSD, passed in November 13, 2018. In SBUSD, ES courses (Black Studies, Chicano Studies) have been offered since at least the 1990s. Before the requirement was passed, 3 ES courses were offered in the district: Chicano Studies, Mexican American Literature, and Social Dialogues. note 3, after line 129

I agree with the importance of teaching what ethnic is and pedagogical approaches to teaching ethnic studies. I also agree with the need to teach the history of the development of ethnic studies. For an article on the current California-based movement to gain ethnic studies in the high schools and collective models of organizing, see Diane Fujino, et al., "Circles of Organizing: Collective Leadership, Social Relations, and Intergenerational Activism in Ethnic Studies Now! Santa Barbara," Kalfou: A Journal of Comparative and Relational Ethnic Studies 6 (2019): 73-86. Page 34 Migration � a rigorous approach to connect so many different kinds of migrations and discussions of colonialism/settler colonialism: Atlantic slavery trade, to internal migration, to war refugees. Good to include environmental migrants today, or migrants arising from environmental catastrophes Page 40.

On the model minority myth, in addition to discussing the problems with the model minority myth, it'd be important to understand how and when and why it emerged. It was popularized in the 1966 Petersen article (page 165), but emerged in the earliest years of the Cold War. According to scholars, the global context of US expansionism in Asia was crucial to turning Japanese Americans (as enemy turned model citizen) and Chinese Americans into "success stories." The model minority trope served to reduced global and domestic charges of racism in the U.S. that served to buttress the U.S. as a paragon of democracy and expanding the US's global reach, in addition to disciplining Black protest and protest in general.

There is certainly room in this curriculum to address Asian American activism, and doing so fits with the curriculum's focus on social movements, agency, collective organizing, and some of the specific topics on Asian Americans. Given the model minority trope, discussing Asian American activism is particularly important and for too many, unexpected. The inclusion of Asian American activism would also provide many opportunities to include a racial comparative or relational analysis and open to discussions of the meanings of solidarity, including Asian American relations with settler colonialism in Hawaii.
