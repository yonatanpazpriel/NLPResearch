From: Jan Olandese Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 5:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The Model Curriculum for Ethnic Studies
Hello:
I was appalled to learn more about your model curriculum for ethnic studies from the LA Times Op Ed by Karen Klein and other news sources.
It appears to ignore Jews, which seems incredible considering the rise in antisemitic hate crimes including two synagogue shooting incidents. I agree with Klein that the language used (cisheteropatriarchy, anthropocentrism and hxrstory) quite exposes the biases of the authors of this draft.
Please worry less about political correctness and more about common sense. Please put the brakes on this draft and start over.
Sincerely, The Rev'd. Jan Olandese, M.Div.
