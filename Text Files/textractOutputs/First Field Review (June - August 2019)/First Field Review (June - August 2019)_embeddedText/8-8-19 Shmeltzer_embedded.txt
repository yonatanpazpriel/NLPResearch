I'm worried that the proposed content is going into the Israeli/Palestinian/ Arab topic in what seems to be a very one sided view. This conflict is very complex and can be viewed and explained from multiple perspectives, but the approach taken in this curriculum seems to be very one sided and not at all objective. In fact it seems to be very anti-Israeli in this context. I would rather see a curriculum that focuses on the internal American issues. Some examples to the topics that worry me are below
Further more - the curriculum doesn't mention Jewish ethnicity at all. It ignores the current rise in antisemitic activities in the US that target Jewish communities across our nation. (Including horrific armed attacks on synagogues). It doesn't mention the Jewish communities and the plights that caused them to seek refuge in the US.
The combination of ignoring the Jewish ethnicity while singling out Israel (the Jewish state) as the single global issue raised in this curriculum is very disappointing and worrying.

Page 35/36 - the inclusion of the BDS movement ,which focuses on a political issue outside of the US here is not appropriate. Every other organization on the list is focus on issues that are internal to the US - so keep it US focused. Singling out this specific movement rather than movement that deal with other political conflict (for example the Free Tibet movement) smells of singling out Israel vs any other country in the world.

Page 233 - the mention of the border wall between Israel and the Palestinian territory is again out of place singling out Israeli issue in what is suppose to be a study of US internal issues. It is worth mentioning here that the border wall was erected to help prevent the frequent suicide bombings that Palestinian Terrorist organization inflicted inside Israel - and indeed once in place the border wall drastically reduced the number of such attacks.
Page 241 - The reference to the war between 7 Arab nations and Israel and the results of it as "The Nakba" is again taking a one sided view of the situation. There is no mention for example of the fact that many Jews were deported from Arab countries (with some of them seeking refuge in the US as well).
There are further references in this chapter - all are very one sided.
