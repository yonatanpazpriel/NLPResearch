From: Magan Hartman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:53 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on ethnic studies model curriculum
I am extremely concerned about key portions of the Arab American section of the ethnic studies model curriculum. As a Jewish American, I am concerned that this curriculum's treatment of Israel, Palestine, and BDS will subtly but firmly indoctrinate California students with a biased viewpoint that is not only offensive but dangerous, as can be seen in the rise in anti-Semitic acts right here in our state and on our college campuses. I will not feel comfortable subjecting my daughters to such a class.
