I would cite page and line numbers, but they are so numerous, that I am offering a general objection to the entire curriculum. The entire project is an abomination and I would add that a normal person would think it was offered as an April Fool's joke. When so many California students are not being taught the basics of how to read, how to write, how to do math, how to understand sciene, as well as how to think critically, the State of California has embarked on this ridiculous endeavor. The premise of this proposed curriculum is based on essentialism, which is a discredited philosophy, such as Marxism and socialism--two other schools of thought which have been tried and failed, over and over again. The proposed curriculum appears to take a pre-Enlightenment point of view. The curriculum is rife with made up words. This is the height of idiocy, with so many students just struggling to speak proper English. California schools should try teaching civics--which would encompass many aspects of Ethnic Studies. A good grounding in civics would give students the tools to be able to effect change in society, which appears to be the objective of the Ethnic Studies curriculum. The level of ignorance of civics and our system of government among students is alarming. All California students need to understand the foundation of our legal and political system--the

Constitution. This is the governing document of our country and if they were well aquainted with it, they would be able to become leaders and have an effect on the society. With the Constitution, other document such as the Declaration of Independence, the Federalist Papers, etc. should be studied. For instance, I only learned recently, after a lifetime of study in the law, that the first Declaration of Independence contained a long excoriation of slavery, written by T. Jefferson, but it was edited out-- because the drafters had to unanimously consent, and some of the other writers did not want it included.

Along with the founding documents, the students should study the structure of the government and our economic system. As I alluded earlier, the socialist and communist experiments have been abject failures, resulting in either economic depredation for citizens, supporting tyranny and subjugation of them, or both. Look at the real life examples and facts. The capitalist model has resulted in the greatest improvement in the lives of people the world over. How about a cross-comparison of the heralded Scandinavian welfare state models versus the U.S. version of capitalism? You'll find the facts show that Scandinavian countries are in fact very capitalistic, and their high tax rates support various welfare state programs. Sweden in fact has total school choice. Denmark is paring back its "social security" pension plans (because of the cost) and instituting a private 401K type model. Private health insurance is advancing in countries like Canada & Denmark because of the waiting times in the public "free" (high tax) health care sector. Please teach these children the facts of life, not the falsehoods and fantasies of some out of touch, misinformed education "experts."

These children need to be educated; they need to learn to think critically. What is being proposed here is educational malpractice. This is why

California needs to emulate Sweden, and have total school choice. Then, parents could protect their children from the insanity that is being pushed in the public schools. As a matter of fact, I sent my child to public school for K-6, and then to private school for the rest. The K-6 was perfectly fine, for the most part. However, I knew she would be exposed to nonsense, especially in high school. So I sent her to a very fine private school, and I am so happy I did. Her (average, not AP) math and science classes there were more rigorous and difficult than what I experienced in college. I am grateful daily for the education she received there. Of course, the teachers had opinions they tried to push sometimes through the curriculum, but since she learned how to think, not what to think, she was able to process various points of view and come to her own conclusions. She is light years more educated and successful as a person than many of her public school peers, who were fed pap such as what is being proposed here.

Please, I urge you to reconsider this proposed curriculum, and return to sanity. Perhaps you should study curricula and school systems that actually work, like Finland's.
