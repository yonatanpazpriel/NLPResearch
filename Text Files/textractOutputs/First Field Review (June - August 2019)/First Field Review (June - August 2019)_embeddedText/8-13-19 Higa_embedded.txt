Thank you very much, in advance, for considering my opinions.
In my opinion, as a non-partisan senior citizen of color, the most critical problem with the K-12 education of California students is the absence of American civics and U.S. Constitution classes. Ethnic studies classes, which I took at UCLA, as an undergrad, should be taken post-high school, electively, with the emphasis in K-12 placed on the basics, in my view.
I thought that Common Core was supposed to be about firmer grounding in commonly-accepted general fundamentals, not indoctrination with a partisan political/social agenda, one that could even possibly promote despicable, hateful, and evil anti-Semitism. From what I have read and experienced, students seem to be even less knowledgeable, comparatively ("Holocaust study: Two-thirds of millenials don't know what Auschwitz is" by Julie Zauzmer on 04/12/18 at https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http3A__washingtonpost.com&d=DwICaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=w8z0depm2w5HR Zyqv_KOh5qQ_mYSRm-7t0heKgwZG8&s=eqjpsxR1utmOPYWvFhpmc0Ir0eZeJe2KTAdo_j6EeII&e=) despite technological advances since my K-12 student days, and are even more poorly prepared than ever before for the most challenging future that is to come, as far as I am concerned.
Thank you so very much again for allowing me to offer my opinions.
