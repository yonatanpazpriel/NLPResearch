Why is there no mention of Anti-Semitism anywhere in the description of ethnic studies curriculum? It is something that has certainly been in the news and has played a role in numerous incidents over the years. I believe it is as important as, if not more important, than Islamophobia in our current climate. Ellen Ben Basat
