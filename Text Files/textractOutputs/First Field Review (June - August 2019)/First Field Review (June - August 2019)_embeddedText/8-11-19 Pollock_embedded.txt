This curriculum presents itself as helping students to deepen their appreciation for cultural diversity and aid in eradicating bigotry, hate and racism. But the curriculum excludes anything about American Jews, who are the target of the most hate crimes of any ethnic/religious group in the US after the African-American community according to the latest FBI statistics. American Jews can not be considered "privledged" when they must post armed guards in front of their synagogues, religious schools and community institutions.

Sanctions movement against Israel, and Direct Action for Palestine, while

providing no critical views of their perspectives.

A false equivalence is promoted that equates Israel's efforts to stop

terrorists from crossing its borders to murder innocent people, and U.S.

policies on the border with Mexico.

Ambiguous language is used to imply that "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is

Glossary

The Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War is presented as fact without explaining that for the Jews it was a war for self-determination and independence. Encourages teachers to use a poem harshly criticical of Israel, but offers no positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders
BDS is described in laudatory fashion without any discussion of alternative view, such as that its goal may be the eradiction of Jewish sovereignty, thereby denying the Jewish pepole the right to selfdetermination in their historic homeland.
