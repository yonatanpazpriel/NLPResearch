To whom it may concern,
The State of California is currently reviewing a model Ethnic Studies program which openly promotes boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. Disturbingly, this agenda was inserted into an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities. Moreover, despite its stated purpose, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism
Please reconsider Thank you, Deborah
