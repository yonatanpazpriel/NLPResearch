From: D Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 7:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerns
I am deeply concerned that the "BDS" movement is considered a movement toward "whose aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice." A lot of people I speak with, liberals and conservatives alike, feel that BDS unfairly singles out Israel as sole blame for the conflict, and this can (and shown by history on UC Campuses, will) lead to anti-semitic belief systems. Do Jews not count as being part of the "Ethnic studies" of California?
1) This whole thing is making my fiancee and I look into private schools, here being Hmong, me being White/Jewish, she follows all the stories, and already worries about anti-semitism towards our future "Half-Jewish/Half-Hmong" biracial kid.
2) I am not a Trump supporter, but you do realize that this stuff is what drives all of the swing states towards Trump, and away from the Democratic party, right? Moderate swing states will see this, NOT want this, and vote for Trump, just like in 2020. Just some friendly advice from a lifetime Californian...
I appreciate an honest response to my concerns, as a small business owner supporting me and my Asian wife, I also don't believe Capitalism = Racism.
