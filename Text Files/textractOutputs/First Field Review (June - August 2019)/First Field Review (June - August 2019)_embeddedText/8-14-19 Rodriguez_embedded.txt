I feel that it is extremely important to have an ethnic studies requirement which brings understanding to all people about the history of historically discriminated against cultures especially as it pertains to California and its history. In many ways ethnic studies is a large part of the creation of California and its evolution to present day. It is vital that our population be educated about ethnic studies and the roles all have played in the evolution of CA, especially those cultures that were systematically marginalized. This course of studies will serve to create an informed citizenry that can flourish not only at home but also among communities of all cultures as our students learn to engage and respect the contribution of all for the good of society. Ethnic studies curriculum should move forward without delay, given its importance. Thank you.
