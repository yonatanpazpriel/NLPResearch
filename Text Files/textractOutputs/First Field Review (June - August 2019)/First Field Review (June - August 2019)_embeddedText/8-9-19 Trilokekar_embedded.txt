From: sumukh trilokekar Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 6:11 PM To: CFIRD Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
This Model curriculum reflects complete ignorance of historical facts. Israel is the only multi ethnic democracy in the entire middle east and has over 2 million citizens of "Palestinian" origin in addition to the Arabs under PA control in Judea and Samaria. Perhaps the California Dept of Education would like to do better in using tax payer dollars to educate our children about the US Constitution and the responsibilities of adult American Citizens to our own Republic.
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
