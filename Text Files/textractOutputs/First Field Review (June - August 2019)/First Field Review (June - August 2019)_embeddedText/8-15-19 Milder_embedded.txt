I commend the state for implementing an ethnic studies curriculum. An essential part of that curriculum should be the role of Jews in California's history and the place of the Jewish community as part of California's cultural diversity. The absence of attention to the Jewish community is a shortcoming of the curriculum. I am disappointed to learn that anti-Semitism will not be given due attention, alongside other forms of bigotry about which students should be educated. Page 242, line 5160: I object to an unfair, unbalanced portrayal of the State of Israel. Descriptions of Israel as engaging in apartheid, and describing its founding as a catastrophe, are politically biased judgments. They fail to explore the significance of Israeli statehood as a national liberation movement of the Jewish people, vital to the security of Jews, and a direct response to centuries of persecution and genocide against Jews. That understanding is essential, if Israel is to be discussed in an ethnic studies curriculum. Page 269, line 5803 The depiction of Jews controlling the press is a blatantly anti-Semitic trope, and has no place in promoting understanding of diversity and combatting bigotry.
