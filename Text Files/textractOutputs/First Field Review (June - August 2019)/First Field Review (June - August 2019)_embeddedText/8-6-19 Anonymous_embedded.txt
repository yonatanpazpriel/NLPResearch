Please include Jewish ethnic groups (Ashkenazi, Sephardi, Mizrahi, and other groups) as an ethnic group in the curriculum. In terms of hard numbers, we are a small ethnic group, comprising only roughly 2% of the United States' population. However, we have been a cohesive ethnoreligious community in the US for generations, interacting with other minority ethnic and religious groups and collectively enriching the US with diversity.

As we are currently erased from the curriculum, I would like to ask that we are included- we are experiencing heightened white supremacist violence at this time (there have been two massacres within the last year, at Poway and in Pittsburgh), and in this time of vulnerability, we need more than ever to be seen as human beings worthy of respect and inclusion, no more or less than anyone else.

Mizrahi Jews (Maghrebi, Kurdish, Iranian, and Jews (including Sephardic Jews) from Arab states, etc.) must be included in some way in this section (Line 4290). Jews are one of the oldest ethnic minorities in the Arab world, and have lived in, been oppressed by, and contributed to Arab culture(s) for millennia. Their story is integral to the history of the MENA region and its diaspora, and not including this in the curriculum would be a major failure.

Over 200,000 Jews of Mizrahi heritage live in California. They, like all Jews, are a minority group vulnerable to antisemitism, and are inheritors of a cultural patrimony that continues to make California (and the rest of the US) a culturally richer place through diversity. Please demonstrate your respect for this by including Mizrahi Jews in the curriculum.

Chapter 2 No business or other (Line 4957) organization affiliation.

Please represent the Israel/Palestinian conflict in a balanced and impartial way. Currently, the curriculum reflects only a support for BDS (and by extension a condemnation of Israel as a national home for the Jewish people). Most American Jews believe that while we have an ancestral claim to the land of Israel, as the place of our ethnogenesis, that in no way means that the Palestinians do not have an equal claim. To erase our connection to our ancestral homeland is a disservice to the State of California's stated goals of inclusion, diversity of opinion, and balance.

The curriculum must be balanced, inclusive, and reflective of multiple perspectives. Please ensure that where the conflict is taught, the curriculum reflects a diversity of perspectives.
