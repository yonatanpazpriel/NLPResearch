From: Rabbi Denise Eger Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 9:07 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on ethinicity curriculum
To whom it may concern:
I am writing on behalf of my community of more than 300 households of our synagogue to say we strongly and vehemently oppose this new ethic studies curriculum. It is clearly highly biased. It is anti Israel and antiSemtic.
The language used to delegitimize Israel is shocking. The pro BDS language is outrageous as it is a movement dedicated to the destruction of Israelis and the state of Israel. And is used to taunt Jews on college campuses throughout our state. See what happened at UCLA as but one example.
This curriculum is offensive as it omits any mention of Jewish ethnicity or discussion of AntiSemitism alongside other racism and homophobia issues. Who wrote this appalling mockery of an educational curriculum?
Let's ask students to learn about the diverse people of California and their proud histories. Let's learn how to combat racism homophobia misogyny and AntiSemitsm, and classism. But this curriculum is not up to the task. It is meant to be inflammatory and one sided and this should be shelved. Shalom,
Rabbi Denise L. Eger, D.D. Congregation Kol Ami Past President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis.
