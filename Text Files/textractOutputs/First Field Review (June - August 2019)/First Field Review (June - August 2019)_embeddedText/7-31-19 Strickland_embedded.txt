I am a concerned Grandmother in California . If curriculum goes to socialist ideas and against capitalism my family is wholly against it. Capitalism has made America great and is helping the world today. Please stick to helping our children in reading and math proficiency as we are deficient . Thank you for your attention in this matter. The Strickland Household
