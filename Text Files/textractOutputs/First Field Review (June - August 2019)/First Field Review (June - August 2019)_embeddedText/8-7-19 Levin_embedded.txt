[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. In my own family, I have been told my paternal grandfather's family fled the pogroms of Russia, my aunt seeing with her own eyes her 14-year old childhood friend murdered by the Cossacks. My paternal grandmother came to America from Poland with only her brother, never to again hear from her parents or other family members, likely exterminated in the Holocaust.

Page 2: line 29 "B" and 30 through 40: Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel. Promotes continuing division and hate against Israel with no voices critical of their perspectives. Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) that promotes continuing hate and division. This is discrimination against Israel for protecting citizens against those in the Middle East who publicly state their intention to wipe every Jewish person off the face of the earth. Israel attempts to prevent her own annihilation cannot be compared to South-African-style apartheid. Israel shows great restraint in every effort to spare innocent human life, both internally and of those whose governments continue attacks against the nation.

Line 239: Definition of Islamophobia. No mention of anti-Semitism.
Page 234 line 4947-4958: Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Pg 234 line 4957: Encourages BDS with no voices critical of that perspective.
Pg 237 line 5030: The land is Israel, not Israel-Palestine.
Pg 242 lines 5158 to 5161: To balance what the Arabs called the Palestine War, consider instead: "Israelis and their supporters have traditionally referred to the conflict as the War of Independence, seeing it as a defensive war to prevent the destruction of the fledgling Jewish state in the face of overwhelming Arab aggression." https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/israels-war-of-independence/ Pg 268 line 5792: "Free Palestine" is again making Israel the oppressor when it is Arabs who want to annihilate the Jewish race. Arabs are unjustly using their own people groups as pawns to further certain socio-political agendas. Pg 268 line 5802: Again, mischaracterizing Israel as an apartheid state. It is not. No comparison. This is propaganda. Islamophobia: 60 mentions throughout the document. 0 mentions of anti-Semitism.
Overall, your ethnic studies curriculum is highly flawed. It offers an apologetics course promoting one viewpoint throughout at the expense of any other. In the case of Israel, this nation is not an apartheid state. Israel urges compassion instead of conflict, negotiation instead of forced compromise at the risk of the total annihilation of her people worldwide. I urge you to reconsider.
