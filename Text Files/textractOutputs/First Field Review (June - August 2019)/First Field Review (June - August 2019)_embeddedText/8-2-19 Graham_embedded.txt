So many examples of bias in this curriculum.This curriculum openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry.
� [Glossary, p 2�The characterization of BDS is at the very least, provocative, and at most it is untrue. Palestinians are NOT living under apartheid and for you to use the Palestinian definition is unconscionable and unbecoming of an educational institution. It parrots BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which, in my opinion, seeks to end Israel's existence.

Page 234: Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but includes no voices critical of their perspectives Page 237: Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Also, refers to Israel as Israel-Palestine. This is not a factual description of the region. Page 242: On this page you frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives It also encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders

Introduction

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing

General

Nowhere in the curriculum that I can see does it talk at all about Jewish immigration experience, the Israeli experience where they are bombarded every single day by bombs and terrorism perpetrated by Arabs. This curriculum appears to be have a one-sided agenda .

Please add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
