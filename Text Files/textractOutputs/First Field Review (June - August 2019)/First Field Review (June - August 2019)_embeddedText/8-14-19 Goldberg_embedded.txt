General Comment: The model curriculum is highly objectionable and highly charged on many levels. The curriculum revolves around the real or perceived grievances of four basic ethnic groups (Hispanic, Blacks, Native Americans and Arabs) which the curriculum blames at various points in highly pejorative terms on "oppression and systems of power" and "settler colonists" or, in the case of Arab-Americans, Israel.
Rather than teaching America's youth that Israel was created after WWII to provide a Jewish homeland and haven following the Holocaust, the curriculum describes Israel's founding as a catastrophe and introduces the horrid anti-Israel BDS movement. Teachings like this de-legitimize Israel and teachings that delegitimize Israel foster anti-Semitism. Perhaps no ethnic group has had more historical persecution than the Jews yet the Jewish-American experience does not appear to be a story the curriculum drafters seem to think is important.
The curriculum does not mention that virtually the entire world's Jewish population lives in only two countries. The roughly one million non-US non-Israel Jews live in Europe where anti-Semitism is never far below the surface. More and more Jews are leaving Europe for Israel every day. It is beyond argument that Israel's existence is of existential importance to Judaism's survival.
Nor do the drafters seem to think that experience of other ethnic minorities, like Italian-Americans or Irish-Americans or Polish-Americans or Catholic-Americans are important enough to teach our youth about.
In my opinion, a curriculum like the one developed here can only lead to further radicalization, alienation and ethnic division not unity in the United States. We should tailor a curriculum that builds up and celebrates America's unique immigrant story, not one that tears down America. We should teach patriotism not parochialism. The proposed curriculum is heavy on the latter and extremely light on the former.

I strongly urge that this entire enterprise and curriculum be rethought and reimagined in more constructive, and less destructive, manner. I still believe that America the last best hope of mankind and I dearly like our future population and leaders to cherish not despise America.
