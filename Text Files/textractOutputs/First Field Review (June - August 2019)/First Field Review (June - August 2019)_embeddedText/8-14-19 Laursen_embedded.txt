I'm sorry to not include page references for your convenience, but my thoughts follow.
Capitalism is described as a "form of power and oppression," alongside "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy" and "ableism." Excuse me, but Russion communism, North Vietnamese totalitarianism, Japanese imperialism and some of the current African countries are much, much illustrative of power and oppression than capitalism ever was. Capitalism is not racist! Capitalism has raised the standard of loving of more people of all colors than any other system in history. Calling it a form of power and oppression, white supremacy or racist is a total contradiction of the truth and an immense distortion of fact. Teachers are encouraged to cite the biographies of "potentially significant figures" such as: Angela Davis; Frantz Fanon; Bobby Seale; convicted cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur; Puerto Rican nationalists Oscar Lopez Rivera, a member of a paramilitary group that carried out more than 130 bomb attacks, and Lolita Lebron, who was convicted of attempted murder in a group assault that wounded five congressman. These are role models only for violence and should never be upheld for positive recognition.

Housing: Politicians imposed lower underwriting standards on the home-loan industry in a well-intentioned, but misguided, attempt to help such home buyers. Republicans said it was a way to expand the middle class while Democrats said it would aid the poor. Subprime loans were NEVER an attack on home buyers with low incomes. Such a claim rewrites history, but does not tell the truth. This curriculum explicitly aims at encouraging students to become "agents of change, social justice organizers and advocates." Teachers are directed to have students plan "a direct action (e.g., a sit-in, die-in, march, boycott, strike)." There is something horribly wrong when Ethnic Studies promotes having students stage a die-in! Obviously, teaching objective history isn't the goal. Rather, it's training students to become ideological activists and proponents of identity politics. This objective is entirely inappropriate for, and should never be taught in, our public schools.
