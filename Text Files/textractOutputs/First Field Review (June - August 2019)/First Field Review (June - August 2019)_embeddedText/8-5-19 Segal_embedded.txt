The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. This seems especially problematic, since there is a strong emphasis on the BDS movement which seeks to eradicate Israel. It is important to provide both perspectives to allow students to have a full picture and to reach their own analysis and in particular ideas about how to end bigotry, hate & racism.

Page 2, ln 30-40. The glossary includes a "definition" for Boycott Divest Sanction (BDS) against Israel. The definition is far from neutral, instead claiming the movement's purpose is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" and continues to present a biased definition without providing any perspective of this campaign of hate that seeks to end Israel's existence, which I think is the most critical aspect of the BDS movement. This omission makes this entire definition dangerous and misleading to students who may naively believe in the movement without understanding its underlying ambitions. P. 234. Creates a false equivalence between the US action at the Mexican border and Israel's efforts at its border to protect its citizens from terrorists seeking to murder them. P. 234 Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and its supportive group, Direct Action for Palestine, without offering any criticism or analysis of the implications of these actions. It would be like teaching about the border wall, without discussing Mexicans. P. 237. Ln 5030. The use of the term "Israel-Palestine" in this context suggests that is it a single Arab country. P 242, lm 5157-5163. Provides a very narrow and one-sided view of the formation of Israel and the 1948 War without any perspective from the Israel side. Pp. 256 & 264-269. Encourages the teaching of a poem that is very harsh on Israel without providing any opposing view and without providing any similar criticism of Palestinian leaders.
