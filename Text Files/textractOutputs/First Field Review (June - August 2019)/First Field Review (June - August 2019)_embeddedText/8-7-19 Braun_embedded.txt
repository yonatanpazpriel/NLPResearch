From: Sandra Braun Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 11:28 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: 2020 Ethnic Curriculum
I am a mother of three boys that went through our wonderful public system education. I am terrified of the new ethnic studies curriculum being proposed for our schools. Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel. Sincerely,
Sandra Braun
