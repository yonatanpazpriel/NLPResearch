From: Frank Ariel Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:22 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: I urge CFIRD to adopt Safeguards to ensure that state-sponsored curriculum is not used for political indoctrination for or against any group
Dear CRIFD Board Members,
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I have children attending LAUSD school now and I don't want them to be indoctrinated by any group's ideology.
I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Frank Y. Ariel, Attorney at Law
