From: Carol Weinfeld Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 5:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Thank you for listening to our concerns.
As a teacher, parent, and part of the Jewish community of Orange County, I appreciate that our concerns are being addressed. I am grateful for the acknowledgement, however without a seat at the table for the revision discussion and re-write I am concerned about the out-come. For those of us experiencing the rise of anti-Semitism and the denial of the State of Israel this curriculum is very important and accuracy is a must, please consider giving us one seat on the advisory committee. If you would like a few suggestions on who that might be, I would be happy to provide some names from our community who are level headed.
Thank you, Carol
