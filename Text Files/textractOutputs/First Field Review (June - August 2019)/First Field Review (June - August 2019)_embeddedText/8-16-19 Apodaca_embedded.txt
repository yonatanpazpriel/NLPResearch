I am a 64 year old MD who went to public school K thru 12 , North High Torrance , and UCLA, then Harvard med. Being pre med I didn't take any history or Poli sci, and didn't learn anything about the Palestinian- Isreal conflict until I was out of school in my 40s
Teaching about what could be the nidus of WW 3 is important and sorely overdue. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE don't bow to pressure, teach about the Middle East conflict and enlighten kids who would otherwise be ignorant . Many will find out later anyway . Teach it frankly and accurately and the world will be a better place (eventually ). Continue w the ethnic studies program as planned and don't CAVE . D Michael Apodaca , MD
