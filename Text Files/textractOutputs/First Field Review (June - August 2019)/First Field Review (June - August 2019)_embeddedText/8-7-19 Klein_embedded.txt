I have come to understand that there is a biased definition of the BDS movement in the new draft curriculum guide, as well as the absence of mention of several Middle Eastern ethnicities that live in California, including Mizrahi Jews. As you seek to refine the document and its guidelines, please consider that some important information has been left out--information that can directly impact how students form opinions and begin to understand the strife of many peoples here in this nation. BDS must be represented from both a pro and con perspective. And please consider, would you ever want your own ethnic narrative erased from the learning and lectures our next generation will be exposed to? Please strive for more coverage, of more peoples, instead of limited, hateful (and damaging) tropes. Thank you.
