What I have read is disturbing, to say the least. Teaching accurate ethnic history is good and necessary, but this curriculum appears to be mostly liberal and socialistic propaganda! Much of this perpetuates the "victim" mentality. Our kids do not need this! They need to be presented the facts without all the commentary! As is, this will only cause further division among races and the LGBTQ population. After teaching (only) the historical (and often disturbing) facts about our history, the focus should be on the fact that this is in the past, most people in America have moved past racism and classism, and anyone and everyone is capable of rising above their circumstances to become a successful member of society. As to making up your own vocabulary... Hxstory? Really! I had to type it numerous times because my phone kept autocorrecting to the CORRECT spelling! I urge you to make DRASTIC revisions to this one-sided curriculum. By the way, I am an Educator.
