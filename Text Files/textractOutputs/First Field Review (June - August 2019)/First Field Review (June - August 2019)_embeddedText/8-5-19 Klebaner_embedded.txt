I am very concerned about the proposed addition to the curriculum and how it portraying Israel and Jewish community in general. Open support of BDS and other anti-Israeli sentiment is not a healthy dialogue unless both sides of the issues are given equal time and treatment. As a proud Jewish immigrant to this country and a patriot of the United States, I feel the Jewish-Americans should be equally covered in the text book to provide healthy balance. The way proposed issues are presented will only increase anti-semitic rhetoric in these already polarized and dangerous times in our country. My children are born, raised and educated in California schools. I do not want them to feel threatened or marginalized which is inevitable should you allow this type of "teaching" be included in the curriculum.
