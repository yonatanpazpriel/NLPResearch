The bill the Calif Legislature is trying to pass to make mandatory for students to graduate is not supported by parents. When do the people get a say concerning all these bills they are passing thru to educate our children??????? It is filled with Ideology and political activism. Teach them about history and those who layed their lives down for our freedoms and STOP pushing SOCIALISM!!!!!! Sent from my T-Mobile 4G LTE device
