From: Peggy Hunt Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 5:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: STATE MANDATED ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
After reading an article yesterday about the proposal to require all students graduating from high school in the state of California to complete a course on ethnic studies, I have given this topic some thought. This state has been on the road to diversity for at least two decades now, and all that has come of that goal is to create division. Rather than focus on what people share in common, the focus has been on what makes people different from one another. I don't know about you, but when I make a new friend, it's always based on something that we share in common, and never about what makes us different. Diversity Divides.
Rather than forcing high school seniors to complete a boring course on ethnic studies, would it not make more sense to instead include projects throughout the educational career of students that are geared towards sharing religion, music, customs and food with fellow classmates and then identifying what each shares in common. By focusing on shared values and shared likes, it is much easier to draw people from different backgrounds together.
Another suggestion is to drop the finger pointing, shame of ancestry, and "educationese" from this proposed curriculum. Unless it is truly the goal of the State of California Department of Education to program students to be good little proletariats, I strongly suggest you pay heed to this suggestion. If it is the goal to head down the path of political dictatorship/socialism/communism, then be prepared to see a mass exodus from public schools, as well as from California.
Sincerely,
Margaret E Hunt
