I am a Pediatric Dentist, a small business owner. I am also the mother of 3 daughters, a wife, and caregiver for my mother. In my career I have employed over 20 other women. I provided healthcare for the women on my dental office who needed it. I served indigent patients mostly Latino and African Americans. Capitalism was the system that enabled me to serve my staff, my patients, and provide for my family. My whole life has been devoted to providing opportunities for women of every race and socioeconomic background. When my patients or staff had problems I was them for them. I am a capitalist and my father who lent me the money to start my dental practice was a capitalist, a dairy farmer, and a WWII vet. In light of my experience, I can say without a doubt that this curriculum is nonsense. Spend your time teaching children math, reading, how to write and speak so they can succeed in life rather than wasting their time on this propaganda. Dr Rebecca Hamner
