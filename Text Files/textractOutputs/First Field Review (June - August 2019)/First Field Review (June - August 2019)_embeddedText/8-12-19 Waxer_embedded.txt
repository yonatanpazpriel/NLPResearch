How can an ethnics studies class not include anti-Semitism and the Jewish experience as a minority in America? You don't even define anti-Semitism in your Glossary. There were quotas at colleges, places that didn't allow Jews in America until the 1950s and today, attacks on Jewish students, synagogue shootings, swastikas, marches in Charlottesville, gay woman kicked out of a Chicago Gay Women's parade for wearing a Jewish star. Is this not oppression of a minority? Even now, while there were 273 incidents against Arab-Americans there were 938 incidents against Jewish-Americans (recent FBI statistics). Anti-Semitism is on the rise in Europe and never left the Middle-East. Why emphasize the Arab-American experience which has not been that bad? This is just a reaction to Trump, whose anti-Muslim ban is obviously temporary, as Trump, at most, has 4 more years. But this course will be required to graduate from high school in California for all time? For a temporary political situation?

Why is the California Department of Education supporting the BDS Movement anyway? The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is decades long with problems on both sides. Palestinians are NOT Israeli citizens but outside hostile neighbors. When Clinton tried to make a peace deal Arafat walked away from it and started years of terrorist bombing (the intifada) � that's where the stereotype of Palestinians bombing and wanting to kill Jews came from � it is true in the Middle-East. Granted, Palestinians have not done this in America. The intifada blew up street buses, girls standing in front of discos, family seders, schools, etc. This forced Israel to build walls to keep Palestinians out and that worked. In another peace try, Israel left Gaza. The Palestinians picked Hamas to lead them because Hamas promised to fight Israel, which it did. It bombed neighboring Israeli towns. Lately, Hamas sends burning kites into Israel to start wildfires. Imagine if Mexico sent burning kites into San Diego to start wildfires?! Every peace attempt by Israel has been met with attacks, because Palestinians interpret "niceness" as "weakness". It is not the job of the California Department of Education to pick a political viewpoint and teach it to all the children of California as dogma. The purpose of the class should be to teach about different groups so people get along. I agree it is useful to expose system problems that keep groups back, like red-lining and deeds not allowing sales to minorities, so people know a group's lack of money/power is not their fault, and the system problem can be fixed. Part of the class should be how to fix the system problems instead of wallowing in grievance feelings.

Having students listening to and creating rap songs referencing "free Palestine" as a class project just promotes hate. Why is anti-Semitism and dislike of Israel being taught in class as a project, anyway? Why isn't hatred of Saudi Arabia for its treatment of women being taught, since the class talks about oppression of women, too? Where is that rap song? How exactly are you going to deal with oppression of women on the one hand and Islam's view of women on the other hand? Who decided that Israel would be attacked, but not Saudi Arabia (or Islam in general) for its oppression of women, which is at least as bad as the oppression of the Palestinians? Isn't this just a political fad? Many religious books (Christian Bible, Koran) have anti-Jewish statements that children are taught at home. The purpose of school should be to counter any hatreds children learn at home so that Americans can all get along. This class reinforces anti-Jewish religious statements as valid. There is no mention of the vast contributions of Jewish-Americans to America at all in this class. Science, art, finance, law � nothing. The class makes Jewish-Americans invisible in America � and Israel this bad country that we're all supposed to hate and make rap songs about. Jews are a minority (3% of California). Why are they not in an ethnic studies class? Jews are an ethnic group (a community or population made up of people who share a common cultural background or descent). How come Armenians and Indian-Americans aren't represented? Who picked which groups get represented in this class? Why aren't ALL ethnic groups represented in this class � especially since this is a required class?

This class is based on temporary fads. It is obviously a reaction against Trump, who will only be president for, at most, 4 more years. It picks a side in a complicated fight (BDS) without any background exploration of both sides (which would at least educate students in conflict resolution � i.e., FAILED conflict resolution). Maybe a project to come up with a solution would be more useful than a gratuitous rap music project (also a current fad) to express feelings of grievance and hope that Israel is destroyed. Is this a class where people learn something or do they just emote about how they are oppressed? How does that help America to encourage teen grievance feelings? This class will send kids home aggrieved as victims. How is America helped by creating depressed teen-agers taught the system is against them? Make a "meet-and-greet" class where you learn about other groups, and learn how to fix system problems (redlining) rather than be victimized by them. May I suggest instead of dwelling on grievances, students should listen to Muslim-American comedians (Aziz Ansari, Hasan Minhaj, Maz Jobrani, Kumail Nanjiani, for example) talk about their experiences as immigrants but with a positive, I got through this, narrative. Also, since most people haven't even met a Muslim (I haven't), it is a nice intro to Muslims (much like the Will and Grace show introduced Americans to gay men). Please do not create this course. It will force Jewish students to go to private school for their own safety (very pricey). It will cause fights between students of different ethnic groups. It promotes a victim mentality amongst already depressed teen-agers in America. It divides everyone by ethnic background instead of bringing us all together as Americans. It erases Jews from American history. It increases White Supremacy as everyone hunkers down in their oppressed groups. Whites will do that too.

I feel sorry for the teachers who will have to manage all the arguments and hard feelings this class will create, which will then carry through into the school and American society in general. You can already see the effect of people identifying by their group instead of as Americans on our society today. Return to teaching Government classes (which you stopped doing) where students learn how to work the political system, get bills passed, find out who has the power to do what, learn what's in the Constitution, etc. That would create a better America than this class. It would create free people who solve problems instead of mobs of aggrieved victims looking for vengeance.
