I whole-heartedly support CDE's proposed guidelines for including Arab Americans as a distinct and marginalized group in our state. As a Jewish American parent of a child who was educated in the San Francisco Unified School District, I know how important it was both to her as a student, as well as to our entire family, when Jewish holidays and experiences were highlighted in her classes. I would want no less for our Arab and Muslim neighbors.
