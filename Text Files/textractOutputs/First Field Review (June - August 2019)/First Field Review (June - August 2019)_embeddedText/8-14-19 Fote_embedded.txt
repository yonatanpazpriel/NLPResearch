General---You must stop teaching this leftwing ideology!!! Father figures are not racist.
Capitalism is not racist!!! Stop trying to indoctrinate the youth into radical left wing. Education needs to remain free of the bias. California is becoming a laughing stock to the rest of the world. You should be teaching the youth about America's greatness.

Stop!!!!!!!
