Professor Raul ArtalMittelmark, M.D.
Holocaust Survivor

While the goal of introducing Ethnic Studies to our California Schools is admirable, I must take a very strong stand against the total omission of any reference to the Jewish experience in America, to the long standing persecution of the Jews, and to Anti-Semitism. I am a Holocaust survivor, I was born in a Nazi slave labor camp, many of my relatives were murdered because of anti-Semitism. Between 1933-1940 more than 1,400 anti Jewish laws were passed in Germany, resulting in the death of 6 million innocent victims. By ignoring anti-Semitism and the Holocaust the California Board of Education curriculum is clearly on the footsteps of Nazi Germany antiJewish stand. Furthermore, by providing misleading, biased, inaccurate history, and by advocating positions of anti-Semitic organizations such as the BDS, it inflames young minds and could result in increased anti-Semitic and violent actions against the Jewish people. I strongly protest the currently proposed biased and anti-Semitic curriculum.
