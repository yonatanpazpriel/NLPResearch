I am fine with having ethnic studies as part of the curriculum, but this model curriculum is awful! This may be what is in vogue right now in university ethnic studies departments, but it's not a useful curriculum. A public school curriculum for ethnic studies should teach about the different ethnic groups living in California: their history, their experiences and their cultures. This model curriculum, however, seems intended to promote a particular, far-left ideology of identity politics and intersectionality. A majority of the people of California disagree with this ideology and it should not be taught in the public schools.

I gather that "hxstory" is meant to take the "his" out of "history," but if so, it's a term based on ignorance. The etymology of "history" has nothing to do with gender -- it comes from the greek word for knowledge.

I agree with the accusations I've read in the media that the curriculum is antisemitic. BDS has nothing to do with ethnic studies and is divisive. It is not an appropriate sample topic.

Overall, I find the curriculum to be very negative. Rather than focusing on oppression and discrimination, why not instead focus on understanding the history and culture of various groups and religions in California? Students are more comfortable with people different than themselves when they know something about them.
