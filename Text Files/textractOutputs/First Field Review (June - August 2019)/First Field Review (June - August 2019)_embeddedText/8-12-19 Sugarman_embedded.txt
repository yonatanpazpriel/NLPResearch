Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
Though I am supportive of the development of ethnic studies programs for our students in California, having read the proposed curriculum document, I am concerned that the course outline unnecessarily includes the controversial BDS in its list of "social movements" to be studied. Why single out Israel (among all the nations in the world with serious diversity problems) in this document? It seems out of place here and risks alienation of a large swath of our students. I urge the commission to revise the ESMC to address these concerns.
Best regards, Jeffrey Sugarman Los Altos, CA
