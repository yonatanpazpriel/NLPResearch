I am opposed to the ESMC. Jews are essentially eliminated an ethnic group. While bias against other groups is highlighted, the curriculum omits and meaningful discussion of anti-Semitism . The term anti-Semitism does not even appear in the glossary. Where Jews are mentioned, it is done in a discriminatory manner. For example it recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis " use the press so they can manufacture" a classic antiSemitic trope. It singles out Israel, a democracy, and the only Jewish state in the world, for condemnation based on "facts" that are out of context and inaccurate. This includes support of BDS. I object to capitalism being associated with a form of oppression. Check with Venezuela, Russia, Iran , China or Cuba if you want examples of governments oppressing people. This curriculum is heavily biased and emphasizes victimization rather than an objective account of various ethnic groups. This is heavily focused on racial identity
