Dear Committee, Attached are my comments. I had saved it on my computer, but when I went back it would not allow any more comments.
The 18 member committee is mostly from southern CA--no one from northern CA (other than San Francisco): no one from Sacramento, Chico, Redding, Yreka, Arcata, Susanville, or Alturas. This is an outrage. Please add some voices from the north.
AB 2016 directs that it encourage cultural understanding. This proposed curriculum looks at grievances, but doesn't cover great contributions made to the state by different groups. We should try to be inclusive first.
A better approach is incorporating the Teaching Tolerance lesson plans that encourage acceptance of all diverse groups (https://oneworldoneheartbeating.com/for_teachers/teaching-tolerance/). For example, some of the titles of the lesson plans from Teaching Tolerance really encourage participation and tolerance: "Claim It"--Differences & Similarities-Creating a climate of inclusion; Understanding Stereotypes; or Getting out of the Box (define discrimination and prejudice to develop action plan to heal racism).
Gender identity is NOT an ethnic group. Such study belongs in biology where the genetic mutations may be studied. That would foster greater understanding and empathy.
One gets lost in all the jargon which isn't helpful.
I wonder how such a course would be graded? One mother said her 11 year old son was told that when he took a viewpoint that didn't agree with the teacher's bias his position was wrong and he'd have to work alone as no one in the class would be assigned to work with him.
Thank you,
Kay Oring, PhD Retired Professor U. NV, Reno
