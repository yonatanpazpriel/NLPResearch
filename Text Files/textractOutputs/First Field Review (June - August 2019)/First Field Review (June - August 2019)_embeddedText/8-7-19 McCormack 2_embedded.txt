From: Cheryl McCormack Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 11:00 AM To: CFIRD Subject: Comment n Ethnic Studies Curriculum Framework
To whom it may concern:
I have attached my comments on the ethnic studies framework. I was disappointed with the negativity and lack of comprehensive ethnicity. I believe the committee would do much better or a new committee should be invited to write the framework. It seems this group is promoting certain ideologies and is not familiar with the history of the state of California.
