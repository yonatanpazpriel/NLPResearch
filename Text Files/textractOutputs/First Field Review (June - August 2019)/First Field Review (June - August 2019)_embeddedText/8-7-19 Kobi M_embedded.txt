Glossary � BDS � the BDS aim is to replace Israel with an Arab State. This entry should be removed. `Freedom for ..." is euphemism for the destruction of the Jewish State. All the rest is propaganda. "Students will analyze the political and social turmoil between Palestine and Israel" inaccurate description. It is a war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas or Palestinian organized and or individual terror. There is no state called Palestine.

Arabic Verse Rapped by Shadia Mansour � Racist hate speech and incitement has no place at school or in the public square "For every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded For each greeting, a thousand houses were demolished They use the press so they can manufacture, but when my sentence is judged, reality presents itself"

Palestinians: terrorists, blow up airlines, try to "destroy Israel" and "drive the Jews into the sea" The double quotes are misplaced. Palestinians have been involved in terror attacks against the Jewish population of Israel going back some 100 years. The Arabs also launched at least two genocidal wars against the Jews but failed. Palestinians blew up more, much much more than just airlines. Palestinian terror is responsible for destroying thousands of lives mostly Jews, but also many Arabs.
"The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War)." Inaccurate untruthful description of what was the war between the armies of Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Iraq, augmented by Arab irregulars. Some Arabs fled, others expelled, some stayed, some fought the Israelis some did not, and some joined the Jews to fight alongside them. A Jewish `Nakba' followed the establishment of the Jewish state when hundred of thousands of Arab Jews where expelled or forced to leave the Middle East Arab states where they lived since antiquity well before the Arab invasion of the 7th century CE. Some Arab Jews settled in America.
