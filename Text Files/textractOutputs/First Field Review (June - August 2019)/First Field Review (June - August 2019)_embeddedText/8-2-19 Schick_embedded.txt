inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. Furthermore the regurgitating of misleading and false historical facts with regard to Israelis and Palestinians, without presenting both sides can only add to more bigotry, misunderstanding hate, racism and violence. Bigotry, misunderstanding, hate, racism and violence that can spread to other ethnic groups and conflicts. I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. As well as the bigotry, racism, hate, discrimination, and violence Jewish immigrants and refugees experienced in the US.
