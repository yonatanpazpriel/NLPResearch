From: susanna klebaner Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 5:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Curriculum to Be Revised!
I totally agree with the letter sent by the Jewish Congressional Caucus regarding modifications to the California Curriculum.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses.
The ESMC omits antisemitism.
This is also inconsistent with, and in contrast to, the attention it devotes to Islamophobia. The most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Jewish students should not feel discrimination in classrooms or on campuses. I escaped Soviet antisemitic propaganda not to face it again in the United States. Respectfully Susanna Klebaner
