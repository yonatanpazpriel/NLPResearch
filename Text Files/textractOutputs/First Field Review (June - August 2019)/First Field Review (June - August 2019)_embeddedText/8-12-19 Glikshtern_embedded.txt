� Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
� This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America
and especially on college campuses.

� The ESMC omits antisemitism.

� This is also inconsistent with, and in contrast to, the attention it devotes to Islamophobia. The most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents.

� The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews.

� The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement.

I'm writing this comment because in less than 80 years after the Holocaust and 70 years after the establishing of the Jewish state on a small portion of the Jewish ancestral land, California Department of Education is undertaking the task of institutionalizing teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. One lesson of Holocaust is that the Jewish people would always be under the threat of the destruction, that others could not be relied upon to protect the Jews, and the only way to do so is to have an independent state. It is very sad that California Department of Education has chosen to promote BDS � a well-financed, well organized, linked to terrorist organizations movement designed to eliminate Israel � and therefore to move towards eliminating this protection for Jewish people.

Page 1. Antisemitism is absent in the glossary. Antisemitism is rising all over the world, including US - especially on college campuses. This is in contrast to attention to Islamophobia in the curriculum. To most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic. Page 2, lines 30 to 40 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) definition is completely false. It is the movement to eliminate Israel � as is freely admitted by the movement's leaders. There is no apartheid in Israel. Israel is a progressive and liberal democracy. Unlike neighboring Arab countries Israel has free elections, a free press, full religious freedom, full rights for women and minorities, including gays. In Israel there are Arab legislators in the Knesset, Arab diplomats in the Foreign Ministry, Arab generals in the Israel Defense Forces, and Arab judges. While it's true that Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank who lived under Israeli rule didn't have the same rights as Arabs or Jews in Israel, they also didn't experience anything at all comparable to apartheid. In many ways they had more rights under Israeli rule than they have today under Hamas rule in Gaza, or under PA rule in the West Bank, and more rights also than the citizens of any Arab country. The proper comparison for BDS is not with the South African anti-apartheid movement but with the boycott of Jewish businesses in Nazi Germany and subsequent Jewish laws in Germany and Italy. Many states have by now enacted anti-BDS laws, and U.S. House recently passed anti-BDS resolution on an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 398-17.

Page 8. Holocaust definition missing. Holocaust topic totally ignored. Holocaust-denial - missing. Page 234. Line 4957. Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel � see above � should be excluded � not promoted. Or, at the very least, its true antisemitic nature should be exposed. BDS uses towards Israel delegitimization (denial of the Jewish people's right to self-determination by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor), demonization ( making mendacious, dehumanizing, demonizing, or stereotypical allegations about Jews, or the power of Jews as collective - the myth about the world Jewish conspiracy or of Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal institutions), double standards (the implementation of a different moral standard for Jews and Israel compared to the rest of the world).

Page 234. Line 4958. Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico. The situations are not comparable. The subject promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.

Page 237. Line 5030. Israel-Palestine isn't an Arab country. Israel is a Jewish state (with sizable Arab population). There never has been a country or state called Palestine. Palestine is a name of the geographic region located between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River, all people leaving in the area - either Jews or Arabs - were called Palestinians not too long ago.

Page 242. Lines 5158 � 5161. The "Nakba"/"Catastrophe" is how Arabs call the creation of the State of Israel. The cause of displacement was not the creation of Israel, but the war against Israel started by Arab countries following the Israeli Declaration of Independence. This war and attacking Arab countries are the reason for the displacement. It must be made clear in the Course Model. It also needs to mention about 850,000 Jewish refugees which had to flee Arab countries in order to survive.
