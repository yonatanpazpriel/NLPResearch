Dr. Brandon Zaslow, Director of Los Angeles Area Site of the California World Language Project, Writer of the 2019 California World Languages Standards and 2020 Framework

As an expert in the area of heritage language education and a leader in the field since the 1990s, I struggle with the laudable intentions of the author team of these standards, to validate the experiences, uncover the histories, address the pain and struggles of marginalized communities of California in light of the fundamental criteria of the standards "to create space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality or citizenship, to learn different perspectives".
I fear that these standards do not create a space for white students or Jewish students.

By focusing blocks of instruction on ethnic groups, rather than on themes ("marginalization", "invisible histories", among others) and exploring how these themes are manifested in multiple groups (those identified in the standards, augmented by LGBTQ+, socioeconomically disadvantaged, women, disabled and other marginalized groups) allows a large swath of California's students to remain unseen and has the potential to create hostility among members of the Ethnic studies courses.

I might be na�ve about what needs to happen to address injustice, give voice to marginalized communities, and change attitudes and behavior. The approach we have taken in the 2019 World Languages Standards and 2020 Framework seeks to be inclusive of each and every California's student by making space for all narratives through a thematic approach. In our courses, we see the teacher as a facilitator of access to multiple narratives where themes drive collaborative exploration and provide opportunities for voice from each and every student.

In our polarized and increasingly violent world, educators need to create opportunities for human beings to connect on a deep level to our shared humanity. Connection requires openings from each and every member of a class. I ask you to consider whether the justified demands for redress of injustice in an Ethnic studies course is the best way to build the community necessary to reduce polarization and to bring more students into the human family so necessary to address the myriad challenges that face our world.
