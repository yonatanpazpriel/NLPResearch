Lisa E. Stone ADL

p.1: It seems odd to not include a definition of anti-Semitism, especially since p.2: includes a definition for BDS
p.242: Clearly politically biased language is used to refer to Israel's founding (lines 5157-61). p. 268-69: Saying Jews control the media is an old, clearly anti-Semitic trope. Saying Israel colonized land without including a context (namely of why, how and in relation to other countries) is bad history.
GENERAL COMMENT: There are more than enough mistakes of prejudice is not outright bias to tarnish the whole curriculum. I join all those asking you to save the model curriculum by carefully removing examples of anti-Semitism and any other bias, and re-writing as necessary.
