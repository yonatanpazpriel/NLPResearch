The lack of recognition of Jewish Americans as an ethnic group is completely shocking. Hate crimes against Jewish Californians rose 21% in 2018. Also hate crimes against Jews were the highest of any religious group targeted. Doesn't this warrant inclusion in this curriculum. Isn't this curriculum intended to ward off rise in hate crimes such as exactly this? There are anti semantic tropes in the lyrics of a Palestinian rapper included in this curriculum which just further exacerbated the profound lack of attention to anti semitism in this document. Page 2 references the BDS movement which is very biased against Israel and Jews.
