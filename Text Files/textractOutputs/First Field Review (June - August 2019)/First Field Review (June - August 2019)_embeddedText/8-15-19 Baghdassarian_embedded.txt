Haig Baghdassarian, Armenian National Committee � SF Bay Ara

It's certainly not my intention to diminish the importance of the specific ethnic communities (Latino American, Asian American, Arab/Muslim American, African American, Native American), as they are all worthy of inclusion within an ethnic studies curriculum. But I found it very disappointing that a proposed curriculum in the state which is home of one of the largest Armenian Diasporan communities in the world, who find themselves largely due to the first modern genocide, were not included. The significant state support for the Armenian American Museum which will be built very soon is indicia of the value for highlighting the culture and contributions of Armenian Americans. The absence of the Jewish American experience, deep ties and contributions in California was also surprising and disappointing. I hope that the IQC and State Board of Education will rectify these glaring omissions, and also consider including other groups which have comparably strong connections with our state which may be mentioned by other concerned citizens.
