From: Neal Miller Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern: I am writing to express my extreme disappointment in the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As a Jewish American with two children in junior high school and High school I am concerned that anti-Semitism is excluded from the Glossary while BDS is included. I believe the curriculum should accurately reflect the serious nature and growing threat of anti-Semitism across the world. This not only has the potential to mislead our children of real world problems, but inappropriately bias them towards a particular thought process that is dangerous. I appreciate your consideration of this concern and ask that you reconsider the proposed language/curriculum.
Thank you.
