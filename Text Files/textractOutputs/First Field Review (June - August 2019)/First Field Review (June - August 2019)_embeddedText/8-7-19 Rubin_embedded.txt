� I think that the term "antisemitism" should be included into the curriculum, Anti-Jewish discrimination continues to thrive in the U.S., and students would benefit of understanding the term and its meaning
� I think the description of BDS is necessary and important to discuss. � Including the topic of whiteness and Jews' place (and negotiation)
within it might also be beneficial
