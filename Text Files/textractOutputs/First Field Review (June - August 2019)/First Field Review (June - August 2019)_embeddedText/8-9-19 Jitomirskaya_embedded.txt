From: szhitomi Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:56 AM To: CFIRD ; Ethnic Studies Subject: A strong concern about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As a faculty in the UC system, a parent of three California students, CA taxpayer since 1991, and a former sufferer of persecution for being Jewish, I am deeply concerned by the pending bill AB 331 that pushes antisemitic and anti-Israel proposed model ethnic studies curriculum, to be used by all CA public high schools. It omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel.
I urge you to immediately establish safeguards for ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Sincerely,
