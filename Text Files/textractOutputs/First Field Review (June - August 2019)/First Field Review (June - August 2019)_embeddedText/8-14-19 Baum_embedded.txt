Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
General: I urge the Department of Education to reconsider the curriculum with regard to the lack of meaningful inclusion of Jewish history/contribution/experience in California, lack of treatment of antisemitism, and inclusion of hateful content. But equally important is for the Department consider fully how this situation was permitted to happen, and how, with regard to general curriculum development at all scholastic levels in the future, � oversight and proactive/sustainable remedial actions will be assured.

Respectfully submitted.
