Please kindly accept this general comment. I was informed about this have time to read the proposed curriculum. If the proposed curriculum acceptable to the boycotting of Israel or not including the denouncing my comments. If I'm wrong, please disregard. What troubles me is that I was raised with the idea that we should be everyone, regardless of race, color, origin, religious beliefs, sexual orie this is now obsolete and we need to treat different people differently. We need to judge everyone on their actions and not their origins. To t Israel, the only democratic country in the Middle East, I ask, do you ha Unlike Israel, China does not have freedom of speech, tortures their p totalitarian state. Are you promoting boycotting them? On the other h promotes freedom. History shows us that boycotting countries and ca lead to war. The idea of tolerating anti-Semitism and boycotting Israel sickens me g lash out at those promoting this new curriculum, I can't play their gam say that they are terribly misguided and sincerely hope that they will b this horrible mindset so that we can promote tolerance, understandin If you've read this long diatribe, you have my thanks.
