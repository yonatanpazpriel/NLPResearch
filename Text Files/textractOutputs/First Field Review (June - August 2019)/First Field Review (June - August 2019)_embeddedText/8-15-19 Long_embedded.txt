I'll get straight to the point: Our kids should be learning useful skills and information that will help them become level-headed and critical thinkers...NOT be indoctrinated into being leftist robots. This curriculum needs to be scrapped immediately. Our children should appreciate all cultures including the jewish faith. American culture (yes we have one) should be celebrated, not scorned. Students should NOT be taught to see the "white male" as the enemy. White Supremacy, while repugnant, is not a probem in this country, you are making it a problem in the kids minds and you should be ashamed.
This kind of brainwashing garbage should not be taught to our kids.
