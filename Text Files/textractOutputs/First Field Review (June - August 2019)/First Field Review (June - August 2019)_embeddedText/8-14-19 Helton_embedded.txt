From: Darrell Helton Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on proposed curriculum - ethnic studies
As a concerned parent and California tax payer I must protest your proposal to teach California students ethnic studies in any form. Immediately stop promoting this curriculum. It has no place in our public schools and I do not want mine or anyone else's children exposed to this toxic, unAmerican and evil indoctrination. It defies all the principles upon which this country was and is established. Your curriculum promotes prejudice and racism. This proposed curriculum promotes that Capitalism is negative, destructive to all peoples and therefore bad. Capitalism is not racist. It is the ONLY economic base proven to provide economic gain and improvement in lifestyle for ALL peoples everywhere worldwide. This is why people the world over are coming to America in droves. In fact, your jobs are FUNDED by Capitalism.
Your curriculum encourages students to look up to known criminals as role models. It promotes hatred of Jews and other groups. This is outrageous.
Your role in education is to teach the basics of reading, writing, mathmatics and logical, critical thinking so our children can function in this world. Indoctrination in social, political philosophy and your own personal ideology has no place in public education.
Sincerely,
Darrell Helton
