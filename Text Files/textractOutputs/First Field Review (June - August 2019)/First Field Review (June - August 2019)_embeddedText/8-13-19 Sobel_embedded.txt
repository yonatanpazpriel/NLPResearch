From: Sarah Sobel Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum CAN NOT be Published As-Is
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am shocked and dismayed by the biased proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but as a parent of three children who will be receiving this education in the CA public schools I insist you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Just a few decades ago the world said never again but this unbalanced curriculum excludes any mention of Jews as being an ethnic groups and, bafflingly, excludes anti-semitism as a hate crime/discrimination despite half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Sarah Sobel
