It is imperative that this be included in the framework. I teach 3rd-year college students who have never heard about the removal of American citizens to Mexico in the 1930s, or who never understood why their greatuncles asked every Japanese person that they met, "Where was your family?" It is critical that we include the histories and cultural memories of ALL Americans in our educational system. We are American because of, not in spite of, these histories.
