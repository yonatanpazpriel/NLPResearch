Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
We need to allow children to form their own informed opinions about the Israeli, Palestinian situation. This curriculum is completely one sided and they are deprived of learning the full story about what is going on in the Middle East. At the very least a more balanced curriculum is important not brainwashing children toward one side of the issue. This particular curriculum causing children to develop a dangerous one sided approach to what happens in Israel and can fuel increased anti Israel rhetoric in the future. Aren't children supposed to learn to think for themselves and are they not entitled to learn all the information about what happens in the middle east, not just one side of a story? I would definetely encourage more curriculum on appreciation of diversity and the struggles of different ethnic groups of religions in the face of persecution such as during the Holocaust or other events. These statements are in reference to pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of the curriculum outline.
