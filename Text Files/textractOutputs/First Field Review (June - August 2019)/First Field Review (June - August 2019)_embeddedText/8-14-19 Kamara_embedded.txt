Dear Sirs, I vehemently oppose the proposed Curriculum. It is not all inclusive. It most certainly has a political agenda which I think is dangerous for the citizens of California and the country as a whole.Please consider the source (the so called academics that claim they are knowledgeable.) Thank you . Ourite Kamara
