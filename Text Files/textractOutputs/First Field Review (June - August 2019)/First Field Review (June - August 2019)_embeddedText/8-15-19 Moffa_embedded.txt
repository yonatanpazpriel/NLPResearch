Page 3, Line 60; Page 4, Line 21; I wholeheartedly endorse the proposed curriculum's use of a critical lens to examine capitalism, class, classism, and systems of power. Too often, our public schools fail to examine or even to acknowledge the role of capitalism and corporate power in our society and civic discourse. I offer an easy example of why the proposed curriculum is necessary. The California Department of Education's website, cde.ca.gov, requires me to comment on this proposal using Microsoft Word. No phone calls, no E-mails, no open-source .txt files. Residents have to buy and use Microsoft Word, a commercial product, to communicate with their government about educational standards. No one at the Department set out to favor Microsoft, yet that is the result anyhow. Every generation needs to question capitalism anew. I fully support the proposed change and hope the committee continues to encourage critical thought and hard questions.
