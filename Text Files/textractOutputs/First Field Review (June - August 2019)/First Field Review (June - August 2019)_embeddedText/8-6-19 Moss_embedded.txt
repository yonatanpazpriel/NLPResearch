Dear CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education,
I am grateful that the State of California is creating, with the purpose of introducing, a curriculum that will present "an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."
I write to you during the public comment period of the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to voice my great concern over how this Model Curriculum fails at its mission. Instead of eradicating "bigotry, hate, and racism, this Model Curriculum institutionalizes and sanctions bigotry, hate, and racism.
I call you attention to the following items in the curriculum:
� Glossary, Page 2: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) claims the purpose of
BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" and lists BDS while failing to offer critical perspectives. In an interview with Omar Barghouti, co-founder of BDS in 2015, Mr. Barghouti stated the following: "Ultimately, BDS aims to turn Israel into a pariah." Also, "We oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine... [only] a sellout Palestinian would accept a Jewish state in Palestine."
The Sample Lesson Plans in this Model Curriculum:
� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for
Palestine, and offers no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
� Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering
Israeli cities to murder its citizens, with that of U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
� Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country
(p. 237).

� Presents only the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative
perspectives (p. 241), specifically how many Jews were expelled from Arab Countries that same year.
� Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the
media and use it to manipulate the public - a common, and false, Anti-semitic slur (p. 256, 264, 267, -269).
Even worse, the curriculum excludes Jews as an ethnic minority (currently estimated at 1.8% of the US population), doesn't list the word "anti-semitism" in its glossary, and fails to note the ongoing persecution and acts of violence committed against Jews in the U.S. and world.
I strongly urge you to remove from this Model Curriculum all anti-semitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias.
Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and Anti-semitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Arab countries in Middle East, and discrimination in the counties of the United States, the Former Soviet Union, and others.
I thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Helene Moss
