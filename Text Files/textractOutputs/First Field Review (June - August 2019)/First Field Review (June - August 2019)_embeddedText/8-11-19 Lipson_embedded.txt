From: Jafi Lipson Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:53 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Grave concerns with draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a progressive Jewish parent commited to our public schools and to teaching and celebrating the ethnic, socioeconomic and intellectual diversity that are unique strengths of our state- this draft curriculum feels like an outrageous betrayal of the Jewish community and a white-washing of the long history of discrimination and persecution that Jewish Americans have struggled to overcome.
This curriculum takes a noble aim and cheapens it into a slanted and one-sided exercise in fringe politics to demonize Israel and exclude and deny any recognition of anti-semitism while highlighting discrimination against other groups.
If adopted in its current form this draft curriculum would be a stain on the Board of Education and a betrayal of the values of the diversity that this state represents- in which Jewish and Israeli Americans are major contributors.
I strongly urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Jafi A. Lipson, MD
