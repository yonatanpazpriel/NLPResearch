From: Richard Maltzman Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond; JIAC Subject: The flawed Enthnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am a retired college professor with a specialty in learning disabilities and I happen to be Jewish, as is my husband, a retired attorney. We are both very concerned by the proposed ESMC. We support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but the ESMC as presently drafted requires major revisions or a significant rewrite or, rather than fostering understanding between ethnic groups, it could foster hate against a large minority in our country which has been a target of hate for several millenniums! I, of course, am referring to American Jews.
I understand that Jews are not even considered an ethnic minority in the ESMC, but Israel is attacked as a perpetrator instead of its real purpose as a democratic home for Jews who are being oppressed in their home countries because they are Jews.
I also understand that the most recent FBI statistics record 938 hate crimes against Jews in the United States and 273 Islamophobic incidents during the same period. I, of course, condemn hate crimes against any ethnic group, but don't ignore anti-Semitism because our President prefers to vent against minorities other than the Jews. To structure an ethnic sturdies model curriculum which leaves out anti-Semitism sounds more like 1934 Germany than 2019 California. We strongly urge the promotion of a sound ethnic studies model curriculum, but one which includes our Jewish minority and leaves out rants against Israel, the only Democracy in the Middle East.
Thank you for your consideration of this issue.

Sincerely,
