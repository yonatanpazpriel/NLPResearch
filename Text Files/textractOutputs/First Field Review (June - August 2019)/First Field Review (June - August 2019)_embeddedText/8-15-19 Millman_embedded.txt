It is clear that significant work was put into the curriculum and much of it is very good. I applaud the effort. However, the omission of the Jewish American experience and lack of acknowledgment of the existence of antisemitism seems to evidence a clear bias. Isn't that what this effort is intended to address?
Work still needs to be done before this is ready to be presented to our kids.
