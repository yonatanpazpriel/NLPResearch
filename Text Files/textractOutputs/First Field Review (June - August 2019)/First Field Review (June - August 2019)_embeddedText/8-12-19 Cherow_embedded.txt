The curriculum is not acceptable in its current form. It is inaccurate to define capitalism as a system that disproportionately exploits minorities. Capitalism is not a system which supports white supremacy, racism or patriarchy but rather lifts up hard working individuals of any background. The curriculum should not idealize the violent Black Panther movement. The curriculum should not support the divestment from Israel. Thank you Michele Cherow Sent from my iPhone
