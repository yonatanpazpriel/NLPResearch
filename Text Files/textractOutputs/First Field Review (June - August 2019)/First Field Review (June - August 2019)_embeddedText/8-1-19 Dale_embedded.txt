From: Karen Dale Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 3:07 PM To: SBE Subject: A Message to All Board Members *** NOTE: THIS E-MAIL WAS SENT FROM THE SBE CONTACT FORM WEB APPLICATION *** Title: Organization: Comments or Questions: Dear Board Members:
I have just reviewed the Appendices section of the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum currently open for Public Comment.
I would like to share the following with you as my Public Comment:
I feel that the entire direction of this curriculum is not to educate but to lead students to follow certain ideological leanings as advocates for identity politics. To my point, I would like to offer a quote from the Appendices: "One of the main focuses of ethnic studies is translating historical lessons and critical race theory into direct action for social justice."
I encourage the Board to rescind this curriculum and essentially rethink it as history education not political advocacy.
Very sincerely yours,
