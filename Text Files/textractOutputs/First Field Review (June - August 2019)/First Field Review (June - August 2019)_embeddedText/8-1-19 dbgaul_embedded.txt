One does not have to read (below) very far to see that your "ethics education" proposal is heading in the wrong direction. Your "teaching" that our country's formation and founding encourages everyone to believe they are a "victim" and that capitalism is at its core. Expect 'resistance' from reasonable and rational people concerned about their children and grand kids until you change your strategy from convincing folks WHAT to think rather than HOW to think.
-----------------------------------Guiding Principles and Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching:
Given the range and complexity of the field, it is important to identify the key values and principles of Ethnic Studies as a means to offer guidance for the development of Ethnic Studies courses, teaching, and learning. The foundational values of Ethnic Studies are housed in the conceptual model of the "double helix" which interweaves holistic humanization and critical consciousness. Humanization includes the values of love, respect, hope, and solidarity are based on celebration of community cultural wealth. The values rooted in humanization and critical consciousness shapes the following guiding principles for Ethnic Studies teaching and learning. These are the guiding values and principles each Ethnic Studies lesson should include. Ethnic Studies courses, teaching, and learning will cultivate empathy, community actualization, cultural perpetuity, self-worth, self-determination, and the holistic well-being of all participants, especially Native People/s and people of color; celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of color by providing a space to share their stories of struggle and resistance, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth; center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial, and marginalized knowledge; critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society; challenge imperialist/colonial hegemonic beliefs and practices on the ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized levels; connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels to ensure a truer democracy; and conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for post-imperial life that promotes collective narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radical healing.
