thank you for reviewing and not going forward with the curriculum as is. the very obvious attempt to institutionalize anti semitism needs to be stopped asap. unfortunately anti semitism is well and alive and anti zionistm is a branch of this poisonous tree. it has no place in our schools. thank you peace and love, rachel wahba
