From: Tony Quinteros Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New ethic studies curriculum
Concerned citizen: I'm concerned with the new ethic studies curriculum having a bias bent towards being Anti-Semitic and Anti-Israel in its teaching. I find the curriculum in this area falls under the guise of a false cause fallacy concerning the conflict in the middle east. I believe chapter 4 glossary #30-40 goes way beyond education into the area of indoctrination of the next generation. I was told today is the last day to express concerns, so as a private citizen I wanted to let you know that I'm both very saddened and deeply concerned.
Respectfully Tony Quinteros
