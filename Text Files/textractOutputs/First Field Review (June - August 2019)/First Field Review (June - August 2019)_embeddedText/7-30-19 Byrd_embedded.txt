Please see "California Wants to Teach Your Kids That Capitalism Is Racist" article in the 7/29/19 Wall Street Journal. The curriculum as described sounds very emotional (and single-sided) as opposed to rational and critical. The goal appears to be to feed the kids a formed opinion. That isn't teaching. Also, asking people to submit comments in Word is onerous and backwards. I don't have Word because there are free versions and Word is expensive. You should have requested responses in pdf format.
