From: nancy kronick Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 1:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California New High School Curriculum Antisemitic and AntiIsrael
Why is 25% of the Model Curriculum Advisory Committee that is tasked with developing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum made up of academics who have publicly aired their anti-Israel views and bias?
Jews are deeply troubled by the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), for its "omission of information about American Jews and anti-Semitism, its use of classic anti-Semitic stereotypes, and its blatant anti-Israel bias.
Who is going to have the courage to stand up to this type of hate?
