From: Robert Roth Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comment on the draft curriculum
I have been a teacher in SFUSD for the past 30 years. I applaud the writers of the draft curriculum for highlighting issues facing Arab Americans and for attempting to deepen understanding of the struggle in Palestine. These issues are woefully underrepresented in California textbooks and in the state's standards over the years. The inclusion of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is also a step forward, acknowledging a major international social movement of our time, and giving students the tools to broaden their understanding of this movement as one example of grassroots activists pushing for social change. I would hope that these sections are not removed in any revision of this curriculum. I would add, as a Jewish teacher, that I am offended by the constant refrain that criticism of Israel = anti-Semitism. It does not.
Sincerely,
Robert Roth Mission High School San Francisco, CA
