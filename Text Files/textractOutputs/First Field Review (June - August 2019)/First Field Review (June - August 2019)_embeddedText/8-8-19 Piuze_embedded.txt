I am submitting this input in response to your call for public comment regarding this draft.
I am deeply concerned that the model curriculum does not include the serious issue of anti-semitism. The curriculum may even promote anti-semitism by its inclusion of teaching on the anti-Israel BDS movement without presenting any alternative perspective on the Israel- Palestinian situation.
While children will benefit from education that helps them embrace diversity and reject racism, a curriculum that is one-sided will not accomplish this goal.
I urge you to add lessons about ant-semitism, identifying it as a form of racism. These lessons should include accounts of the Holocaust , with stories of American Jews who fled the Holocaust and discrimination in the former USSR and currently in countries in the middle east. It should also include a broader understanding of the 1948 War that presents both Palestinian and Israeli perspectives.
Thank you for your consideration,
