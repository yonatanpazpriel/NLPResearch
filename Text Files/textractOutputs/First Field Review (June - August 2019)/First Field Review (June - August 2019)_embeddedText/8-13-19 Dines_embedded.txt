From: Elaine Dines Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:53 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Elaine Dines Subject: anti-semitism in new curriculum
To Whom It May Concern,
The proposed new high school curriculum for ethnic studies is highly inconsiderate of the prejudice that Jewish Americans and world-wide Jews have suffered for centuries and are still suffering today with a renewed vengeance in Europe and in the United States. Indeed, the incidences of physical acts against Jews including assaults of school and college-aged students, as well as the murders of Jews recently, have increased markedly in the U.S. This is the result of a festering anti-semitism that is the job of our schools to help quell, not foster--as elements of this new curriculum do.
Have you considered what you may be provoking? Do the people making these critical decisions not appreciate the evils of our own modern history?
Please eliminate anything from the curriculum program that fosters hatred. Indeed, please teach the German Holocaust. Surely it isn't too difficult to make it to 1945 in the general history curriculum-- students need to be informed so that history is not damned to repeat itself. This is America, for G-d sake. Have you considered who it is that most of the world's white Supremacist Neo-Nazis are after today?
Sincerely, Elaine Dines Marks San Francisco
