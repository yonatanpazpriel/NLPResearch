Hello, I immigrated to this country 43 years ago from former Soviet Union where antisemitism was very prominent. Its very painful to see the spike of antisemitism in my new country!! It is against the basic principals of United States itself!! Where are we going??!!! Still hopeful that these changes will not happen, Tamara
