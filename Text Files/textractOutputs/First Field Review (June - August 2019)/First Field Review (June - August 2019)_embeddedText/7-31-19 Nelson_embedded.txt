If you want an exercise in making white or upper middle class students and teachers feel even more guilty about their perceived privilege, turn classroom authority over to children, and transform schools into breeding ground for social activism instead of learning the fundamentals and exploring career or college options, I guess this curriculum has a purpose. This is been a roll of colleges for as long as I can remember and now the state wants to take it down to the high school (or lower) level? You may have noticed that college enrollment is dropping, and I believe a large part of it is that there is very little actual learning going on, and social activism has taken over. And it is not making society better, it is simply widening the divide between "tribes." As a parent who's child just finished their public K-12 education and as a taxpayer, it seems you could achieve some of your goals by integrating A more dynamic approach into existing history, social science, and language arts course offerings. Not rewriting or erasing history so as not to offend, but teaching it as it happened and encouraging intelligent, civil discourse and debate in a structured manner. Thanks for reading.
