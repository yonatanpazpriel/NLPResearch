Unfortunately I cannot give my support for this ethnic studies curriculum. As an educator I wholeheartedly support ethnic studies, and educating our students and youth on multiculturalism, acceptance, solidarity, and awareness of ethnic history, including harm done to various groups.
However, your proposed curriculum has concerning content and absence of support for Jewish heritage and Israel. Therefore I cannot support it as is.
With respect, Terri Zurnamer
