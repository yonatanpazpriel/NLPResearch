From: tomsanchez56 Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 9:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerned American patriot
To whom it may concern,
As a US citizen, father, and grandfather I am deeply concerned about the new ethic studies that teach Anti-Semitic/Anti-Israel curriculum that is concerning the middle east. I would really wish you would evaluate and reconsider teaching this curriculum to our youth.
Respectfully, Thomas A. Sanchez
