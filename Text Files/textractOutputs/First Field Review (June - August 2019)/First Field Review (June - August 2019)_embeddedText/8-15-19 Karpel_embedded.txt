While I'm relieved that the State Board of Education has expressed reservations about the proposed curriculum for Ethnic Studies, it is extremely disturbing to realize that those involved with the process associated with developing this curriculum were comfortable with the ideas presented and brought it to the public in its current form.
The fact of this draft being made public reveals a tremendous amount of anti-Semitism in the current public education system in California. It also reveals not only the acceptance of, but the desire to promote a racist propaganda campaign on the youth in our state by those who have been entrusted with teaching them. These threats to the safety of our children need to be addressed as much as this curriculum needs to be thoroughly reviewed and probably completely rewritten.

This proposed curriculum is an attempt to take a political perspective and make it the orthodoxy of the educational establishment in California, so it can be used to indoctrinate children. This proposed curriculum is teaching a theory/ propaganda which divides the population into two groups: one good and one bad; one the oppressed and one the oppressor. The oppressor is systematically and consistently referred to as white, the oppressed are other groups. The worldview this curriculum offers, is superficial and dishonest in its omission of history in the US and other countries as well as in its omission of norms in countries outside of the United States from which many immigrants have come.

Look at the Chapter 2, Sample Course Materials. This chapter has 66 references to variants of the word "oppress". Variants of the word "oppress" appear 12 times in the Glossary which is indicative of how this propaganda is advocating the primacy of its paradigm of oppressor/ oppressed. Sadly, discrimination is something found throughout human history, it is not limited to the experience of people of color in the United States, to immigrants in the United States, or just to the United States. In the United States waves of white immigrants such as the Irish, Italians, Polish experienced discrimination. Today, discrimination continues around the world. The application of this definition in the proposed course materials ignores the discrimination exercised in countries outside of the US, including those where people of color are majorities. Where is the mention of systematic religious discrimination against Christians in the Middle East which has been described as approaching genocide in the Middle East: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/02/persecutiondriving-christians-out-of-middle-east-report Where is the mention of the history and effects of the caste system in India with a similar discussion of "systematic" impact on populations?

Rather than promoting the "loving" approach described in Chapter 1, page 1 line 22 of "Further, it is the xdisciplinary, loving, and critical praxis of holistic humanity � as educational and racial justice." this proposed curriculum doesn't highlight the opportunities that exist for all Americans, but is divisive and provides the justification for hating and maligning of innocent people, including those who are stereotyped as oppressors in the curriculum.

Glossary Page 14 Social justice- "The equitable distribution of resources (rights, money, food, housing, education, etc.) to every individual regardless of ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, or nationality."

This definition negates the efforts of individual work and effort.

Questions that need to be addressed /answered if such a definition is put forth: Who decides what the "equitable distribution of resources... to every individual..." will be? Who decided how that equitable distribution will be made? Who gave those who would make these decisions the authority to make them? This definition avoids the words "redistribution of wealth", "taking away what you have worked for" etc. But that's really what it says. Don't those who make those decisions become "oppressors" of those from whom they would take things away? What right have people to take away someone else's private property in the name of this amorphous definition of "social justice"?
This facile definition of "social justice" would undermine the Bill of Rights and the Constitution by opening the door to seizing/ taking away the assets of American citizens. This is not what should be taught in public schools in the United States. Public education should not be propaganda.
The devil is in the details and this is a nice sounding statement without an explanation of how it would be achieved. Dr. Thomas Sewell has some comments worth considering: "I have never understood why it is "greed" to want to keep the money you've earned, but not greed to want to take somebody else's money." "Much of the social history of the Western world, over the past three decades has been a history of replacing what worked with what sounded good." "One of the consequences of such notions as "entitlements" is that people who have contributed nothing to society feel

that society owes them something, apparently just for being nice enough to grace us with their presence."
The Bill of Rights states in Amendment IV: "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
The United States Constitution states: in "Article [V] (Amendment 5 - Rights of Persons) No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.
in "Article XIV (Amendment 14 - Rights Guaranteed: Privileges and Immunities of Citizenship, Due Process, and Equal Protection) 1: All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

Sample course studies This draft curriculum appears to claim authority to provide one-sided criticism of just about any aspect of society. Again, it seems more of a propaganda manual with talking points than an academic perspective. Look at pages 102 and 103 of the Sample Curriculums at the discussion of food and nutrition. Where is the scientific discussion, competing views regarding food supply, nutrition, etc.
Line starting with 2273 "Global food activist Vandana Shiva critiques the singleminded corporate worldview that favors the eradication of biodiversity and modification of all nature into plantations for profit."
Line starting with 2284 "Real food has, for many of us and in many ways, become unrecognizable as such. Most Americans do not eat a plant-based diet with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Instead, North Americans consume a lot of sugary, fried, or fake foods like sodas, energy drinks, chips and other bagged snacks, candy bars, and cookies which contain considerable amounts of high fructose corn syrup, sugar and artificial sweeteners, corn and soybean oils, and sodium. The average American eats 156 pounds (seventy-one kg) of added sugar every year. Not only are Americans eating these foods, they are eating more of them: per person we're now eating 750 more calories per day than we consumed thirty years ago. There are multiple factors that influence the dismal eating habits of many Americans. These include lack of access to healthy, fresh foods, which is a particular problem in working-class communities of color; easy access to fast food and junk food; advertising campaigns for sodas, fast food, and junk food that target youth; and agricultural subsidies that make processed and fake foods cheap and accessible."
