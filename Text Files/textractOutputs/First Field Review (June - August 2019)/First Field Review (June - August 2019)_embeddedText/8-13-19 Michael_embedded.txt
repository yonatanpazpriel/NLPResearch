An Armenian-American component must be included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to highlight the contributions of the large population of ArmenianAmericans in California. An aspect of the Armenian-American experience is the focus of my children's book, Under the Light of the Moon, which has been adopted by various California public school districts in order to teach this important history. Including examples of both "mirrors and windows" in our model curriculum is imperative so that Armenian-American students can make connections to their identities as well as feel validated and so that students of non-Armenian descent can also make connections between the similarities of Armenian-Americans and their own ethnicities. Furthermore, Armenian-American's have contributed so much to our society throughout several waves of immigration whether it is through agriculture in the Central Valley, politics (former CA governor George Deukmejian), the arts (published author William Saroyan), science (Raymond Damadian, inventor of the MRI) and many more. Lastly, the ANCA-WR Education Committee is committed to drafting a sample Armenian-American model that would meet these very important needs.
