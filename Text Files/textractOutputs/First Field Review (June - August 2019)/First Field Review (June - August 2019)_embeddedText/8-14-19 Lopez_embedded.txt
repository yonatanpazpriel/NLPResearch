Jorge Lopez, Ethnic Studies teacher at Roosevelt High School

I have been teaching for 17 years, many of the those years ethnic studies courses. Currently, for the last 5 years we have led a program at our school where our 9th grade students take a two semester course of ethnic studies. The model lessons generate are excellent, high quality, and can assure that will be incredibly engaging with high school youth. Many of the lessons provided are very similar to the lessons that we deliver. We include many of the same themes, vocab, skills, and lesson structure. The course at our school is very popular with our students and respected by our educator community. Parents give praise to see their children very engaged and interested in what they are learning in ethnic studies. The model curriculum is incredibly powerful, rigorous, and refreshing to see that it has remained grounded in a critical theories and pedagogies. Thank you for your amazing work! I love this!
