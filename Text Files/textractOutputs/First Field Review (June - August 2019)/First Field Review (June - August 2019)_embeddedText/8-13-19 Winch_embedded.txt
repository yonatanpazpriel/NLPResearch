From: Jennifer Winch Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent Subject: Please Include Anti-Semitism in the ESMC Model Curriculum before approving it
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I live in California and care a lot about educating our youth about diversity and inclusion of all types. I am writing to comment on the proposed ESMC proposed curriculum and I oppose it as written today because it fails to discuss anti-semitism, which has a long and ugly history both in this country and the world. The proposed curriculum as written reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism. As it stands today I believe this curriculum would institutionalize the teaching of anti-semitic stereotypes in our public schools, and it is not right to do this.
I am urging you to make major revisions or complete a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others who are also calling for this change. It needs to include Anti-Semitism and discuss the long timehsitorical persecution of Jews, which continues today.
I have Jewish friends and in the climate of hate in this country, anti-semitism remains near the top of the list for hate crimes, Surely you have noticed that synagogues as well as mosques and other places of worship are being attacked. There is no place in education to perpetuate anti-semitic tropes that will be teaching the next generation to wrongly hate Jews (and Israel). This is not inclusive and is not right.
Please do not approve this curriculum as it stands. I want you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Jennifer Winch Berkeley, CA
