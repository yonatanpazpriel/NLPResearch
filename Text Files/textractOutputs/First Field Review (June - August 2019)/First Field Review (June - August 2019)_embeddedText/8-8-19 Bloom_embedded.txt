Page 2, Teachers, please highlight BDS and Direct Action for Palestine, without your own position.
 Page 234, Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.
Page 237, Use unclear language that implies " Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country. Page 242, Frame the Palestinian narrative of 1948 War as fact, with no alternate perspectives. Page 264 - 269, Teachers should use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. It's crucial that the State of California add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. With the Country being so divided, it is important we emphasize the value of inclusion. BDS promotes hatred and division.

The introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to...enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society.

I am respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum.
