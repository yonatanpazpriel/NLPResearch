In general, I applaud this effort to teach ethnic studies in California public schools. This is an important topic for me. I was born in Montevideo, Uruguay, and immigrated to the United States (specifically Los Angeles, CA) in 1981, when I was 4 years old. We grew up working class and through hard work and perseverance, my parents were able to provide me and my siblings with a rich education. I have done all of my schooling in California, except for 4 years of medical school in Pittsburgh, PA. I returned to do a Family & Community Medicine residency at UCSF-San Francisco General Hospital specifically to work with underserved populations, especially Spanish-speaking monolingual patients whom I can help through my native Spanish language skills and cultural sensitivity. Currently, I work in the Salud en Espanol clinic at Kaiser Permanente, Oakland, CA, where I also serve as Physician Co-Lead of the Equity, Inclusion & Diversity Committee that represents one of the largest and most diverse patient service areas in all of California Kaiser Permanente � the East Bay (Oakland, Richmond, Alameda and Pinole). Needless to say, the topics that you propose are near and dear to my heart, and can be very important and enriching for our California students. I am concerned and deeply disappointed with the lack of attention to the plight of the Jewish people in the proposed curriculum, and to the anti-Israel rhetoric in various places. I am Jewish, and my grandparents escaped Nazi Germany and fled to any place where they could receive asylum -- Uruguay. Antisemitism is on the rise worldwide, and it is troubling to see waves of hatred towards Jews in which another future Holocaust would be imaginable were it not for the State of Israel. I have been a victim of hate speech and swastika tagging here in California! It's important to educate learners about these important topics in a fair manner to gain an understanding of this important culture and people. Some examples below. Discussion of the BDS movement without a balanced perspective that many of the Palestinian leaders hope for an eradication of the entire State of Israel. I understand that this is a very controversial topic, and I am not entirely opposed to mentioning the BDS movement, as long as there is an understanding of why Israel is important to Jews throughout the world, and why it feels

threatened (credibly) by its neighbors who many would like to see Israel decimated, including the terrorist organization Hamas. I'm concerned that there is no balance to the BDS movement and does not raise any critiques of this movement. On this page, it is a false equivalence to suggest that what is happening in the US-Mexico border is similar to that in IsraelPalestine. Biased perspective of the 1948 War, not a fair representation. Again, biased and alludes to the Palestinian perspective as positive and offers no criticism of Palestinian leadership and no positive perspective of Israel.
