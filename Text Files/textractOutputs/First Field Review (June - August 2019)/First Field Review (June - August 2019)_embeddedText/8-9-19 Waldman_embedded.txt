Hello,
It has been brought to my attention that a new proposal for Israeli studies is being promoted for California schools. I believe that this curriculum creates a bias and divide which will lead to further antisemitism and violence. Please consider the harsh effects that this curriculum will produce and instead promote education that allows for learning to work for peace for both sides.
Thank you.
