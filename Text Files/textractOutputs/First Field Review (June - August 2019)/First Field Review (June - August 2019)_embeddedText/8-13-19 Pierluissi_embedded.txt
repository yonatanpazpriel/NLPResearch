From: Talia Pierluissi Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on ethnic studies
To the Cal. Dept. of Education / Instructional Quality Commission and Those This May Concern: I am a San Francisco resident and parent of two former SFUSD students. I am disturbed by the numerous instances of anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli content and course material throughout the ESMC. I strongly encourage the Dept. of Education to seriously reconsider numerous aspects of the ESMC that are demeaning to Jewish Americans, particularly those who support the Jewish national homeland, the State of Israel. It's already challenging for young Jewish people who confront anti-Israel rhetoric regularly in the media. Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. Sincereley,
