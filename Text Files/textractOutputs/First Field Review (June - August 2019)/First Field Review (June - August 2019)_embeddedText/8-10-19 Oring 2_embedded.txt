The whole document seems bogged down with pedagogy that is a survey of from the prospective of grievances that will foment future protests. A better approach is incorporating the Teaching Tolerance lesson plans that encourage acceptance of all diverse groups (https://oneworldoneheartbeating.com/for_teachers/teaching-tolerance/). For example, some of the titles of the lesson plans from Teaching Tolerance really encourage participation and tolerance: "Claim It"--Differences & SimilaritesCreating a climate of inclusion; Understanding Stereotypes; or Getting out of the Box (define discrimination and prejudice to develop action plan to heal racism).

The 18 member committee is all from southern CA--no one from northern CA: no one from Sacramento, Chico, Redding, Yreka, Arcata, Susanville, or Alturas. This is an outrage.

There are some good parts; especially the use of talking circles. Why not use them in all units not just the unit on Native Americans?

There seems to be confusion between race and ethnicity: The traditional definition of race and ethnicity is related to biological and sociological factors respectively. Race refers to a person's physical characteristics, such as bone structure and skin, hair, or eye color. Ethnicity, however, refers to cultural factors, including nationality, regional culture, ancestry, and language.

Gender identity is not related to ethnicity. It belongs in biology with the study of genetic heredity and mutations that lead to differences. There is no discussion of America as a melting pot with lots of great contributions by many groups. Page 2, lines 50-51 "a space for all students to learn about and analyze their identities and hxrstories, feel proud of them and actualize their full humanity" If this is a goal, then start with what each ethnic group has contributed to our state, looking at their heroes first. General: Although the document says there should be community involvement, it is passed over quickly.

Page 4, line 110 .."students will select a Southern CA tribe to study..." Why limit to Southern CA tribes? We have a number of tribes in Northern CA. Page 5, lines 157-174 Muslims and Arabs. Why limit it to those? There are other groups in large numbers in some parts of the state, e.g. Sikhs, Hindus
Page 6, line 146: "use S.O.A.P.S analysis to dissect document" I could not find SOAPS defined. Is it Subjective, Objective, Analysis, Plan, as used in medicine? Pages 28-30 Privilege Walk serves no useful purpose. Gender harassment is not ethnicity.

Pages 49-50 lines 982 � 1006. Why not include inspirational African Americans such as Toni Morrison or Colson Whitehead? Page 95 line 2086: "Ethnic Studies Values & Principles Alignment 3,4,7." (Listed in Chapter 1); however, Chapter 1 does not articulate them by number. Page 96, lines 2099-2100. "Native American & Mexican diets......understand how these two food ways & cultures are connected" It only implies it in discussion of indigenous tribes of northern Mexico. However the foods listed (corn, beans, squash) as "The Three Sisters" are not part of northern CA tribes. Page 112, lines 2540-2546: excellent plan for debates so that each team argues one side one time and the other side in second debate. Pages 169-170 Bill Analysis Worksheet: Excellent!

Page 172, line3540: Students will develop speaking skills through a Socratic seminar discussion" No definition of Socratic Page 182, line 3775 "These two widows" ? information in lines 3768-3774 indicates that one is a widow and the other is a widower. Page 205 line 4253: "Emeryville Bay Street Mall" How is it pertinent to all the rural areas of CA? Pages 232-287 Arab American Studies Course Outline Fifty-five pages are devoted to grievances concerning Arab Americans, while zero pages are allotted for Jewish Americans. In 2018, the Jewish population of CA was 1,182,990 while the Arab American population was 324,609 I understand that these numbers are those individuals who identify as those groups. Why not start with a celebration of their contributions to the state?
