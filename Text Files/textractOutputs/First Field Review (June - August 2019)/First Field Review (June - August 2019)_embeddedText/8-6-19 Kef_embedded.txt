From: Kef Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 8:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from California curriculum
Dear School representatives, I am alarmed that anti-Israel biased curriculum is being introduced. 1. BDS promotes hate and not inclusion. 2. This "curriculum" will hurt my family and all our Jewish friends in the community. 3. The Glossary for the curriculum - states that BDS is a movement to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It offers no critical perspectives about the BDS campaign for hate with seeks to destroy the State of Israel. 4. Israel educates its people on tolerance and inclusion. This proposed curriculum is one sided and a false narrative. No critical talking points. (p. 234) 5. Israel-Palestine- is not an Arab country. Unclear language. (p. 237). 6. Frame the 1948 war from the Palestinian prospective as fact. No alternative perspectives to facts (p.242). 7. Poetry critical of Israel and supporting Palestinians ( p. 256, 264-269).
8. The Introduction- there is no lesson about the Jewish community. With antisemitism on the rise and ignorance about the Jewish people - this curriculum will only add to more racism and antisemitism towards Jews.
As a doctor in this community, with children in public high school - I am deeply shocked and disturbed. Please modify this hateful and inaccurate curriculum. Dr. Benderly.
