From: Lauren Ficks Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 10:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: STOP NEW Ethnic studies curriculum
Please stand back and review curriculum carefully. A discussion of ethnic studies is of course important, but the OVERT oMISSION of the word /concept/ reality of ANTISEMITISM From even the glossary of terms makes it very clear that this is a completely biased, pro-Palestinian and left-wing curriculum outline. It is factually inaccurate and merely continues the non-factually based ideas of the BDS movement. PLEASE use your common sense. I am sure those in charge know exactly the antiSemitic end of this curriculum. Sincerely, Lauren G. Ficks,, MD
