From: Sylvia Alderman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:21 PM To: Tony Thurmond; Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am extremely concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a Middle School librarian, now retired, I tried to ensure that the materials I made available to my students were evenly balanced and allowed them to evaluate and draw reasoned conclusions about difficult subjects. It appears that the proposed curriculum would not meet those criteria on the issues of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, BDS, Anti-Semitism in the United States among others.
I request that you make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Sylvia Alderman
