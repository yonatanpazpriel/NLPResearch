From: Mark Goldberg Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California's Ethnic Curriculum
Dear Sir/Ma'am,
It's been brought to my attention that some of the Ethnic Curriculum may be biased against Jews and Israel. Example, Page 1 omits a definition of antisemitism and page 2 includes a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions.) Page 242 uses poliitically biased language referring to the founding of Israel. (lines 5157-61) and pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
Jewish Culture and the Jewish people have brought many great additions to American life, in addition to their contributions to the entertainment industry right here in California. The state of Israel was founded with purchased land by desperate Jews after the Holocaust, and they have been under constant attack by their neighbors since then.
I am ALL FOR ethnic studies and believe in a fair and balanced curriculum.
Sincerely, Mark Lee Goldberg
