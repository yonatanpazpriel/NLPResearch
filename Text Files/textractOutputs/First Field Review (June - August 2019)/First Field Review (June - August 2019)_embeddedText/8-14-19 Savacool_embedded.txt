Dear SBE and CDE, What a completely biased committee you have here. Shame on you, SBE and CDE for crafting this vitriol to be spoon-fed to our public school children. An ethnic studies course requirement for graduation? I hope AB 331 never sees the light of day. Most public school children are not even at grade level standards in reading, writing, and math. Why not focus on that, rather than creating social justice warriors that believe their identity is defined by their skin color or nationality? Why not bring people together? I am absolutely outraged. Signed, A parent of two public school students who have different beliefs than you! Amy Savacool San Diego, CA
