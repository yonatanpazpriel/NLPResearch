California Department of education
The proposed curriculum, intended to be used in all California public high schools, is blatantly anti-Semitic and antiIsrael, 83 organizations demand that, before even fixing the curriculum, the California Department of Education establish safeguards that prevent any and all future attempts to use educational curricula to indoctrinate students with a biased, inaccurate and hateful agenda. The 83 civil rights, human rights, religious and education organizations are deeply troubled by the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)," wrote the groups in the letter organized by AMCHA Initiative, for its "omission of information about American Jews and anti-Semitism, its use of classic antiSemitic stereotypes, and its blatant anti-Israel bias." The groups go further, however, and point out that the proposed curriculum "highlight[s] a much deeper and more grave problem ï¿½ the fact that an educational curriculum can be hijacked by those pushing a political and hateful agenda." It is outrageous that an effort to teach students about marginalized communities is being used to promote a campaign of hate against Israel."
