To whom it may concern,
We cannot emphasize more the absolute dishonesty and politically infused biases inherent in this curriculums quest to infuse our school children with an unbalanced anti capitalistic view point under the guise of ethnic studies.
Vilifying certain founding fathers of our country while lionizing avowed terrorists who fit the now whitewashed views of these individuals.
Next you'll lionize the SLA, Black Panthers, The Weathermen or ANTIFA as patriots and conveniently excuse these organizations violence and bloodshed of the mostly innocent.
California school curriculums on social and historical events should be unbiassed, balanced and in general apolitical. Equal in differing positions to encourage healthy discussions with an emphasis on non-violence, rather than lauding those in the past who perpetrated violent behavior.
I know I am one voice who you will most likely ignore. But, as one who grew up during the Vietnam war and the Ohio State debacle, I say unto those who push this agenda, be careful what you wish for. As this world is filled with the unintended consequences of the so called righteous vocal single issue (minded) few.
Respectfully
