I think this whole idea is bad. I don't want this kind of stuff taught in public schools. Leave it to the parents to educate their children on race relations and other cultural issues. I believe that the children's parents and peers are better suited to address these issues at home and in their communities. I can't imagine a white middle-aged woman preaching to Latino and Back kids about racism in America and how bad capitalism is, is going to be very effective. It might come off as disingenuous and make parents upset. What if the culture doesn't support those beliefs? What about very conservative Muslim communities where men dominate the culture at home? I think there will be a lot of push back from those kinds of communities. Again, I think this should be left to the parents and peers of the children to make those kinds of socio-cultural education decisions and then teach them about their cultural heritage at home or at community events. Public schools are not the place for this.
