I am opposed to this proposed curriculum. I object to any attempt to train our next generations in victimhood and how to generate civil protest. I also object to making it mandatory for high school graduation. We live in the greatest country on the planet. Why else would so many people be risking everything to enter it? Capitalism is the cause of our country's success and prosperity. It is not a means of enslaving the masses. To fill our children's developing minds with this poison is just wrong. Keep our schools out of politics and focus your efforts on improving the education of our young. Teach them to read. Teach them to add and subtract. Teach them open mindedness and respectful tolerance for other points of view. Teach them to respect their neighbors, their community and their country. Maybe after our schools have achieved rankings that put California back into the success category, instead of the failure category we've been mired in for so long, maybe then the schools can consider adding onto the curriculum. But first, let's take care of the basics! Teach them to love the country they are so fortunate to be a part of. Don't teach them reasons why they should hate it.
I pray that the State Senate (unlike the Assembly) can see the damage this type of instruction will do to our next generations, and when the vote is taken, refuses to make this "Ethnic Studies" course mandatory. That way, each school district can make its own decision on whether or not to include it...and then answer to the parents for their decision.
