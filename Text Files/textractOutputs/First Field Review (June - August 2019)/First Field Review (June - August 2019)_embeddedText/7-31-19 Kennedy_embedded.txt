Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Lines 42-45 refer to a debt owed partially from "enforced sociopolitical, cultural-historical, economic, and moral constraints via the education system." How would the Ethnic Studies curriculum not enforce such constraints via the education system? The curriculum suggests capitalism as a "form of power and oppression at the intersections of our society" (lines 307308) yet makes no effort to list socialism as a similar form of power and oppression, despite socialism leading to far more governmental power and potential oppression than capitalism; this would be an enforced sociopolitical constraint in its promotion of certain sociopolitical systems and denigration of others. The curriculum promises to "center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial, and marginalized knowledge" (lines 304-305); this would be an enforced cultural-historical constraint in its implication that certain groups and backgrounds deserve to be valued more highly. The curriculum wants to ensure "teachers are able to provide a space for multiple perspectives and narratives to be included in units and lessons simultaneously" (lines 202-204), yet would such a curriculum welcome a perspective or narrative promoting imperialism or opposed to any social change? If these perspectives are not welcomed equally as perspectives promoted by the curriculum, this presents an enforced moral constraint.
