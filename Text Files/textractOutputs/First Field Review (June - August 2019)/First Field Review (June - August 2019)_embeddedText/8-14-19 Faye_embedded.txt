From: Caronan, Faye Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,
I am an alumni of the California K-12 public school system (Rowland Unified School District) and received a Ph.D. In Ethnic Studies from UCSD. I am currently an Ethnic Studies Professor at a public university that serves a very diverse student population. Ethnic Studies courses improve student outcomes for underserved, marginalized communities. Introducing Ethnic Studies in public K-12 schools would go a long way in addressing educational inequities.
For over 50 years, communities of color have struggled to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. Students and faculty have advocated for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a legitimate academic discipline through sit-ins, rallies and strikes. Research shows when Ethnic Studies is taught, it results in narrowing and closing of the opportunity gap for students from underserved communities. We urge you not to give in to right-wing racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, anti-progressivism, and anti-intellectualism that does not respect the languages, histories and cultural backgrounds of students of color. Students should be given the opportunity to study about their ancestral roots to better understand the present, and be able to imagine a brighter, more just and equitable future for California, the US, and the world.
Sincerely,
Faye C. Caronan, Ph.D.
