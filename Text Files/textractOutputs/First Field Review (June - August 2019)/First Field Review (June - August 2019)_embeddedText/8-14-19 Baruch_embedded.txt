To Whom It May Concern:
It is disturbing to think that without your intervention, a curriculum that places Jews in a very negative light will be taught as part of an effort to help students understand minorities. I ask you to examine this matter closely and ask yourselves what students will learn from the ESMC. Teaching students to hate one minority is not going to help our effort to stamp out bigotry.
Thank you.
