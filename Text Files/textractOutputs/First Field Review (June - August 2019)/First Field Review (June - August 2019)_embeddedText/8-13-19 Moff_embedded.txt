Chapter 2, Pages 234: The course "Arab American Studies" includes a topic "Comparative Border Studies: Mexico and Palestine" that promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Chapter 2, Pages 234-235: The course "Arab American Studies" proposes to cover "Significant Figures" that include figures such as Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar who are among the most polarizing and anti-Israel figures in U.S. public life. Further, there are no Arab Americans listed who are from the American Muslim Reform movement, which is a socially progressive movement of Arab Americans that promotes a more peaceful and tolerant Arab American identity, one that seeks to collaborate with Jewish Americans and does not demonize or delegitimize Jews or the State of Israel. Chapter 2, Page 242: Use and definition of "Nakba" frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspective. Page 2, Lines 30-40. The definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel describes it as a "soclal movement". The definition then parrots BDS talking points such as describing Palestinians as "living under apartheid conditions." BDS is actually a political ideology whose goal is eliminating the State of Israel. The glossary offers no critical perspectives about BDS, which falsely characterizes Israel as a criminal state and delegitimizes the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination. Permitting students to study BDS as a "social movement" with these talking points will be divisive and will undermine peaceful discussion about the Palestinian-Israel conflict.

Page 10, Lines 239-240: The Glossary contains the definition of the term "Islamophobia" as "hatred, discrimination, fear, and prejudice against Muslims and the overall religion of Islam," but the Glossary does not contain a definition of "antisemitism." Antisemitism is the #1 incident of religious-based hate crime in the United States. The omission of the term "antisemitism" from the Glossary is itself antisemitic because the omission bespeaks the authors' failure to consider Jews as a minority ethnicity that is also the frequent target of bigotry, hatred and violence. At a minimum, the Glossary should define antisemitism just like Islamophobia: ""hatred, discrimination, fear and prejudice against Jews and the Jewish religion"
