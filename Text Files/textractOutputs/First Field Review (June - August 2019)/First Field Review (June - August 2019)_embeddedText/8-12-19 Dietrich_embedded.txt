To whom it may concern,
As a parent of a student in the California public school system, I am shocked and appalled at the blatant radical activism proposed in this curriculum. The fact we even have to consider this disaster of a curriculum is ridiculous. According to what I read, none of this is based on facts and it appears geared towards radicalization of our children.
I strongly urge you to trash this proposed curriculum for the sake of the children and their future. Please bring back some common sense and integrity to our broken education system.
Thank you for your time and consideration,
A concerned parent
