Dear sir or madam,
As a California voter and attorney who frequently cheers on the progressive policies and laws being championed by the California legislature, I am truly disheartened to have to write this message condemning the proposed ESMC legislation. I am stunned that California -- a state that holds itself out as valuing and protecting the rights and identities of all cultures and backgrounds -- would consider such a blatantly anti-semitic program.
While I laud the general goals of this program, the substance of the curriculum is extremely troubling, given its failure to educate students on (or even recognize the existence of) antisemitism. The ESMC effectively erases the Jewish experience at a time that white nationalism and anti-semitism are indisputably on the rise (see: Tree of Life synagogue, Poway, Charlottesville). How can this omission possibly be justified in the context of a course that is aimed to educate students on the experiences of a multitude of backgrounds and cultures??? The curriculum's one-sided view of the BDS movement is equally troubling -- again, for a program that is designed to encourage students to think critically about varying viewpoints, the ESMC is deafeningly silent when it comes to legitimate positions opposing the purpose and efficacy of BDS.
If the California legislature's goal is truly to educate the state's students and open their minds to the experiences and histories of all people, it would be not only an injustice but an absolute failure to pass the ESMC as currently contemplated.
Respectfully, Shani Smith Fisher Los Angeles, CA
