General

Rochelle Gause, California I appreciate the goals listed on page 233 and the inclusion of a diverse

Parent

history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia

and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized

students. With the rampant Islamophobia in our country it is such an

important time to share the history and cultural of Arab Americans.

Glossary and Rochelle Gause, California I was happy to see reference to the BDS movement in the glossary and in a

Parent

sample lesson plan. U.S. history has many examples of the power of

boycott and divestment to achieve social justice throughout history from the

Montgomery bus boycott to the Farmworker grape boycott. I fear pro-Israel

groups will pressure you into removing reference to this important justice

movement with false claims of anti-semitism and that breaks my heart.

Please stand strong! Here is a link to more information on this silencing

effort nationally: https://palestinelegal.org/redefinition-efforts Thanks for all

you do for the education of our children!
