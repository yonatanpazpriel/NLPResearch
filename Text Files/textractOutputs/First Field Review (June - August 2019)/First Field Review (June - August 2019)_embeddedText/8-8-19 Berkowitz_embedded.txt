From: Martin Berkowitz Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 12:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comments on the ESMC
The authors of the ethnic studies section of AB 331 were so heavily staffed by virulent anti-Semitic and anti Israel personnel as to make the section on Jewish historical participation in California totally distorted and vile! If this curriculum section is not drastically revised to reflect truthful historical data California will willfully be participating in a anti-Semitic school curriculum to it's everlasting degradation in opposition to the very goal the curriculum was meant to achieve
