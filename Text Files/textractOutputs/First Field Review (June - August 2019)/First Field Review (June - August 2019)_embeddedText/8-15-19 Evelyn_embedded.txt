I oppose this course. It is not a healthy course for America's students educational structure.
It is indoctrination into violence and we do not need that. It is antiSemitic. It encourages them to grow up into a leftist movement. It is too extreme.
Schools need to focus on education. California schools need to teach kids to support capitalism upon which our nation is built. Our students minds must be free of radicals.
