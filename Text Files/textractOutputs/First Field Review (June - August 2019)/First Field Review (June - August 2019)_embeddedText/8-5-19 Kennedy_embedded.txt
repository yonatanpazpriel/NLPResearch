From: Patrick Kennedy Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 5:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments for new studies curriculum
Hello, I want to view the course outline and content for the new ethnic studies program. I have not heard good things about it and want to take a look at it myself so I can make a well informed comment. I need Microsoft Office to open it? Are you kidding? How many average people have Microsoft Office? To me this seems to be a way of limiting viewing to the general public and seems like a very sneaky move by the Dept of Education.
Sincerely, Patrick Kennedy
