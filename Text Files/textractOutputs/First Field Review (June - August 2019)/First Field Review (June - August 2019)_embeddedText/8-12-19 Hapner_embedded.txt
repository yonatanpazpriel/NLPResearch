From: Ruth Ann Hapner Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 9:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: I am appalled to learn about your possible ethic studies curriculum.
This gives praise to the BDS movement which tries to isolate Israel from the world. It calls attention to a nonexistent apartheid society. This curriculum is completely one sided and contributes nothing positive to what is the reality of Israel. It encourages hatred without knowledge toward Israel. PLEASE, PLEASE, do not allow this curriculum to go forward. Ruth Ann Hapner.
