This is a general comment about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. Thank you! It's about time. I am pleased and relieved that CA is finally doing what is right for its increasingly diverse students and for tomorrow's voters. I have reviewed the documents that you provide, and although there is always room for improvement, I believe that this curriculum is an excellent start. I hope that all those involved in making sure that Governor Newsom signs continue to be engaged and encouraged.

One last thought: I don't see much representation of or inclusion of the diverse constituencies in the "Latinx" community. I encourage that the entire curriculum be revised so that it is clearly obvious that Latinos are very diverse and that the umbrella label "Latino/a/x" elides a host of other identities, histories, and intersections.

The same comment applies to "Asian" since that seems buried in the curriculum. The multiplicity of experiences and histories have to be revealed and acknowledge, even if only as a survey.
