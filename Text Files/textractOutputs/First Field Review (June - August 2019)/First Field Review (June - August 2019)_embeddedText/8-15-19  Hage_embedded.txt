As an Arab-American academic and organizer, I support the objectives listed for example on page 233 which outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as means by which to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination. Growing up in the stew of post-9/11 anti-Arab racism, I found that the greatest source of alienation, discrimination, and discomfort I experienced was in the school system. Racist tropes and narratives of violence, terrorism, and backwardness categorize the Arab subject's experience of itself, especially in our classrooms. Please do not allow Arab students, American born or immigrants, to continue to be victims of these false narratives; I believe the Arab-Studies curriculum drafted AS IS is an excellent first step in combatting the prevailing racial attitudes of the public at large with respect to Arabs as a cultural and political group.
