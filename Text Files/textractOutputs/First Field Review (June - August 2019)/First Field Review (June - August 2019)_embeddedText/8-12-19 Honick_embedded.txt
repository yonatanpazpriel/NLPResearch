From: Joe Honick Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:26 AM To: CFIRD Subject: ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
There seem to be many misunderstandings with respect to this program as it may affect the Jewish experience, history and other related studies. Can you provide me with factual data as to the handling of the Jewish ethnicity, history etc. It is my intention to address this subject urgently with appropriate legislative leaders at the state and federal levels.
Thank you. Joseph J. Honick, President GMA International Ltd
