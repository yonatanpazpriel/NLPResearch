Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
On behalf of the students, staff, and community of the Las Virgenes Unified School District, which serves the cities of Agoura Hills, Calabasas, Hidden Hills, Westlake Village, and unincorporated areas of northern Los Angeles County, I would like to share my very significant concerns regarding the draft of the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, (ESMC). It is my request that the ESMC only move forward with serious and substantive revisions. ESMC comes from Assembly Bill 2016, which was passed by the governor of California on September 13, 2016. In that Assembly Bill, the legislature had several findings and declarations which included, Section 1-A states that the State of California is committed to providing excellent educational opportunities to all of its pupils, which I could not agree with more. Section 1-F states that educational standards should be guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations.

My concerns with the draft curriculum, which are also shared by leaders of on our Board of Education, local city council members, and local state legislators Senator Henry Stern, Senator Ben Allen, Assemblymember Jessie Gabriel, and all members of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, are as follows:

a. The Commission's decision to exclude antisemitism and the Armenian genocide

from the draft curriculum marginalizes the American Jewish and American Armenian

experiences, amongst others.

b. The ESMC draft advances an extreme and politically motivated biased point of

view that delegitimizes the existence of the State of Israel while also delivering support

of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.

c. The ESMC draft provides an extreme, politically motivated definition of

"Capitalism" that aligns this foundational element of our economic system as being

comparable to the horrific ills of "racism" and "white supremacy".

d. The ESMC draft does not present a balanced perspective on the Israeli-

Palestinian conflict.

e. The ESMC draft does not provide substance to the very serious and growing

issue of anti-Semitism.

f.

The ESMC draft uses an anti-Semitic trope.

Certainly, the goal of an ethnic studies course would be to be inclusive and balanced, and this draft curriculum is not sufficiently so at this point. In conclusion, a course on Ethnic Studies has the potential to positively impact and enrich the educational experience and the engagement of students across California; therefore, it is essential to get this right and to be inclusive, sensitive, and supportive of all of our California residents and communities while encouraging and engaging in rigorous academic processes.
