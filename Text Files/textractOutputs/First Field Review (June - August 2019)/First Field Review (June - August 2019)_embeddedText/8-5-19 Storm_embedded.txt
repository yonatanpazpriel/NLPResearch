Just 100 days ago, a man entered a synagogue in California and shot worshippers because--and only because--they were Jewish. Yet this proposed standard includes nothing to education students about antisemitism. Sadly and ironically, the proposed content already includes matter that is in itself antisemitic inasmuch as the so-called "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions" movement is a crypto-antisemitic movement in the sheep's clothing of a social justice movement. My students deserve better. Pages include page numbers: 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269.
