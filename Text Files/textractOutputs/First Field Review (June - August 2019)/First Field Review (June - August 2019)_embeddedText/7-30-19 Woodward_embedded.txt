I object to including capitalism as part of the curriculum on racism/oppression. Even socialist programs in Sweden, Denmark, etc...are based on capitalism.
In addition, using "cis" is insulting. And what is "hxstory"? Please stop redefining/inventing language to push the trans agenda. Those women's/homosexual rights the curriculum supposedly supports are being eroded by transgender "rights".
Women have worked hard to have places of safety and a level sports field. These are being eroded by men. The curriculum screams patriarchy, yet women are currently being forced to accept men into their most vulnerable spaces. Women are being forced to compete against men.
In addition, research supports that children identifying as the opposite sex typically grow up to be homosexual. With the trans push, and the hormone intervention, those kids that would otherwise be gay, are sterilized. This is child abuse, pure and simple. Gay eugenics.
Our job is to educate, not indoctrinate. Our goal is to include, not erase.
Thanks for your consideration, Nicole Woodward A concerned parent
