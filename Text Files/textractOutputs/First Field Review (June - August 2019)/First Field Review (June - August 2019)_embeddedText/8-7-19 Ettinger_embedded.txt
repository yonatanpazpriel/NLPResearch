Line 30, page 2. Definition of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) needs correction to reflect that members of BDS mistakenly believe that Palestinians are living under apartheid conditions.

Maybe you should put apartheid in quotes.

Line 4957 page 234. Where in the curriculum does it explain the harm that BDS does to the Palestinian people? For example, SodaStream, and Israeli company, employed thousands of Palestinians, but because of BDS, they were forced to move away from the West Bank. The result was that hundreds of Palestinians lost their jobs. See the following articles with personal testimonials by Palestinians: https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Palestinian-employees-hurt-byBDS-speak-up-about-its-negative-effects-560511 https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/how-bds-hurts-palestinians-and-hinders-peace/ Thanks for including Asians. What about the Jewish Ethnic group?
