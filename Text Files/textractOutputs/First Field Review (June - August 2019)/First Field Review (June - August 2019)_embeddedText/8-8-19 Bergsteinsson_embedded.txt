I have read you model curriculum and I don't know whether to laugh or cry. This is so extreme that it isn't even trying to hide, it is full on leftist propaganda. So capitalism is listed right up there with racist and white supremacy? I'm sure you will ignore mine and others concerns as the initiative is so far off the mark that you obviously are completely on board, If this represents you view of a rational "education" program, the disservice you are doing to your citizens and our children is beyond comprehension. This needs to be completely scarped, it is beyond redemption.
