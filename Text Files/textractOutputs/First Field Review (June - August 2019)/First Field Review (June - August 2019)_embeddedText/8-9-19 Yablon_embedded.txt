Page 35, Line 685
One of the main purposes of an ethnic studies curriculum is to introduce students to various forms of "the Other" in our society, groups who the student may not be very familiar with.
The topics of Jews and Anti-Semitism is glaringly missing from this discussion. An item listed on line 685 mentions the BDS movement in Palestine, but this shows political bias in the curriculum.

Anti-Semitism is nothing new, but it is on the rise worldwide. The BDS movement is often associated with both anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism.

Although mention is made of anti-Arab treatment in American society, no mention is made of anti-Jewish treatment in American society. Of course, this is an entirely biased approach and should be corrected.

If the Department of Education is seriously attempting to give fair treatment to the various groups then it should really give fair treatment. Anti-Semitism is and has been a serious problem in American society. There have been violent actions taken against Jews just in the last year that have made the news.

Include as much attention to how Jews are viewed and treated in the United States as the amount of attention given to any other group or movement. That is only fair and ethical.

Do the right thing and abandon bias in the curriculum.

Thank you.
