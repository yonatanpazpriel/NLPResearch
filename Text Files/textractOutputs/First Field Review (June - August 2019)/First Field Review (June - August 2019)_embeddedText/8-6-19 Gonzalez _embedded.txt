First off I would like to say I'm a minority, so in way is this from a perspective of a White individual. If you go through with this nonsense about making our public schools mainly about races I will be removing all my children from school. It's disgusting what has mushrooms into complete racial curriculum. What happened to simply educating our children to be sound adults, not victims and young adults who will be inheriting racist tendencies towards other individuals and not focusing on real studies.
