It is wrong for an "ethnic studies" curriculum not to include Jews as an ethnic group that has a long history in California, including past and current antiSemitism. The only ethnic groups included in the curriculum are people of color. Students need to understand that ethnic groups come in all colors. Jews are white, AND an ethnic minority that has been persecuted and discriminated against. The message you send by not including Jews in the curriculum feeds into current anti-Semitic tropes. Page 234, lines 4956, 4957, 4958. These topic areas are politically biased, especially as they are labeled. In combination with the absence of any reference to Jews in the curriculum, the topics feel like they are clearly anti-Israel (which they are) and anti-Semitic as well. Why, when discussing Arab-Americans, is the sample topic focus on Palestine and its conflict with Israel only? What about Egyptians and their struggles against a repressive government? What about the issues Saudi women face and the struggle Arab women face for equal rights compared to Americans? By singling out only Palestinians in their struggle against Israel, the curriculum reveals its strong anti-Israel (and perhaps antiSemitic) bias.

p. 268-269. The Arabic verse rapped by Shadia Mansour. This rap promulgates the anti-Semitic canard that Jews nefariously control the media. This is a standard plank of anti-Semites globally, including white supremacists in the U.S. Surely there are other raps that can be used in lessons to high schoolers in California that don't promote and glorify anti-Semitism. Again, featuring this antiSemitic content, combined with not even considering Jews as an ethnic minority in the ethnic studies curriculum, shows strong anti-Semitic bias. It should be unacceptable to teach our young people that Jews are the enemy rather than another ethnic minority that has faced persecution in this country and state.
