A1The phrase American exceptionalism today is treated like a joke... An arrogant joke perpetrated by a very hard right wing that wants to be very protectionist and not deal with the rest of the world... Not exactly the case not exactly at all....
The settlement of the Western Hemisphere was many things certainly brutal of course but beyond that a very darwinian type of experiment with large groups of people that had high confidence levels and high tolerance for risk... They were taking a big risk in moving but they knew they could do it... An interesting experiment..... the courage of all these settlers is to be admired
They mostly, but certainly not exclusively , came from a Europe with a very entrenched Serf and feudal Lord system.... and the chances that the Serfs, through the generations, would ever change their lot in life was very,very, very low..... this new land offered an opportunity for something different... And again I have to stress it was a very interesting Darwin like selection of the people that came here for being able to tolerate high risk situation if there was a possibility of bettering their situation...... this is where this American exceptionalism comes from...... however you wish to describe it.... the many different peoples that came here all were selected through circumstances to be exceptional in this way that they were very willing to work hard for something better...... further, this selection also extends into today but not to the same degree.... a small example I use the refugee coming here from India or Haiti where they leave everything they had behind to come here.... that individual truly has this component in their DNA as well.
Pardon this less than scholarly treatment which I am giving to a very fast subject.
One of the things that is most key that goes into this inbred desire to succeed and thrive is the necessity for a "middle-class"... That is what all these peoples of whatever generation strive for ...that middle class...
Well capitalism does certainly not guarantee this.. it is one of the most robust ways for people's to attain it. Examples of this kind of ability to jump from one class to another are very great I won't bore you with any.
Of course I need to offer that capitalism can be a very mean Taskmaster... and basically in all instances it needs to be briddled back so it's potential does not squash people.... but the ability for individuals to be able to jump from one class to another cannot be denied.
Certainly regulations are in order but the best way to deal with the realities of capitalism is through education..
Now how does all this have anything to do with ethnic studies ?..... please take a moment and let me explain....it's worth it..... the most important thing I discussed here what is the very dynamic natural selection component which exists in that people who come here. By their nature have a high tolerance

for risk...ALL PEOPLES..... do not make the mistake of painting the picture of all the people here as being victims of something... they are not they are risk-takers..... and this is a great commonality which is shared by all who come here..... so by its nature is America different... Possibly even exceptional... It might be...... I think the most meaningful thing here is the capacity for people or peoples.... to jump from one class to another... Relatively quickly.... this is not possible other places
