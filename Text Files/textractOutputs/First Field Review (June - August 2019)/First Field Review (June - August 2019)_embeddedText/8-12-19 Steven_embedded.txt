DePaul University College a. In or around November 2018, the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported

of Law and Director of its that in 2017 (the most recent year in which data has been collected), 60% of

Center for Jewish Law &

religious hate crimes in the United States was anti-Jewish. That means that

there were substantially more anti-Jewish hate crimes than all other types of

However, I write in my

religious hate crimes. Only 17% of religious hate crimes were anti-Islamic and

individual capacity and not 5% was anti-Catholic.

on behalf of DePaul

University.

In 2016, anti-Jewish hate crimes also accounted for a majority of all religious

hate crimes in the United States. However, while the incidence of anti-Jewish

hate crimes increased in 2017 by 37%, the incidence of anti-Islamic hate crimes

decreased by 11%.

b. Since 2017, there have been even more tragic anti-Jewish hate crimes in the United States. Last week or so, a Jew was shot in front of a North Miami Beach synagogue. Numerous other violent attacks have taken place against Jews in various parts of the country. Just today the NYPD arrested Kenya Dean in connection with physical attacks on two religious Jews just before the start of the Sabbath. Of course, on October 27, 2018, during Sabbath morning services, a gunman murdered 11 people and wounded 7 others inside the Tree of Life Synagogue.

2. As pointed out in the letters you have received from California Jewish Legislative Caucus and from Tammi Rossman-Benjamin on behalf of 83 civil rights, human rights, religious and education organizations, the materials that are included in discussing other ethnic groups is replete with vicious antisemitic stereotypes and blatantly biased and pernicious anti-Israel messages.

Consequently, the Model Curriculum not only serves to indoctrinate young, vulnerable high school students with a particularly pernicious political perspective, but it also teaches them to accept antisemitic canards and libels.
Moreover, as the Rossman-Benjamin letter points out, several studies have shown that the use of these types of messages is materially correlated with an increased incidence of antisemitic actions on college campuses. The negative effect on a younger, less mature high school population could be even worse.
