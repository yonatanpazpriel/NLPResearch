First off I am not a racist and I am married outside of my own culture with a child of mixed race who I truly love. The notion that Capitalism is Racist is absurd. This is an ongoing attempt to teach Racial and Sexual/Gender Entitlement for Non White Male population. Calling Capitalism Racist in itself a political narrative for a far left wing controlled education system. Once the Capitalist money from the united states being sent to other countries is removed, the socialist programs like free health care and education are no longer sustainable. Sorry the socialist narrative is not working out for California. Or should I say its not working out for South America.
