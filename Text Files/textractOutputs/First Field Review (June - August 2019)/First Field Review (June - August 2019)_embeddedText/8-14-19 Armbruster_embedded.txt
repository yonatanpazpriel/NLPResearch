Dear Commission:
I applaud the overall effort to develop an ethnic studies curriculum, but I am distressed, anguished, angry over the slipshod treatment of Jews.
Please revise the model curriculum to (1) cover Anti-Semitism, specifically (1a) popular stereotypes of Jews, (1b) the Holocaust as a result of cultural Anti-Semitism, (1c) the refusal to accept Jewish refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe in the 1940's, (1d) recent mass shootings of Jews in the United States, and further to (2) present a variety of perspectives on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict.
Sincerely,
--Tom Armbruster, Ph.D.
