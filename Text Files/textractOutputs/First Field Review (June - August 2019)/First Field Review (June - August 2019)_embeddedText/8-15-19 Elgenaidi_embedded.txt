Introduction:
To whom it may concern,
Thank you for your invitation to comment on the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As an organization that has been working in the field of multi-cultural education for over 25 years, we applaud this effort and would like to raise the following suggestions. We have included detailed comments on the Curriculum at appropriate places in the document below, but here we would like to bring up some general points.
Our primary concern is the focus on only four groups, with Arab Americans apparently subsumed under Asian Americans and Jews not included at all.
First, as to Arab Americans, we know that they do not identify at all as Asian. I know because I am an Arab myself and I've never identified as Asian.
Arab Americans have been hard hit by prejudice, discrimination, and hate crimes, in part because they are identified as Muslims (even though many are not Muslim) and hence are targets of Islamophobia, and in part because of a denigration of Arabs that is deeply rooted in American and in Western culture generally. (For the former, see Council on American-Islamic Relations, Targeted: 2018 Civil Rights Report; for the latter, see Jack Sheehan, Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People, Olive Branch Press, 2014.) We believe, therefore, that Arab Americans should be included as one of the top-level foci in this Curriculum, with appropriate lesson plans that address Islamophobia and also the negative stereotyping that Arabs are subject to.

Second, as to Jews, we believe that, especially in view of rising anti-Semitism in the US, they also should be included among the toplevel groups in an ethnic studies curriculum. Jews are among the groups most heavily impacted by the increase in bias incidents and hate crimes over the past several years, dispelling any idea that anti-Semitism is marginal or dead. A report by the Anti-Defamation League showed that in 2017 the number of anti-Semitic incidents increased by 60% over the previous year, the largest single-year increase ever reported. Jews, moreover, understand themselves and are understood by others as an ethnic and cultural and not simply a religious group; there are many Jews who strongly assert their Jewish identity and participate in Jewish cultural and social organizations without participating in the religion of Judaism. We believe that omitting Jews in an ethnic studies curriculum would itself be, however unintentionally, an act of anti-Jewish bias.
Third, as to resources, we noted above that ING has for over a quarter of a century been working in intercultural, interethnic, and interreligious education and has produced considerable resources in that field. We find it surprising, therefore, that ING is not included among the resources in the Curriculum. We have indicated various resources of ours at appropriate points in the attached detailed comments, and we hope that you will take note of them and include them in the final version. We wish to point out especially our new Intercultural Speakers Bureau that directly addresses questions of race and ethnicity.
Finally, we wish to commend you for this vitally needed effort and for your openness to comments and participation. We believe that ethnic studies in schools are essential for equipping students to live in a multi-ethnic and multi-cultural society like the United States, and we want to support this effort in every way that we can.
Please feel free to call on our organization as subject matter experts to help you in the final draft of this model ethnic studies curriculum. We have many interfaith and ethnic allies and partners that would be more than willing to help support the final phase of the curriculum.
Thanks very much for your consideration.

p.40 � line 772: missing a word: on an in-depth study
p. 43 - line 856 and p. 45 line 887: what city is being referred to?
p. 47 � line 948: define Afrofuturism
p. 48 � line 970: great that you included these neo-Islamic movements (National of Islam, Moorish Science Temple) but good to also include Warith Deen Mohammed movement towards mainstream Islam that impacted large numbers until the present. p. 49 � line 986: great that you included Clara Mohammed but lesson should also include her husband Warith Deen Mohammed per above. Good to also add other Muslim notable African Americans, ie. Muhammad Ali, Kareem Abdul Jabbar and hiphop artists like Mos Def, Ice Cube p. 61 � lines 1282-1287: would make more sense to reverse the order, ie. explain the problem before looking at the attempts to address it. p. 69 � lines 1466 � 1468: these questions are very broad. It would be better look specifically at mass incarceration stats and after summarizing the stats arrive at their own conclusion. p. 73 � line 1563: no comma after Muhammad Ali
p. 75: it would be useful to include a lesson or summary about disparities in daily life such as education, healthcare, food, etc. p. 84 � line 1809: make question #3 the first question since it sets the background. p. 90 � line 1940: would be beneficial to ask a question about the specific underlying causes that lead to discontent and protest by students in East LA. p. 93 � line 2039: might be useful to first have the students discuss the demands and what they agreed or disagreed with. p. 97 � line 2134: Good to also have students reflect upon why this is important.

p. 98 � line 2159: Add: how does food reflect one's culture and values?
p.107 � line 2402: shouldn't this question be specific to El Salvador or South America? p. 113: Perhaps should emphasize that this exercise should allow the students to feel free to come up with their own ideas and policies without fear of repercussions if their policies appear to be at odds with the curriculum. p. 148: This was an excellent exercise which allows the students to allow the students to think deeper about these complicated issues and come to their own conclusions. p. 151 � line 3076: should be Hasan Minhaj. Could also include DJ Khaled and Rami Nashashibi or add them to section on Arabs. p. 171 � line 3538: It would make more sense to have Question #2 first.
p. 172 � line 3544: make this the first question and #4 the second question.
p. 173 � line 3579: useful to also ask: Why is this important? What does erasure do to a group's history and contributions? p. 174 � line 3592: Make this question #2.
p. 176 � line 3630 - central pacific railroad should be in caps; lines 3659-3663 could be worded better p. 181 � line 3783: to understand what the Hmong experience here in the U.S. What is the Hmong. Delete first highlighted word and add second. p. 183 � line 3823: add colon at the end of the sentence.
p. 184 � line 3846 � add semi-colon after males.
p. 187 � line 3940 � the language in this lesson could be improved.

p. 192 � line 3985 � no caps in "country;" line 3988 � two verbs: dropped, bombed; Cambodia, not Cambodian. The entire paragraph needs editing! Language in the next paragraph could also be improved. p. 193 � line 4024 � no caps in Flag.
p. 194 � line 4033: add hyphen in hand out; line 4043: remove "are". Line 40584060: sentence can be worded better. p. 209 � line 4398 � add "s" to resolution
p. 210 � lines 4400-4402: reverse the order of the questions; line 4411 no caps on Casinos. Might be good to note the downside of being involved in casinos. p. 215 � line 4510: reverse prompts a. and b. to match the order of the topics above. p. 233 � comprehensive and detailed introduction to the topic.
p. 235 � additional Arab notables include: Dr. Michael DeBakey, Dr. Elias Zerhouni, Ahmed Zewail, Paula Abdul, Dean Obeidallah, Shakira, Salma Hayek. https://www.aaiusa.org/famous-arab-americans p. 239 � line 5093: the instructions for this assignment were not clear. Line 5110 � the instructions in this paragraph do not specify if this if for an historical or contemporary immigrant. Might be useful for students to also write about the immigrant's challenges and opportunities. pp. 241-245 � both articles are clearly written and comprehensive but not sure why author's names aren't listed? p. 247 � line 5308: might add: How was his experience similar to or different from the experience of other immigrants at that time? p. 255 � line 2475: if not If; line 2491: along not a long.
p. 256 � line 5500: also an opportunity to discuss racisms between marginalized groups; line 5510 is an opportunity to discuss hybrid music and its purpose; commonalities between groups it underlines

p. 257 before line 5524 would be beneficial to have a discussion about hegemony and its various forms. p. 261 � line 5627 � delete "and". Line 5633 is an inspiring conclusion to the story! p. 271 � line 5857: suggest 3-5 examples as some students may not experience the same level of hegemony; p.272 � line 5866: 3-5 song titles. p. 272 � line 5878: provide more examples of hegemony for example that white male privileged students have experienced. p. 274 � line 5913: Lesson 3 should be the first lesson to set the background. Line 5923: comprehensive yet concise introduction and objectives. p. 276 � line 5962: note that these are old stats from 2002 so Christian-Muslim ratio will have shifted due to continuing immigration from Muslim-majority Arab countries. Excellent resources. Line 5978 � sentence needs editing. Line 5975 � should include notable American Muslims per other groups, ie. Ibtihaj Muhammad, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Dr. Oz. See https://ing.org/getting-toknow-american-muslims-and-their-faith-presentation/ slides 8-10 for additional examples. p. 277 � line 5992 � an excellent resource but might be jarring as an introduction to challenges and is more fitting in the lesson on Islamophobia. Line 5999: ING provides a digital presentation on Islamophobia which enumerates some of the challenges and their sources: https://ing.org/islamophobia-and-its-impact/

p. 278 � line 6033: ING provides curriculum about American Muslims and their faith: https://ing.org/getting-to-know-american-muslims-and-their-faith/ and their history in America: https://ing.org/a-history-of-muslims-in-america/ as well as their contributions globally: https://ing.org/muslim-contributions-to-civilization/ and an overview of Muslim Women Beyond the Stereotypes: https://ing.org/muslim-women-beyond-the-stereotypes/ all of which would be valuable additions to your curriculum and resources. The History of Muslims in America curriculum also has relevance in the previous lesson: African American Studies Course Outline as it relates to a number of topics on pp 48-49. ING also provides answers to over 100 common questions about Islam and Muslims: https://ing.org/top-100-frequently-asked-questions-about-muslims-and-their-faith/ ING has been providing education in schools for 26 years: https://ing.org/abouting/ p. 279 � line 6041 � caps on Islamophobia. Line 6068: some students may hesitate to admit they are Muslim or Arab for fear of bullying. p. 280 � line 6051: consider adding ING's digital presentation about Islamophobia also described below: https://ing.org/islamophobia-and-its-impact/ p. 281 � line 6056 � this article is dated.
p. 282 � line 6095 � caps on Islamophobia. Line 6100 � add impact of bullying on Muslim students. Great place for discussion of bullying generally and as it impacts this population and whether it occurs in this school and ways to prevent it. ING has a Bullying Prevention Guide: https://ing.org/bullying-prevention-guide/ as well as diverse resources for creating inclusive classrooms: https://ing.org/kyn-curriculum-educators/#classrooms

p. 283 � line 6108: Education is another approach to countering Islamophobia. ING has taken that approach for 26 years. https://ing.org/impact/

p. 285 � line 6183: ING has a comprehensive digital presentation and detailed notes with citations on the topic of Islamophobia as well as solutions: https://ing.org/islamophobia-and-its-impact/ which is an excellent reference on this topic. In light of rising Islamophobia Arab/Muslim Americans and Islamophobia should be a stand-alone group that incorporates the excellent lessons you already include. With the rise in anti-Semitism in recent years it would be useful to include some lessons about Jewish Americans similar to the ones about Arab/Muslims/Pacific Islanders Because of the potential exclusionary impact of these topics it is important that teachers be sensitive to those who might be cast as the oppressor, ie. white male students who are wealthy, children of police, etc. and potentially include language to that affect.
