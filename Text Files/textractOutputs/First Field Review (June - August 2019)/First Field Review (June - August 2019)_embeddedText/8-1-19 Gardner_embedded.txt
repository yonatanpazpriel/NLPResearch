We have entrusted the schools with the responsibility of teaching our children. We expected you to use logic and proven facts, things that would help prepare them to understand the world and thrive there in. And hopefully leave it a bit better for the next generation.
Capitalism and our free economy has served us well in our achievements thus far. Now, I understand, you want to tear apart the vehicle, "Capitalism", which has allowed our nation and others to thrive and lift millions out of poverty as well as promote and encourage the discovery of new medicines that fight diseases, machines which have made our lives fuller and easier, richer in more ways than I can begin to mention here.
I do not support this insane new curriculum that would confuse our kids about the value of capitalism.
Schools should teach our children facts and encourage critical thinking skills so that they can utilize those facts.
Yes when I say facts I'm talking about science and math, but also history, the arts and crafts. Building blocks which they can use to build fulfilling lives.
