From: send2herb Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Honorable members of the Ca Instructional Quality Committee
After reading the proposed ESMC I find it to be no less than Anti Semitic and a tool that will support division and hate in our California School. I have to believe that is NOT the intention of those who have worked on and are promoting this proposed curriculum.
To be as respectful as possible I voice my utmost opposition to the proposed ESMC. In spite of the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture and government -- and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination that the curriculum effectively erases the American Jewish experience in the State of California...
Please accept these comments as a sincere expression of my opposition to the ESMC.
