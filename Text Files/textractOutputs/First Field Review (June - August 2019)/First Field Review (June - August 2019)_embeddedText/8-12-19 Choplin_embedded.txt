From: Choplin, Jessica Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum
I lived in California for 13 years where I attended Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, San Jose State University, and UCLA where I earned my BS, MA, and Ph.D. degrees. I am writing to tell you that your proposed ethnic studies curriculum is abhorrent in its anti-Semitism. The subtext of this curriculum is that Jews cannot count on ever being safe in California and will need to seriously consider moving to Israel. I ask that you rewrite this proposed curriculum from scratch to include all oppressed groups and you need to list your first proposal as an example of how rampant anti-Semitism still is in the State of California.
