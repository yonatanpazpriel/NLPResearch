From: Donald Allen Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 4:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC AB 331
This proposed ESMC curriculum presents a grossly biased position promulgated by the hate-mongering, antisemitic BDS movement. In this post-holocaust world, It's glossary includes every imaginable form of prejudice except one, antisemitism. It does, however, include a long and favorable description of the hate-based, BDS movement. This level of biased propaganda should not be woven into the education of our young, future voters. It is reminiscent of Germany in the 1930's. The most recent FBI statistics show over three times the number of domestic U.S. antisemitic incidents annually as compared Islamophobic incidents. This should not be the case.
Sincerely,
Don and Susan Allen Redwood City, CA
