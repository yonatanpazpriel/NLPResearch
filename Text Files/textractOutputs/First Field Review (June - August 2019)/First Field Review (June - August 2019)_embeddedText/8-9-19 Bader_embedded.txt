The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

Please remove biased and anti-Israel material in sample lesson plans to provide better educational material for our children. As written the sample lessons are distorted and biased and will contribute to misinformation and inaccurate conclusions. The sample lesson plan calls for discussion of boycott, divest and sanction as well as the direct action front but provides no information on actors critical or

contrary to these perspectives nor provides any balance to a one sided and often inaccurate propaganda. The language implies that Israel (inaccurately called Israel-Palestine) is an Arab and completely ignores other groups that live in Israel. This section presents a single view of what happened in 1948 and accepts it as fact without addressing any of the other historical truths of what happened during the war in 1948. It portrays a biased view and does not address other valid aspects of what happened and why. The material includes a single song "somos sur" criticizing Israel and completely failing to address hegemonic issues within the Palestinian leadership throughout the past 50 years, up to and including the current Palestinian leadership. Instead of teaching about one culture, this material is mostly focused on "othering" a separate group. There is no material to provide information about Jews in America, a marginalized minority that has recently been suffering increased hate crimes. This minority is completely ignored allowing for increased misunderstanding and the spread of misinformation leading to future hate crimes.
