Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education --
I am extremely concerned about, and plan to broadly publicize my disapproval of, the fatally flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum as currently proposed.
While I of course support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class and promoting clear and constructive understanding among ethnic groups, especially amongst our younger generations, the treatment-omissions-misrepresentations of the Jewish people and the State of Israel within the curriculum is objectionable, harmful and blatantly biased.
At a time when hardly a week goes by without violence or attempted violence against Jews in America (another planned synagogue attack even this week as you are debating the Ethnic Curriculum), growing incidence of hate crimes against Jews and heightened vitriol against Jews by national political leaders across the American landscape, it's all the more unthinkable that California would not take a leadership stance in promoting better understanding of the Jewish community within an ethnic studies curriculum supposedly designed to do exactly that.
Along with many, many other fellow citizens of California, I exhort you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
To do less or to do nothing would not only be a serious mistake, it would render this curriculum and those who developed it and promote it, complicit in the cancerous spread of Anti-Semitism rife in our current political climate.
Thank you for your attention to this critical matter and for your consideration.
Sincerely, Benjamin Baum CA citizen, Volunteer-Supporter-Donor to CA public schools and Parent of Students in CA public schools, and member of the CA Jewish community
