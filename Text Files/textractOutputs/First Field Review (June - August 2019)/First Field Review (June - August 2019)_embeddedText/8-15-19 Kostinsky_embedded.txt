The goals behind the proposal for an Ethnic Studies curriculum are worthy:

55-year CA resident "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students

retired CA State

to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the

University professor eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."

But this concept of a mandatory high school Ethnic Studies curriculum has been hijacked for the

purpose of completely one-sided political indoctrination which directly contradicts the stated goals

of the curriculum.

It is alarming that a curriculum proposed for all California high school students - - purportedly seeking to eradicate hate- - would effectively promote antisemitism. The curriculum as now proposed promotes hatred and silencing of Jews or others who want to discuss, or even present for consideration, pro-Israel views.

It is alarming to see BDS described in glowing terms when the U.S. Congress has passed the Combating BDS Act of 2019. It must be made clear that BDS seeks the elimination of Israel, despite ambiguous/misleading descriptions like that in the GLOSSARY of this proposal, descriptions that allow for a wide range of interpretations. Omar Barghouti, co-founder of BDS and a pre-eminent spokesperson for it, has said: Definitely most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine.
(Separately he clarifies that "Palestine" means all of Israel.)

But more relevant to the current proposal, BDS and the very complex, international IsraeliPalestinian conflict are dragged into this proposal with no serious examination/debate. Given the stated goals of the curriculum, probably they should not be here at all.

Further, The proposed curriculum violates its "inclusion" goal by omitting any significant mention of The American Jewish minority � its culture, traditions, contributions. Nor does the proposed curriculum include the rise in harassment, threats and lethal violence (Poway and Pittsburgh) against the American Jewish minority (against a long historical background of antisemitic attacks).
