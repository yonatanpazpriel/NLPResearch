Dear California State Board of Education:
Why would your Ethnic Studies Program in the name of "diversity" promote Omar Barghouti's antisemitic genocidal BDS movement? Barghouti, the cofounder of BDS, is very forthright is saying the SOLE purpose of BDS is the euthansia of of the Zionist dream of Israel. A Zionist dream that includes the fact that Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in the Old Testament and not once in the Koran. A student of history, Barghouti knows full well that the Nazi T4 Euthanasiav Program was the foundation of the Final Solution of the Jews as enacted in the Wannsee Protocol in January 1942. His use of the word euthanasia leaves no doubt he co-founded BDS to continue the antisemitic eliminationist mission formalized by Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann at the Wannsee Conference. The question now is why is the California Ethnic Studies Program joining hands with Heydrich, Eichmann and Barghouti in promoting the same antisemitic eliminationist program they represent? It is not about diversity. It is about virulent genocidal Anti-Semitism. For shame. Richard Sherman
