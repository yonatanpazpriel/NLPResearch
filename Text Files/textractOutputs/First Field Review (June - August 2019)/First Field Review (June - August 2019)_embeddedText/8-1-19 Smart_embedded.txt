I would like to register my opposition to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. After review, I believe the curriculum to be an overtly political attempt to create a caste system in our public schools, and I believe the result will be to drive wedges between various ethnicities in California. Our goal should be to find commonalities, not isolate and highlight differences. This will do our children an incredible dis-service and further degrade our already sub-par schools. Please DO NOT proceed with approval.
