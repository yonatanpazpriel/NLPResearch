As a trustee of a large urban school district in California, I implore you to carefully and compassionately evaluate the ethnic studies curriculum. Every effort should be made to allow students to appreciate the experiences of all ethnicities, marginalized groups, and minorities. It is our responsibility to our children to ensure that this curriculum is thoughtfully evaluated. Any curriculum that might inadvertently perpetuate hate or discrimination against any group is certainly doing more harm than good. Have all stakeholders at the table before finalizing any curriculum; to proceed without those voices could be highly problematic-both politically and ethically. Thank you, Dr. Roberta A. Perlman
