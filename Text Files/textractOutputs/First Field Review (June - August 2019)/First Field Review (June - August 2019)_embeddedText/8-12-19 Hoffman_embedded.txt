From: Randy Hoffman Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 6:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am quite dismayed with the proposed ethnic curriculum for it fails to display anything related to Jewish American experience. There is nothing about anti Semitic . There are there are many thousands of Middle Eastern Jews who have been displaced and are not mentioned in this curriculum. I am uncomfortable with the lack of accurate information about the history of Israel. Biased and inaccurate information about the origin of Israel is also evident. My family has lived in California for many years supporting the public schools as a parent of 3 in addition to being a school volunteer and an educator myself. This curriculum is inaccurate and misleading.
