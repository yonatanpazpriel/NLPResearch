From: Pam Levine Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am shocked and deeply disappointed in the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. The Curriculum does not include anti-semitism, the plight of Jewish Americans, but included the biased BDS. It can only increase the unsafe and threatened nature of American Jewish students.
The section on "Arab American Studies Course Outline" contains multiple calls for the hatred of Israel, Palestinian border studies, and praises of figures who are associated with antisemitic and anti-Zionist rhetoric. The curriculum refers to the concept of referring to the establishment of the State of Israel as a "catastrophe" and includes songs and poems that are riddled with antisemitic tropes such as equating Jews to all Israelis and saying that Jews control the media. It ignores the multiple International contributions of Israelis and Jewish people in medicine, technology, agriculture and other numerous areas.
"This is nothing more than an attempt by fringe activists to hijack the model ethnic-studies curriculum for California high schools in the service of radical political goals," noted Seth Brysk, the Anti-Defamation League's central pacific regional director. The proposed California curriculum has the potential to be extraordinarily dangerous for the American Jewish community. This curriculum is in violation to the statues and guideline for writing the curriculum to foster positive feelings among various ethnic groups.
I urge a major and more sensitive, factual revision of the proposed curriculum.
Thank you, Pamela Levine
