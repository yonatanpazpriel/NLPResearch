entire document

�

I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the

ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1,

Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized

communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.

�

I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline

the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab

Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination

and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.

�

Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is

necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab

Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge

between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a

growing population.
