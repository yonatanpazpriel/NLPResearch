From: Selma Soss Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Dear Staff,
I wish to express my disgust at the ethnic studies curriculum that erases so much that Jewish people have contributed in California, as well as the country, and throughout the world. The Ethnic Studies Curriculum omits the suffering Jewish people have endured in the Holocaust and throughout history, promotes the BDS movement, and singles out Israel for special condemnation. I hope that your ethnic studies program will correct its agenda.
