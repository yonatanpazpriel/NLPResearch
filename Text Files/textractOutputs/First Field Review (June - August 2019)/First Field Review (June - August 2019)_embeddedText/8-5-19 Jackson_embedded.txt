In Unit 2, the suggested listing of systems of power includes Capitalism along with terms such as colonialism, imperialism, and other appellations characterizing abuses of governmental power. Capitalism, which provides private citizens, not the government, the opportunity to take advantage of avenues to private economic power - does not belong in this group. And no mention is made of communism - possibly the most abusive governmental system of all. This is clearly promoting a political agenda. It places the entire document in serious doubt as to its appropriateness as an educational proposal.
