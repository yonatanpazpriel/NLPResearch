From: Rodney Howell Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 10:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New curriculum
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am opposed to the new curriculum you are proposing due to it's lack of concern for Jewish interests and pro-BDS stance. I don't think this is appropriate for children.
Thank you,
Rod Howell
