Page 2 of the Glossary/Bibliography, as well as pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of Chapter 2: Sample Course Models.
I find the representation of Israel in this model to be incomplete and biased. A textbook should include a true recount of events, to be sure -- in this case the Palestinian origins of the land now occupied by Israelis. Just as a textbook should include the genocide of Native Americans that followed the Lewis and Clark expedition, or the slaughter of the Aboriginals in Australia as the British settlers colonized. But to teach an explicitly anti-Israel stance in current times, to express an opinion about the actions our leaders or the leaders in the middle east should take moving forward -- that's a political stance. That's for students to develop on their own, not to be taught.
