It would far better to return to a traditional program based on history, civics, factual info unbiased by what some very biased academic feels to be "politically correct." Providing a factual, unbiased education would provide a better basis for students than the current curriculum, which does not appear to provide a good basis in US history, civics and government, or other factual based coursework that adequately prepares the current generation to deal with life. Further, religion, has been removed from schools and living, in general, although this country was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. Ethnic studies, based on current "politically correct principles" would have to be considered as total nonsense by any truly educated thinking person.
