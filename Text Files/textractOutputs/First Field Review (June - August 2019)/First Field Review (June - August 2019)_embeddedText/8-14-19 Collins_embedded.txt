From: Jerry Collins Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 3:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Fwd: ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
I am concerned about the content and purpose of the subject curriculum. It appears to me to be more of an indoctrination into socialism and leftist thinking than teaching our children what is needed to to be a positive influence on society and life in general. Capitalism is what our country has used to be very successful and profitable and is not raciest. It allows ambition and hard work to pay off for any and all that are willing to work hard, take risk and dream the American dream. I urge you and respectfully request the you cancel this Ethnic Studies Curriculum and concentrate instead on teaching our children basic skills of reading, writing and arithmetic so they can be successful in life and be a positive contributor to our society.
Respectfully: Jerry I Collins
