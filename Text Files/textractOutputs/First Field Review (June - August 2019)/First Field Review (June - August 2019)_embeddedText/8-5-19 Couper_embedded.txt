Chapter 2

Page 2 of Glossary and Bibliography, as well as pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of Chapter 2: Sample Course Models. I am requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum which promotes hate and division.

Lessons need to be added about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled and died in the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. The proposed curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism raising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is very deeply disappointing and concerning. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum encourages teachers to highlight BDS and pro-BDS group, Direct Action For Palestine, but there are no voices critical of their perspectives (p.234). It promotes a false equivalence between Israels's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p 234). It uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestinine" as a whole is an Arab country (p 237). It frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact with no alternative perspectives p. 242). And it encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders )p.256, 264-269).

As a grandmother with five grandchildren in the California School system this is very concerning that this bias is being promoted. Respectfully, Carol Couper
