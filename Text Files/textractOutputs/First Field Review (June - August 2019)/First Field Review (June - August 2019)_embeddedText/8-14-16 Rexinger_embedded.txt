Capitalism is NOT racism. Public schools should only be teaching reading & writing. Public schools are for the public, not just for the snowflakes of socialism.
Shame on you for demonizing the free market. Children should be given choices. No one should be forced only 1 point of view.
Stop the indoctrination. Stop the hate.
