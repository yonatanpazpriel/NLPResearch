To Whom It May Concern, Prior to this afternoon, I was uninformed of this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum proposal. I spent my lunch hour trying to digest the exorbitant amount of information and sadly, after only reading the introduction, I was so incredibly upset over the content and continued segregation that this proposal, if approved, would initiate, that I had to stop reading. First, let me introduce myself, I am a 46 year old mother of 3, but have raised 5 children that have all attended public schools in California, I own 2 tax-paying businesses in California, I am multi-ethnic and my children are as well, including one that has Chinese ancestry, I came from a very social-economically challenged family, raised by a single mother, in a small town in Central California, and an a college graduate. My best friend since 6th grade is a gay cop, and my favorite cousin is a lesbian, married to a wonderful woman and they are expecting their first child. I have friends and family from every socio-economic, gender specific (*and non-specific groups), from virtually every race, country and immigration status. There is no one on this earth that will tell you that I have any issues with race, creed, color, gender identity or ethnicity. That being said, I am in full opposition of this proposal. I can begin with some notes I took from the initial pages that I read of the proposed change in our curriculum. Note 1 : Introductions lines 5-18 I do not agree with changing our language to HXSTORY, as this further perpetuates any divide, however large or small that exists. You are attaching additional meaning to words that have never before the last few years been identified, question, queried, nor reflected any gender specificity. It is asinine for a language to be devoted to gender dis-identification to justify a temper tantrum by a very small selection of the population. According to the Williams Institute in 2011 only 8% of our population is gay/transgender/unidentified. Let's say it goes up to 13%, that is still a minority, and of that 13%, what percentage of those are actually hurt/disenfranchised/mistaken within that. Lets assume 50% of those adhere to the ideology that "HIStory" should be HXstory or HERStory. I cannot fathom changing and eradicating historical words (no pun intended) to appease the 7010% that it effects. This world is a constantly evolving platform, full of justices and injustices. I find these changes in requested terminology to be

completely abhorrent and unnecessary. I do not want to discount the needs, desires or feelings of those that feel oppressed by words, but I believe education on the meaning, definition, history, and even the origins of the words would be of better use of our students' time. The continued focus on the few instead of society at large, is to me, a continued split of our society, focusing on racist, adrenophobic and disingenuous integration of our society. Continued division is adding to bigotry of men, hate of the traditional "family," heterosexuality, and the decline open communication. Note 2 : Defining Ethnic Studies Pp 20-171 Let me ask, yet again, why would any society want to continue to further separate it's inhabitants? Immigrants, gay/straight/trans/multi-culture should not be called attention to. One harmonious society based on the benefit of all. There will never be an utopian society, however, one where we are constantly bombarded with the division, rather than the inclusion, would continually perpetuate a chasm between the ethnicities and society in general. My daughter, although fair skinned, with blonde hair and green eyes, which is the direct opposite of me, having dark hair, medium dark skin and brown eyes, is identified as a "white female". This, although partially true, is not a full description of her ethnicities. I want her to learn all of her culture(s) from her roots in England, Ireland, Jamaica... as well as adding her other siblings' background from China, Germany and parts yet unknown. I want my children taught world history, as long and far as our ability to gather the information. There is no need to change history, it is as it happened, not as we want to "pretend" or change it to be. The Holocaust existed, the Vietnam War occurred, Japanese immigrants spent time in concentration camps on US soil, the US bombed Hiroshima, the US was integral in the bringing down of the Berlin Wall... the examples could continue for pages, but what I want to focus on is that it is history, not her-story, not HXstory... or any other neologism you want to insert, should be taught without the need to identify a gender/non-gender term. This perpetuates additional discourse and separation. Not to mention, I find it simply without merit. In World History class, our students study our past, cultures and ancestors. We do not need to continue this narrative into English, band, math or any other classes. Culture should be taught during our World History Classes and left there. We are trying to be inclusive, make our country the melting-pot that it once had been seen as, and yet this document glaringly separates everyone, making a mockery of our attempts at full immersion and inclusion. This rhetoric has to stop. I would further like to point out that there has been an increase in college graduates focusing on Ethnic Studies and yet a decrease in hiring of individuals with college degrees. Could there be a direct correlation to the focus on something that is not culturally helpful and the declining rate of hires? According to dataus.io there has been a 2.8% decrease in the workforce for Cultural & Genders studies graduates. Of the 11 individuals that I personally know that have Bachelors' degrees in Ethnic or Gender studies, only 3 are currently employed in their field of choice. If it is true that there is a decline in hiring of individuals with college degrees in any given field, then why would we be looking at devoting more education toward that? Why not bring back shop classes, engineering classes, home economics classes, business classes, accounting classes, and other useful classes that could assist our high school graduates in learning & maintaining employable skills. I could spend hours in front of my computer, citing multiple website, indoctrinating you on this continued and biased divide, but alas, I have a job to do, a family to cook for, a house to pay for, taxes to pay and friends businesses to support. I am a female, single mother, lover of my friends, family and strangers and I am deeply opposed to the School Boards teaching this drivel to our children. I beg you to please remove this petition from the agenda. It does not help our state, our country, our students, our teachers, staff and others to become a more cohesive society. Unification is where we want to head. This is more and more and more division. Sincerely,
