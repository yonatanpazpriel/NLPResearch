From: Steve Peppercorn Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Against Proposed Curricula
To whom it may concern: I have been informed of proposed ethnic studies curricula and am concerned it has an anti-Israel bias as well as antisemitic undertone. Please allow your new curricula to be reviewed by the AIPIC and ADL to find out first. Thank you. -SP
