From: Desiree Collings Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 9:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject:
As a lifelong Californian I am writing to state my absolute rejection of this proposed ethnic studies curriculum. Your proposed curriculum is biased, extremely divisive, presents a distorted view and is an inappropriate use of taxpayer funds.
A curriculum that aims to "cultivate empathy" should not teach one group's view without educating students about the other views of the same events. STUDENTS SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO UNDERSTAND CONFLICTS, NOT TAKE SIDES IN THEM.
In this proposed curriculum, you are teaching ethnic studies as a proxy for anti-Western indoctrination. Teaching high school students that capitalism is oppression, without examining the outcomes of some of history's other paths, is not education. It is leftist propaganda.
Educate students about their common heritage as Americans and the power of freedom to improve the lives of people everywhere. Teach students to think for themselves, encouraging students to consider multiple viewpoints.
