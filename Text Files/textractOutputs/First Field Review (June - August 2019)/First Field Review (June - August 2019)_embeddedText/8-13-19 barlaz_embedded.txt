Your proposed curriculum makes a mockery of education. It is an anti-Jewish, anti-Israel agenda. How sad that those who should be concerned with educating young people are obsessed with engendering hatred of Israel and the Jewish people with no regard for the truth. Teach history, not Nazi-inspired lies. If you would like a real history of the Middle East I refer you to FROM TIME IMMEMORIAL by Joan Peters. It will amaze you.
I also fail to understand how a curriculum that is called Ethnic Studies does not include a section of the Jewish people. Are we not a minority, albeit a very small one numerically. Deny our existence but we will not go away.
How do you totally ignore anti-semitism when you describe many types of prejudice? Anti-Jewish incidents are far more prevalent than ant-Muslim incidents but you just make believe that they don't exist. I suppose that in your Jew-free world they don't.
Your curriculum is a model of all that is wrong in this world. Fake news, fake curriculum. Truth is dead. Facts have no relevance in the neo-nationalist, socialist state of California.
A very disillusioned educator
