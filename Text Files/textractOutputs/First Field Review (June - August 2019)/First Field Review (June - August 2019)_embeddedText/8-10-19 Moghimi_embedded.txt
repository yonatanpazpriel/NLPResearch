hi as a long time california tax payer and product of your public education system, i am writing you to inform you how disappointed i am in regards to the proposed curriculum of your ethnic studies program.... the point of these studies is to bring people together and bring about mutual appreciation of different cultures. unfortunately, this particular curriculum will further put a divide of "us against them" in the impressionable minds of our students. furthermore, i find it to be extremely biased and discriminatory against jewish people and the state of israel- if you don't believe me, please read assemblyman jose medina's letter shredding the curriculum this curriculum needs to be revised in order to benefit the future of all californians, not just a few who wish to advance their own political agenda
yours, arash moghimi
