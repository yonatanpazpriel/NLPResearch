Given that the state of California has seen fit to make laws that ban the state from contracting with entities that support Palestinian rights by means of boycotts of Israel, I think it's entirely appropriate that high school students receive education on the subject, in particular education presenting the other point of view from the officials who passed that law, that is, why boycotts of Israel are called for by the ethnic group who are the main victims of Israel's policy. While some study of anti-semitism should probably be added to the curriculum, I don't find the present curriculum anti-semitic whatsoever. I fully understand why supporters of Israel want anything that puts Israel in a bad light banned from public education - they do so by perverting the truth, calling any call for justice for Palestinians anti-semitic, or passing laws that interfere with people's freedom of speech - such as the anti-BDS law. Public schools have a duty to teach facts. If teaching both points of view is a goal, then by banning teaching about BDS you're only teaching one side.

In summary, add a module on anti-semitism, keep the modules on Palestinian or Arab American ethnicity as is.
