Hopefully, your curriculum includes something about for example, the approximately 2 million Cambodians that died in the late 70's. Deviant and nationalistic form of Marxism that Pol Pot and company thought up that combined Marxism learned from academics in Paris and Khmer nationalism. Big Brother #2 just died the other day. You should also cover the five-year plan from the late 50's and early sixties where another nationalistic form of Marxism led a famine and starvation by an estimated 30 million Chinese. Cultural revolution in late 60's killed another 4-6 million. Academics were forced to work on communes because Mao did not like or trust them as a new elite. And where to start with Stalin. Pretty close to Hitler in the number of people who died from yet another form of Marxism. Oh I forgot, North Korea speaks for itself. Marxism seems like one of those things that might, well not really, good in theory but bad in practice
