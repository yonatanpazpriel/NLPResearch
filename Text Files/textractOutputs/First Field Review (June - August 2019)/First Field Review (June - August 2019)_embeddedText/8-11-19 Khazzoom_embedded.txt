Sirs:
My name is J Daniel Khazzoom. I am a retired Faculty from San Jose State University, Stanford University and University of California Berkeley.
I am writing about the new proposed model ethnic studies curriculum, which is intended to be used in all California public high schools. If a pending bill (AB 331) is approved by the California legislature, all students will be required to take at least one course based on this curriculum to graduate.
I am writing to state that the proposed curriculum is antisemitic and antiIsrael. It omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies BDS, and is blatantly antiIsrael.
While fixing this curriculum is critical, I believe that the California Department of Education must first establish safeguards to ensure that the curriculum writers are prohibited from hijacking the curriculum to promote their own political agendas. An educational curriculum must not be used as an antisemitic or anti-Israel tool to indoctrinate students and promote hate against any race, religion, individual or group.
I urge you to reject the proposed biased curriculum. I also urge you to establish safeguards for ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and all other state-sponsored curriculum and instructional material establish safeguards for ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, as well as all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race , religion group or individual.
Best, J Daniel Khazzoom, PhD
