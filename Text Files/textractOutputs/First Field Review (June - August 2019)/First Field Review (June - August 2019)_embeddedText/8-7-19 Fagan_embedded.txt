Including BDS in the lesson plan will encourage instilling of hate in the students against Jews. We shouldn't encourage our children to boycott democratic countries that are not oppressing its citizens. Perspectives of the Jews and Israel should be included in the document to ensure a fair, unbiased discussion of any and all issues. Just showing one side of an argument isn't fair.
