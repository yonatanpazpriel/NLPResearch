From: Chris Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 10:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Educational Guidelines
I find your new educational guidelines to be disturbing at best and simply outrageous. To disparage capitalism which has given citizens of this nation freedom and a path to a free and happy life is wrong. Stop putting current political talking points in a curriculum that needs to stand the test of time. Education needs to be neutral; not an editorial. Sent from my mobile telephone.
