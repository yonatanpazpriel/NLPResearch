From: Kathryn Kirui Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 1:30 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please Safeguard Against Politicization of CA Curricula.
Dear People of CRIFD,
The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for California high schools is considered to have failed to teach about the presence of, the contributions of, and the ongoing challenges faced by the minority of people (of all colors) in our state who live as Jews.
This curriculum is also considered to be politically biased in its treatment of the country of Israel.
While it's clear that a well-informed re-write of the current draft's curriculum is needed, the problem goes beyond the issues with one particular curriculum.
Please act to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other statesponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you very much for taking action to ensure this very essential protection for academic integrity, fairness, democracy and good education.
