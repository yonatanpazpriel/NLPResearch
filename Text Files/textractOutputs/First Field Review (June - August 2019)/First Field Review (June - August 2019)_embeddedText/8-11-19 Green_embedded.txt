As a taxpayer, a patriot, and a Jewish-American, I oppose the proposed change to California's educational curriculum. Your proposed exclusion of the contributions of Jewish people to science, medicine, communications, history, culture, government and politics is offensive. Your insensitivity to the special nature of the long-standing discrimination against Jewish people for centuries is offensive. Your omission of curriculum covering anti-Semitism is in itself a contribution to the rise of anti-Semitism and is deplorable. The curriculum denigrates Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East, and the Jewish people. The curriculum supports the anti-Semitic BDS movement, a movement just condemned by Congress. Please do not disgrace our state in this manner.
