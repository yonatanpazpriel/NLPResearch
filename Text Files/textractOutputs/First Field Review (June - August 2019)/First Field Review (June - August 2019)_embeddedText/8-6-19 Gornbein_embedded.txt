It is of great concern that the BDS movement is defined and discussed in an entirely one sided manner favoring only the Palestinian narrative. This implies that there is no controversy, only that one side is admirable and the other is not. It is clearly taking sides. There seems to be little or no mention of non Muslim experiences in this section. It does not mention Coptic, Bahai, Kurdish, Mizrachi Jewish or Yazidi peoples. The language is not very inclusive or supportive.
