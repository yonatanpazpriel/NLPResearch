From: Darren Warner Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 2:24 PM To: Darren Warner Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As a California resident I was horribly distressed to hear about the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum that is promoting anti-Semitism and hatred of the Jewish State. Specifically pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256 and 264-269 that promote the BDS movement and other anti-Jewish hate movements. In short, Ethnic Studies has been taken over by advocates who are abusing the curriculum to push their narrow agenda. That isn't what education is about. Their underhanded and one-sided efforts will only cause division and contribute to a worsening situation regarding Jews in California (already the victims of the most religious hate crimes in CA). We should be teaching tolerance, love and inclusion not spreading more hate and racism. This curriculum does the complete opposite. I cannot request that you reject this proposal passionately enough!
Thank you for your consideration,
