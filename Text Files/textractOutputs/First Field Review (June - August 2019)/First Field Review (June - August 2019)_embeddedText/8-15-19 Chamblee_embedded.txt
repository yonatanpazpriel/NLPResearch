I believe ethnic studies are very important. However, my concern is that it is not inclusive in this format offered. It should be focused on combating ALL racism, not only white supremacy. By focusing solely on white supremacy, the course gives the impression that the only form of racism that is negative is when it comes from white people. This is not true, and unfairly singles out all the white children for suspicion from any minorities. It furthers the division, when instead, we should all be standing together to combat ALL racism coming from ANY group, from ANY ethnicity.
