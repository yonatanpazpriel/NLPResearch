From: Sandy Silver Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Concern Regarding Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I urge you to make revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that are consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As the parent of two teenagers who attend California public high school, I am appalled at the thought that my children would be taught from a lesson book that reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews and
institutionalizes the teaching of anti-semitic stereotypes. This is indefensible in light of rising anti-semitism in America and especially on college campuses.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Sandy Silver
