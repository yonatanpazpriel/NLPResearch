From: Fred Hayward Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 7:03 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti-Semitic curricula
I have resided in California for 35 years. My children all attended public schools, and my six grandchildren are currently in public schools here.
I am appalled by the anti-Semitic strain running through a proposed curriculum on Ethnic Studies. It fails to include Jews, but far worse than that, it has an anti-Semitic slant.
I have heard many rationales for the BDS (Boycott/Divest/Sanction) Movement, but have never heard a single one that was not blatantly anti-Semitic due to its singling out of Israel for alleged offenses that are far worse in other countries (countries who are, of course, not targets of BDS). The founder of the BDS Movement is very open about the ultimate goal: the destruction of the entire nation of Israel -- our best ally and the one democracy in the Middle East.
You need to do more than fix this proposal. You need to set up reforms so that this kind of hijacking of curricula never happens again and students receive education, not indoctrination, in our public schools.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, Fred Hayward
