To whom it may concern
I'm reaching out to you as a concerned parent. I recently became aware of the curriculum changes you are working on in the topic of ethnic studies. I highly appreciate the opportunity to give feedback on it, thank you for that!
My concern is, as an Israeli-American parent, that if these changes will be approved my child will study in an unsafe and uncomfortable environment. There are various parts in the curriculum that are very anti-Israel, one-sided, biased and generally it does not mention Jews being a minority.
I really am very worried and I ask you with deepest respect to please pay attention to my concern.
thank you! Sharon Zhar
