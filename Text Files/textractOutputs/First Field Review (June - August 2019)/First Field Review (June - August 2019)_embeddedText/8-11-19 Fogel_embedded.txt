From: David Fogel Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very much upset by the proposed flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
