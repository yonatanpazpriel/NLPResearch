2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This curriculum for schools is reprehensible. To allow this state to teach anti-semitic values to our children using our tax dollars is a complete disgrace. Who is coming up with this crap? As a Jewish-American citizen, I will not stand by while the Jewish people are being smeared in the Main Stream Media, Congress and now in our schools. I have 2 boys and I will not allow it! The United States has no greater ally in the world than Israel. This curriculum is shameful! Shame on all of you for even bringing this hateful ideology into the classroom and passing it off as teaching. And you wonder why the tax dollars are being taken away from public schools and given to homeschoolers! This is disgusting! My grandfather had to escape the concentration camps in Russia and came to Ellis Island to find his freedom. He gladly became an American Citizen and overwhelmingly loved, honored and served this country until his last breath. This is an abomination. Even the Bible says that God 'will bless those who bless Israel and curse those who curse Israel.' Genesis 12:3
Please, I am begging you to reconsider!
