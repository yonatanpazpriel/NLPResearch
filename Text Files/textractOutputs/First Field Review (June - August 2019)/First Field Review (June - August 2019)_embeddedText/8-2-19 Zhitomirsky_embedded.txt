I am in shock. Where are the Jewish names of the proposed co-authors of this curriculum? It's a shame to feed into the already on the rise antisemitism.
The curriculum pits Jews against other ethnic groups, evokes age-old stereotypes, and explicitly excludes Jews as an ethnic minority, despite an unprecedented rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The drafted curriculum only mentions Jews four times, including a reference to a Jewish businessman in relation to success and property rights, an insinuation that Jews are responsible for Arab displacement after the "Nakba," and more.
