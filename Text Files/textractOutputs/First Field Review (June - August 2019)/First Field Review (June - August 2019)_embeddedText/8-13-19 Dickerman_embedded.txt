From: Dickerman, Scott Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 9:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on Proposed Ethnic Studies Framework
To Whom It May Concern;
My comments on the proposed Ethnic Studies Framework centers on the fact that much of it looks like it is based heavily on Critical Race Theory. Critical Race Theory is garbage! Thus the proposed framework is garbage!
Critical Race Theory is garbage because it is highly ideological and grossly oversimplified, relying on a lot of neo-Marxist buzzwords that explain nothing. Critical Race Theory relies on explanations based on "systems of power," blithely brushing aside that these "systems" are the product of the collective psychology of many, many individuals over many generations, and it focuses on the "systems" rather than taking a serious look at what it is about our brains makes us do things that have the effect of being oppressive.
The state needs to find a different group of consultants to draw up a new framework, and the new consultants should not be the usual crackpots and academic fringe players who embrace garbage like Critical Race Theory. The framework instead must not only teach how race relations and our attitudes about race have shaped US history, but the curriculum should delve into what shaped these attitudes as well as how the resulting "systems" have impeded progress toward full equality. And explanations should stay away from neo-Marxist buzzwords as much as possible.
