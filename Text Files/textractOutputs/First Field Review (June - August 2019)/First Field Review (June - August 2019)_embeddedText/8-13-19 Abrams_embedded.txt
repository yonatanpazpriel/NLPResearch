Dear Committee members, More than half of all domestic terrorism in the US this past year has been aimed at Jews! This is far more than has been aimed at Muslims -- and yet your curriculum ignores Jews as a threatened ethnic group while it seeks to protect Muslims. It also calls the founding of Israel by the name the Palestinians give it -- the catastrophe -- while ignoring the fact that the same catastrophe happened to the Jews in all the countries surrounding Israel (not to mention Germany). They were thrown out of all Arab countries, lost their possessions and lands, and had nowhere to go but Israel. I am a Jewish American and am frankly shocked at the blatant bias of your curriculum. I have nothing against Muslims or any other group in California, but I do feel strongly that the imbalance in your approach will only harm Jewish students in our State and encourage more anti-Semitic thinking and behavior. The California Legislative Jewish Caucus has recommended changes and I STRONGLY urge you to accept them. Sincerely, Nancy Ellen Abrams
