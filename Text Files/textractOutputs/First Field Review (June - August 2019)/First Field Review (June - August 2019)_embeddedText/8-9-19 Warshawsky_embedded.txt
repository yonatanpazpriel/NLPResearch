P. 2, Line 30� It is deeply disturbing to see the Global BDS Movement dangerously misconstrued as a "social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" while ignoring the movement's anti-Semitic and anti-peace foundation and goals. According to it's founder, BDS's goal is to isolate, delegitimize and ultimately destroy the Jewish state. The BDS movement is inevitably, if not inherently anti-Semitic in so far as it holds the Jewish State to standards to which no other nation are held, collectively penalizes all Israelis for the policies of certain elected leaders, neglects the role of all other parties in perpetuating the conflict, and denies Israel its sovereign right to defend its citizens. The definition for BDS provided in the Model Curriculum is a na�ve slant which seeks to characterize BDS as a peaceful social justice movement, but the Department of Education does not promote justice, knowledge, or diversity by glossing over BDS's hateful underpinnings. I hope the department will consider a definition that provides more nuance to the curriculum.
