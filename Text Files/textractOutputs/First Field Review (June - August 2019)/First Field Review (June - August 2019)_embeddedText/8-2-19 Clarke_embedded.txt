My comments are general, after only reading lesson samples 1 and 2, which I was happy to see how well thought out and comprehensive they were.
1. As a grant writer I work with agencies whose mission is at-risk youth (African American and Latino mostly and foster care youth). In samples 1 and 2, my foster care youth will not be able to relate any experiences, as 90% grow up in many group homes or non-family foster homes. Recent immigrants may find redlining a "foreign" concept. My point is not the subject matter, but that when educators use any subject theme, they will be careful to be sensitive to the experiences of their students as well as their culture.
2. Regarding the Committee, I reviewed the list in the hopes of seeing how diverse the members were, because the assumption is each would bring their personal experiences to the Ethnic Studies model. Last names are not a true indicator.

prevalent in my 1970s college days. Don't know what is going on now, but debates are a great devise to bring divergent groups together to work in unity and for a common cause. Perhaps this element can be added to one of the lesson samples, if it has not already. 4. Finally, kudos to returning ethnic studies to the classroom, I minored in Black History in college. If implemented, classrooms and schools will see a paradigm shift to calmer, friendlier, more tolerant students as they begin to understand and work with peers for the greater good, rather than intolerance. 5. Thank you for opening this opportunity up for general input.
