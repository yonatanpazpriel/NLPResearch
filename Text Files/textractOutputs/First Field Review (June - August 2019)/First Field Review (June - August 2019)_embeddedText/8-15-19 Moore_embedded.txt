It is unconscionable that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ignores the Jewish people in the United States, Israel, and worldwide. The Jewish people are, in general, brilliant and industrious; their contributions are many. Israel is not only disregarded, but consistently referred to as "Palestine" or "Palestine/Israel". This language is despite an undisputed wealth of historical, archeological, legal and Biblical evidence for the ancient and modern state of Israel. At the center of all this history is a group of people who are the world's most persecuted. The global rise of anti-Semitism is a current and critical concern.

Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism are beliefs or behaviors of hostility toward Jews just because they are Jewish. It comes from many sources and takes many different forms, from religious teachings that proclaim the inferiority of Jews, or political agendas to ostracize and isolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. These attitudes and prejudices can appear mild and of little harm, but often serve as the unwitting breeding ground for more serious forms of Anti-Semitism.

Lack of knowledge has the potential to be just as dangerous as purposeful and deliberate Anti-Semitism. Societies where ignorance of history and fact has been prevalent have fallen easy prey to more militant and deliberate actions, forces of government, and dark societal influence against Jews. For the sake of our students' knowledge it is very important to include the Jews and Israel in the curriculum and to treat their history, culture, and religion as an important part of the world.

The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement (BDS) is a virulent movement against the State of Israel and ultimately against the Jewish people. Terming BDS as a movement "for Palestine" is leading and highly discriminatory when presented with a singular slant and Palestinian specific language. BDS is among other controversial social movements recommended for study, but BDS is of particular concern. BDS stands out as a present and major contributor to the astronomical rise of anti-Semitic incidents and attitudes that we are seeing on US college campuses and beyond. Promoting the BDS movement as legitimate is likely to foster and encourage hateful attitudes and violence toward Jews and Israel at the high school level. This can, and already does, translate to a hostile environment for Jewish high school students.

Along with Linda Sarsour, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib arose from the anti-Semitic, un-American, Women's March.
Now, as Congresswomen, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are waging an unholy war in Congress to belittle the Holocaust, normalize anti-Semitism, and mainstream antiAmericanism. Among other controversial figures listed for study, these two Congresswomen have not been praiseworthy in their conduct or in their uneducated and provocative anti-Semitic statements. Their opinions require, at a minimum, refutation in the curriculum.

This portion of the curriculum refers to the formation of Israel, which came about chronologically soon after the Holocaust, with the term "Nakba". The text goes on to define "Nakba" as: "Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War". Using and promoting this terminology with regard to Israel is unacceptably one-sided and historically inaccurate. Other viewpoints are needed.

This is just one of many egregious examples of prejudiced and biased curriculum. In reality, Arab attacks in against Jews and against the British mandatory authority in the 1920s and continued without let up through the 1948 Israeli Declaration of Independence. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War began at the end of the British Mandate for Palestine when a military coalition of Arab states attacked the newly formed Jewish State on the morning of May 15 of that year.

PJTN believes that, in our generation, we live in a miraculous time with a restored nation of Israel. We believe that students would benefit from understanding the sacred importance God places on His Chosen people and their land of Israel.

It is impossible to cite every instance of concern in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. There is a troubling pattern of bias and presentation of inaccurate material throughout the document that becomes more profoundly obvious when reviewing the linked resources within it. There also is a one-sided social and political leaning to the draft Model Curriculum. Comments have been kept specific to the areas of greatest concern, passion, and knowledge.
PJTN unapologetically follows the Bible, and we dedicate ourselves to the protection of our Jewish neighbors, friends, and the nation of Israel. Anti-Semitism and acts of violence and hate towards the Jews and Israel is not new. These attitudes and their corresponding behaviors do not originate with one religion or people group. AntiSemitism comes from many sources and manifests in many forms. It sadly happens that, as we have witnessed in the Middle East, in the US, and around the world, much of the ideological and physical war calling for extermination of the Jewish people and Israel is coming from a faction within Islam. Given this heartbreaking reality, Ethnic Studies cannot ignore the Jews, and it cannot with legitimacy teach only the Arab and Muslim side of complex issues.

PJTN is heartened that the State Board of Education on August 12, 2019 issued its Joint Statement on the Draft of the Ethical Studies Curriculum. We are grateful for the SBOE's acknowledgement that the curriculum falls short, and we agree that there must be substantial redesign. We are of the opinion that the proposed Draft is so riddled with inaccurate and biased information, and more so when the links are included in the analysis, that a "clean slate" is required. PJTN urges the SBOE to start over.

It is our hope that a fresh curriculum will be written that will challenge California's youth with truth and allow students to learn about and understand complicated ethnic issues, without ideological indoctrination.
