To whom it may concern. I find the document appallingly bias and blatantly anti-Semitic. As a Jew, I find it frightening that the template would be proposed as part of a public or even private curriculum. Aren't Jews entitled to a voice, a perspective. Why is there no Jewish/Israeli point of view???? Respectfully, Marsha Janger
