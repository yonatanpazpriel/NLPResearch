This is a great step forward to empowering individuals that have been marginalized by the educational system. However, I want to emphasis that it will be important to make sure that schools are able to deliver the task to teachers that are competent in the subject. In other words, it will be important that those that are teaching ethnic studies to students are obviously certified to teach but, most importantly, that they are passionate about the subject. In practice, it will be crucial for ethnic studies to be taught by competent individuals because they will be the ones in the classrooms teaching the students.
