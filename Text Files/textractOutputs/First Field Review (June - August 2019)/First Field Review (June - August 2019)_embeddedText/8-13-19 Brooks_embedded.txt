The draft curriculum omits any discussion of antisemitism and the discrimination and hate directed at Jewish Americans in the past and present, exemplified in the recent surge of violent antisemitic incidents.
The draft curriculum discusses the displacement of Palestinians without providing the context and facts associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It refers to "the Nakba" but never mentions the Holocaust or the need for a Jewish state, nor does it discuss the violence preceding the Israeli War of Independence, which continues to this day. The draft curriculum condemns Israel and justifies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement which, as you of course know, is widely perceived by the Jewish community as discrimination against Jews and Israelis. Instead, it likens the BDS movement to a civil rights movement.
