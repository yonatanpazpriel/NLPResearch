Stop this madness. You're the ones full of hate and only wish discriminate against one type of human, the straight, white, Christian male. Stop infringing on the right of a parent to raise their child as you see fit. Don't push anti science gender nonsense onto my children. Facts are facts. Hopefully as my children get older, they won't be raised in this shit hole.
I'm sure by now you are laughing at this and smiling smugly as you know this will pass with flying colors. We normal humans who love our society will be punished once again. I just wanted to say something so that at the end of the day, I can say I did.
