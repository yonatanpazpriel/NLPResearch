While being a totally worthwhile enterprise, the fundamental question is what is the purpose and goal of an ethnic studies class. I think there are many very good reasons to include an ethnic studies course in a school curriculum, but in my view, those reasons do not include:
1. Political indoctrination
2. Teaching bias (implicitly or explicitly) against certain groups
3. One sided versions of history/issues/race relation etc. etc.
4. Singling out one country (Israel) for criticism and promoting a social/political movement (BDS) against that country especially knowing that this is highly controversial, considered antiSemitic by many and has led to real discrimination against Jews, including Jewish students
From what I have read, the proposed course as designed does all of the above. There is clearly a POV that is being pushed rather than a balanced evaluation of issues/history. Social studies courses that many of us grew up with had significant biases built into them and didn't offer a well-rounded view of the contributions by various ethnic groups nor of the significant challenges faced by many. That has rightly engendered criticism, but that error is not righted by designing a new extremely biased curriculum that espouses the political world view of the authors of the course and is apparently very unbalanced, anti-Semitic, anti-capitalist and "politically correct" to a fault.
Thank you for considering my comments. Karen Bisno
