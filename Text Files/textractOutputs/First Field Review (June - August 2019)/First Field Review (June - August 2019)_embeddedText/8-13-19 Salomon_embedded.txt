From: Galit Salomon Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies - Jewish/Israeli point of view
Hello Ethnic studies team,
My name is Galit, and I'm a worried parent, citizen and resident of CA for the past 9 years. I relocated to CA from Israel with my 3.5 twin boys. This week they will start their second year of middle school.
I read The new Ethnic Studies curriculum that is being proposed (and is up for vote on August 15th) and I found it disturbing, discriminating, and even anti-Semitic language.
I feel that you need to ensure that our students receive a curriculum that is grounded in accurate historical facts, uses neutral language, is conducive to open, respectful discussions, and promotes the American values of tolerance and inclusion. We must keep our schools safe and not promote hate and discrimination.
Sincerely, Galit Salomon
