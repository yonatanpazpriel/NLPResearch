From: Maris Schwartz Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 5:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Proposal
Hello,
My name is Maris Schwartz, and I am a mother of two boys, one of whom is an incoming freshman at Los Gatos High School.
I am absolutely disgusted and shocked the California Dept. of Education is considering a proposal to include the Boycott, Divest and Sanction (BDS) campaign against Israel as part of its curriculum. The BDS movement is driven by hate, lies and and a bloodthirsty mission to wipe out Jews. Your support of BDS is equivalent to backing The Klu Klux Klan. Just today the BDS boasted on Twitter about working with PFLP, which has been designated a terrorist group by the EU, US, Canada, and Israel. How can you, as educators, even consider this group when they regularly proclaim, "Palestine -- From the River to the Sea" -- i.e., the elimination of Israel?!
As a parent and tax-paying Californian, I strongly believe this proposal is poisonous and must be dropped.
