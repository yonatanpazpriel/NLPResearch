This curriculum unfairly depicts Israel as the enemy, only focusing on the Arabs. It totally discounts the American Jew experience and doesn't mention anti-semitism, only reinforcing this thought pattern by solely focusing on Palestine. By taking this stance, this curriculum institutionalizes the teaching of anti-Jewish stereotypes which is the opposite effect of the desired outcome
