From: Sandra Sachs Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 10:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony; JIAC Subject: Concern about Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum non-inclusion of Jewish experience
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I have recently found out and am deeply concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). While I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I implore you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from many groups including the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena and Amcha.
As a crime fighter in a significantly populous California community, I investigate crimes against all victims irrespective of race, ethnicity, creed, orientation, religious affiliation etc. I find it irresponsible that although a great deal of the ESM curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims (refer to the most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents). Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. I pride myself that investigation of crime from my laboratory is category-blind, but am personally hurt that the ESM curriculum would sanitize the facts regarding persistent crime still perpetrated against Jews.
For this significant omission alone, I respectfully request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address, at a minimum, this concern; correcting other omissions of the American Jewish experience from the ESMC would be equally welcome.
Thank you, Sandra Sachs
