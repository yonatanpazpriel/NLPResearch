From: Miriam Iosupovici Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 2:31 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: COMMENT ON GUIDELINES Importance: High
As a Jew, I am deeply offended by the proposed curriculum. As a citizen, someone knowledgeable about Jewish history in the United States, Israel, antisemitism and facts vs opinion, what I have read as proposed distresses me deeply and should NEVER become part of an authorized course of study. A dangerous political agenda has been inserted and should be removed. As an adult "child" of Holocaust survivors and refugees, I am horrified.
With antisemitism rising and ignorance about Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this Ethnic Studies curriculum and the insertion of a distorted, UNTRUE narrative is more than deeply disappointing, it is alarming.
