From: Michael Fried Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 12:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concern Regarding ESMC (Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum)
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
In my own experience as a United States citizen, a resident of California, and a parent, any curriculum that erroneously characterizes a race or group of people has the unfortunate power to fan the flames of hate. We have already witnessed how hate has affected the Jewish people in Poway, and we need our schools to teach unity. In order to do this, we must work harder to foster understanding, and truly do our homework as educators.
For example, The over-emphasis of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the definition of the Boycott,
Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) in the ESMC are both framed entirely from the vantage of proponents of BDS and fail to adhere to curriculum guidelines that require content to be taught in a manner that is "balanced", "inclusive", and reflective of "different perspectives". While Jews are an indigenous ethnic group to modern day Israel, and a significant minority in America, our voices are omitted in all curricular references to the Israeli Palestinian conflict.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Michael Fried, Foster City, CA Registered voter, taxpayer, concerned parent
