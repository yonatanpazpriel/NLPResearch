From: Karen Norton Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
I am not Jewish. However, my concerns about the proposed ethic studies curriculum are the same as those outlined in the letter from the ADL. I strongly believe the Jewish experience should be included in any mandated or suggested ethnic studies curriculum in the State of California.
Sincerely,
Karen Norton
