No where in the definition is there anything stated that relates to gender. The changes appear to create an issue that does not exist. Spelling alternatives must be used only in terms of electives where parents and students have an opt out choice. Homophobia is related to sexual preference and is not related to Ethnic Studies. Gender Identity is related to sexual identity and not related to Ethnic Studies. Both of these subjects can be studied in a sexuality course that is an elective. Parents and students should have the option to opt out. This document appears to have a clear political agenda. At Colleges and Universities, Ethnic Studies are electives and should remain this way for tax payer funded public schools.
