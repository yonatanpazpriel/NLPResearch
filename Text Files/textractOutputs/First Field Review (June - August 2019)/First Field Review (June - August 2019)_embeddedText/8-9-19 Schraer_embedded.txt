From: Sharon Schraer Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 4:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed new ethnic studies course
The proposed ethnic studies course is totally biased against Jews and the democratic state of Israel. It ignores Jews as a religious and ethnic group and uses blatant Palestinian biased views on Israel. Israel has a right to exist and basically made a democracy on their native homeland, way before Palestinians ever came up with that name. The Palestinians originally referred to the Jewish natives and became usurped by the currently called Palestinians.
This course ignores these rights of Israel as a free, democratic country and glorifies those terrorists and others out to erase it.
Ethnic studies should be based on truth and reality, not on views of one side, based on hatred and destruction.
