I was a supporter of the Ethnic Studies Model curriculum, however, as a supporter I was shocked by the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum's (ESMC) manifest indifference, and even hostility, to the American Jewish experience and community. The curriculum erases American Jewish history by failing to include Jews in a meaningful way, and it neglects any discussion of antiSemitism. Further, it incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes in its completely inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American ethnic groups. I oppose the inclusion of problematic material, such as the one-sided criticism of Israel, along with the exclusion of any discussion of the contributions of Jewish Californians to the state and any discussion of anti-Semitism. The curriculum uses blatantly anit-Semitictrope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.

Please only adopt an ethnic studies curriculum that is accurate, free of bias, appropriate for all learners in our diverse state, and align with Governor Newsom's vision of a California for all.
