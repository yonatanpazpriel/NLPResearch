From: The Tubo's Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comment on Ethnic Studies
I am writing in support of the ethnic studies curriculum. My child took a pilot version of it last year as a 9th grader at West Campus in Sacramento. It was a good complement to the study of the Holocaust in his 8th grade English and social studies classes. He did not report the entire class content to us but he did share with us what he learned about colonialism and red-lining.
Respectfully, Alison French-Tubo
