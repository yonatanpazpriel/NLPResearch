Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I grew up with ethnic studies and totally support education that promotes understanding of the diverse cultures we in California are so lucky to live among. We need to get beyond stereotypes.
I am appalled by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, which does the opposite in its treatment of Jews and Israel. How can a 22-page glossary and bibliography have entries for Islamophobia and racism, but none for anti-Semitism? Why is the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, known in Israel as the War of Independence, referred to as the "1948 Palestine War," and the creation of Israel is referred to as the "Nakba," Arabic for "catastrophe"? Why are Jews of color, refugees from North Africa and the Middle East, not mentioned?
Far from promoting understanding, these aspects of the proposed curriculum reinforce stereotypes and fan the flames of hatred. You may be aware that a man was arrested recently in Contra Costa County who planned to emulate mass shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh and San Diego.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Sheila Himmel
