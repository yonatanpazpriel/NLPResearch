From: Matt Fisch Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:43 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concern Regarding Bill
To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to express my utter disgust and disappointment at the radically anti-semitic curriculum being proposed in this state. As a Jewish American, I face constant anti-semitism. I assure you that Jews in America do not need young people to grow up being taught ignorant and naive views that lead them to an anti-semitic point of view. Furthermore, this curriculum espouses ignorance in favor of the truth, and makes no effort to highlight the anti-semitism that Jews face in California on a constant basis.
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Anybody involved with drafting up this curriculum is a raging antisemite. You all condemn racism--but it is you who are the racists.
Sincerely,
Matthew Fisch
