Please eliminate your anit-Jewish bias from the school curriculum. Having ethnic classes as a requirement is demeaning, rude and totally unnecessary! What a horrible idea. Students will learn about ethnics outside of class and as they grow older. ELIMINATE YOUR ANTI ISRAEL BIAS NOW! Shame, shame, shame on you for even thinking about it.
Sincerely, Rhonda Larson
