It is in correct and inappropriate, in my opinion, claim in the definition of
the BDS movement that it is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" in Israel. Objective reading of the BDS websites and information show it is aimed at the delegitimization of Israel. Palestinians have more freedom in Israel than Palestinians living in any other neighboring country. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
