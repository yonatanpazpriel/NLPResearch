The power hungry democrats are undermining this country and what it stands for. Capitalism is the best proven system in the world. If you politicians don't like capitalism and America GTFO!!! Nobody is making you stay here. You can leave anytime you want. You have no right to shove your progressive agenda down our children's throats. All so you can corrupt our kids and the so the Democrats can stay in power. Democrats have destroyed this state and made it a third world country. California is now a s-hole along with all other Democrat run cities because of your progressive policy that destroy neighborhoods.
