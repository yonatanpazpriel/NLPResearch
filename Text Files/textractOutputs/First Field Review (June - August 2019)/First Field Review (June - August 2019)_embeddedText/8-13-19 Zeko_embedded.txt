Very concerned that entire document and curriculum will only further widen racial and cultural divide in America. Promotes differences and focuses upon identities as opposed to universal human condition. Values what can't be controlled over what can be. Lines 162-163: Suggests that all white students need "help" to become advocates for equity? Lines 518-522: Insulting notion that white teachers need to "work through assignments...to begin the process of constructively situating oneself in relationship to Ethnic Studies." Lines 306-309: Just terrible imposition of one viewpoint. Does nothing to help our students with critical thinking. I'd fail my journalism students for statements like this.
