� The ESMC Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience: Despite the significant contributions that Jews have made to California history, politics, culture and government � and the Jewish community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � Jews are essentially omitted as an ethnic group in the ESMC.
� The ESMC Omits Anti-Semitism: While the ESMC specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of anti-Semitism. The ESMC Glossary includes the terms Racism, Sexism, Anthropocentrism, Cisheteropatriarchy, Heteropatriarchy, Classism, Colonialism, Homophobia, Imperialism, Islamophobia, Patriarchy, Transphobia, White Supremacy, and Xenophobia. It does not include the term Anti-Semitism.
� The ESMC Denigrates Jews: In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture" � a classic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews control the media.
� The ESMC Singles Out Israel for Condemnation: The ESMC promotes the anti-Semitic, anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and singles out Israel � the only Jewish state in the world � for special criticism and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate.

That's no surprise: Three of the 18 members on the advisory committee which developed the ESMC have documented records of anti-Israel bias and support for anti-Israel boycotts.

As the Jewish Caucus stated in its letter objecting to the ESMC: "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were to instead marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community. Without significant edits, the ESMC will do just that."
