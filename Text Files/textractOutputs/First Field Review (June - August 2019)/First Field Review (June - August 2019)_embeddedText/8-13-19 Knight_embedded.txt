From: Akemi Kayleng Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethnic studies curriculum
To whom it may concern: First, let me make it clear that by all conventional definitions of what it means to be from an "oppressed minority" background, I am very much that kind of person. Second, I cannot state strongly enough how concerned I am about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. It is riddled with flaws and unless drastically rewritten it will hurt all Californians, including people like me. There are MANY different "diversity experiences," and minorities vary greatly among themselves. Minority people position themselves all across the political spectrum, from very conservative to very liberal. There is no single "minority experience." While I am generally on the liberal/progressive side of things, I find the proposed curriculum disturbingly biased towards extreme far leftism. I certainly do not feel that capitalism is an expression of white racist oppression. I am bothered that people like me will supposedly be served by this curriculum. We are now over 50 years past the march on Washington, and much has changed since then. Racism and bigotry are still with us. But so are greatly improved race relations. The curriculum must be rewritten to reflect the reality of today, not the reality of a bygone era. Akemi Knight Los Angeles, California
