From: dmjberkey Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Complaint of Ethics Curriculum Under Consideration- Public Comment by August 15th
I oppose wholeheartedly this type of ethics' curriculum and know my constitutional rights are being violated. We do not need propanganda being taught to our children. You are here to represent us all.
As a grandparent and a former educator and School Administrator oppose these type of changes, which truly is crazy and extremely radical.
School Board Elections are always another opportunity to elect officers that represent parents and family members as a whole and individually. You are our voice and by moving forward with this curriculum major change is an outrage and will not be tolerated.
Please take the proper action to reverse this type of radical representation. What happened to our democracy?
Your immediate consideration is desired.
Thank you for your service to represent us all.
Very Concerned Grandparent,
Maria Berkey
Joyfully Serving, Maria J. Berkey,
