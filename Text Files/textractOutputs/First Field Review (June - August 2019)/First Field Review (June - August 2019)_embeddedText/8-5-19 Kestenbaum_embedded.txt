Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Examples include:
- Page 2 of the Glossary includes a definition of BDS Movement, which offers pro-BDS talking points and does not offer any critical perspectives about this campaign, which many believe to be a hateful and anti-Semitic campaign that seeks to end Israel's existence
- The Sample Lesson Plans � p. 234 encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS Group called Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. This page also promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people and the US policies on the border with Mexico.
- Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country.
- Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspetices.
- Page 256 and Page 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders.

- There is no lesson at all in the proposed curriculum that features the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism on the rise, the exlusion of American Jews in a curriculum on Ethnic Studies is disappointing.
- I urge you to please add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

I am a parent of 4 school-age children in the state of California. It would be very upsetting to my children if this curriculum failed to include their ethnic group in an Ethnic Studies curriciulum, especially as they are aware that their grandfather was a Holocaust survivor and several of his family members perished in the Holocaust, and there are instances when our family has suffered from antisemitisim in this country (and in this state).
