Page 1, footnote 1 Alternate spellings have no advantage shown in any scientific research. Relying on Ethnic/Gender studies research is inappropriate for conducting public policy. Please stick to reality for taxpayer funded projects. Page 1, line 20 � Page 21, line 530 Again, results from Ethnic studies departments should only be used when supported by actual scientific research. General For a topic of such extreme importance � teaching the diversity in our society and the need to understand and work with those around us � this atrocious course sample is detached from any academic standards, devoid of merit, and has no business being used in any classroom. If this is typical of the quality of work from the members of the panel creating it, they should be removed from all future work for the state. Page 2, line 29 � line 40 Using Ethnic Studies department material as opposed to actual studies of ethnicity by actual science is misleading, unsupported by actual research, and damaging to young students. Information introduced in school should be supported by reality and not the fantasies of fringe Humanities departments. Page 3, lines 61 � 77 These terms, as commonly used in Ethnic/Gender Studies journals have no academic merit and are not backed by any reliable social science research.

Page 4, line 87 Including dissimilar topics such as "white supremacy" which is a real and documented social group, "capitalism" an economic system, and "patriarchy" � presumably the Ethnic Studies cartoon of social structures instead of an actual patriarchy � is academically dishonest and has no business being included in a school setting. The rest Similar criticisms. Such an extremely important topic being handed over to the academic frauds that stole the name "Ethnic Studies" is a disservice to our children. In junior high and high school, I took part in a number of groups and programs that studies and taught the dimensions of our racial and gender differences here in Southern California. It was a point of pride for me that I had been a (small) part of the connections that would help create a bond throughout our society. These documents break my heart. All I see is the lost opportunity of taking the next step in fixing our society. The creators of this joke of a Curriculum have no business planning for our schools.

This is a betrayal of our children. I can only hope if this trash gets approved the teachers of my children's school will have enough sense to offer some value along side it.
