[Appendices page 7 Unit 2, Line 240: Immigration, Migration, and Movement- Suggestion to include Korean American Immigration History: Since their immigration to United States in 1903, Korean Americans have become a thriving part of the nation's progress and prosperity, serving as a significant mediator for the strong economic, political, and cultural alliance between United States and Korea. With the recognition of proud Korean Heritage Korean Americans, such as US Army officer Young Oak Kim, Olympic gold medalist Sammy Lee, and the contributions that Korean American community has made in California and United States, the 109th Congress of the United States of America passed a resolution on December 2005, commemorating January 13th as the "Korean American Day". Today, after more than 100 years since the arrival of the Korean pioneer immigrants, Korean Americans comprise the largest population of the East Asian ethnic group and the strongest community in California, with the thriving culture in the heart of Los Angeles, known as Koreatown.]
