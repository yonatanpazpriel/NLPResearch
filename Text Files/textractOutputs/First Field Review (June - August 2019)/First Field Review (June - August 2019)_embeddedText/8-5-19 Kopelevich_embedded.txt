Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] Pages 2,234,256,264-269 � too many lines. As a 82 years old Jew, who personally experienced the antisemitism in the Soviet Union, I state, that those, who inspired the BDS movement, or those who compare Israel to the former South Africa are bigots, racist and anti-semites. The Arabs, who live inside Israel, enjoy full rights as Israeli citizens; Arabs, who live in the territories controlled by Israel, free to elect their own administration.
