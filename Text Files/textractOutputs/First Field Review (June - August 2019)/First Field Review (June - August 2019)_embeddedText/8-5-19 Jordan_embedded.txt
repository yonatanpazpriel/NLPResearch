From: Kathy Jordan Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 9:33 AM To: Superintendent Subject: CDE - Public comment Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the State Superintendent of Education:
I write to vigorously object to the CDE proposal to incorporate an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum into our California public schools.
Our CA public schools have many challenges simply educating our children to achieve academic proficiency in basic subjects, and I would like to see the CDE focus on that goal, rather than on a program that distracts and detracts from that focus. Given our students do not all achieve basic academic proficiency, which hinders their potential in life, please place all of the CDE's focus, energy, and it's direction to its public schools on working towards that goal.
Thank you.
Best,
Kathy Jordan
