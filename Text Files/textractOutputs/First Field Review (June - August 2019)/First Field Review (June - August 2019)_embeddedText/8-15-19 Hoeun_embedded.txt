to say this makes today's USA the most diverse country in the world. After reading this 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft, I felt that my ethnicity, Korean, was underrepresented even though we make up a significant portion of California's diverse demographics.
Japan is like Germany, which has not apologized to the Jews. Imagine, what if Germany hid its own historical wrongs and taught its students a false history? It's unbelievably awful. Even though Japan is a war criminal country, it has packaged itself as a victim of war to educate its descendants about history. Japan faked history and still does not apologize to war-ravaged countries, including South Korea. This fact can be found with a little study of East Asian history and I feel frustrated with the attempt by the advanced U.S. to teach false history.
