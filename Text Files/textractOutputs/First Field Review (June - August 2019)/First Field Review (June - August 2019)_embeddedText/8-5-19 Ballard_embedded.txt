From: Joseph Ballard Sent: Saturday, August 3, 2019 2:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment on California Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello, As a resident of California, I am disgusted that this curriculum has been proposed. Stating that capitalism is a form of power and oppression, the patriarchy, racism, white supremacy, or anything of the sort shows insane bias and is left wing propaganda at best. As a California resident, I am disgusted that money was spent developing this curriculum and furthermore as a current graduate student studying economics and disappointed in regards to the incredible lack of situation economic knowledge relating to the history and practice of capitalism.
