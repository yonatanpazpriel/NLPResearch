The Curriculum is politically motivated. It has a radically leftist agenda, and is not a reasonably balanced educational tool. It should be entirely rejected. The Curriculum promotes BDS against Israel, which is an anti-Semitic movement and has been condemned by the U.S. Congress If there is treatment of Islamophobia and Arab-Americans, why isn't there similar treatment of anti-Semitism and Jewish-Americans? The definition of capitalism is skewed and based on radical socialism.

"

The definition of `whiteness' is discriminatory and serves to increase divisiveness

in our country, rather than bringing people together.
