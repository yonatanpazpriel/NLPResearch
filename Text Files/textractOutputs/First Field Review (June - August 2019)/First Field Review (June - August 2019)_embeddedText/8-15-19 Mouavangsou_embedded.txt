Page 41, line 789 � I want to thank the writers of this model curriculum for including the various Southeast Asian ethnic groups affected by the Viet Nam War. However, since we do live in California it also important to mention Iu-Mien as well.

I fully support the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, especially with the core courses (Arab American studies, African American studies, Asian American Pacific islander studies, Native American Studies, and Chican@ studies). The absence of these courses reinforced what is valuable and not, in our K-12 education. These courses are essential for everyone (including those who identifies and do not identity with the listed racial categories) in order to have a comprehensive knowledge of our U.S. history and better serve our diverse communities. Only through learning about one another can we and our future generations be able to work together.
