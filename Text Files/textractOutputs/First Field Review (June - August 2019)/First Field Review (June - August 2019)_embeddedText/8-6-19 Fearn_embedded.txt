Page 1 I support the inclusion of Arab American Studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California public schools. Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. At this time of rising nativism our schools need to be including everyone in the stories we tell about our nation and community. Page 233 I support the objectives which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenophobia and discrimination and to create a wqelcoming environment for marginalized students. Page 236 Including a history of migration is necessary for any marginalized community. It helps to create a bridge between communities and celebrates a rich history of a growing population. While some of the facts that have driven people to migrate are unpleasant, telling the story honestly empowers and informs individuals and communities.
