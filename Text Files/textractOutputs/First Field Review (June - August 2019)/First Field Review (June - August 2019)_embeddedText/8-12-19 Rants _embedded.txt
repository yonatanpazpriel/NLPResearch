I dont want you guys teaching propaganda to my kids, I Will SUE, leave my kids alone from this PRO leftist ideas, I'm Hispanic and I dont want you teaching anti capitalism, pro queer stuff; my kids dont even watch TV with violence or anything in that nature, they dont watch pro sexuality. Please do not change curriculum. Leave my kids alone, do what you get paid to do and teach, not indoctrinate. I am "ethnic" if you care you will stop this. Little kids should not be subjected to nonsense like this.
