The draft curriculum fails to include antisemitism as a domain of Ethnic Studies in American history. Jews are an ethnic and religious minority in the United States whose experience and persecution is completed excluded from the proposed curriculum. P. 234, l. 4956-4957 lists organizations that seek to delegitimize the state of Israel without providing context or opposing views.

P. 2, l. 30-40 describes the BDS movement without the additional context that the movement has been criticized of antisemitic rhetoric and has been denounced with bipartisan support in the U.S. House of Representatives as seeking to delegitimize the state of Israel. No inclusion of antisemitism despite inclusion of other prejudices like islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia
