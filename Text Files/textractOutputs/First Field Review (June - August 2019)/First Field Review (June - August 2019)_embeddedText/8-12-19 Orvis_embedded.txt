Dear California Legislators and Educators,
Please teach the next generation to love all of the nations of the world. Please teach our children the truth about all peoples including the one Jewish nation in the Middle East. Leave out all bias and just teach everyone the facts. It is a fact that the Jewish people have lived continuously in the land of Israel and Judea and Samaria for at least four thousand years. Israel came into being long before being officially recognize at the United Nations(UN) in 1948. Many documents precede this fact like the Balfour Declaration and the 1918 and 1922 declarations at the predecessor to the UN. When Israel was a very young nation the Arabs nations surrounding her thought they could win several wars against the new nation so they started those wars. They did not win and Israel has been defending her sovereignty ever since. No nation is perfect, but distorting or erasing history is not the answer. Israel has a right to exist and to defend the people living there, including Arabs. The Jewish people as a whole have had a lot of influence throughout history as well, especially in America which is founded on Judeo-Christian principles. This recognition can be found everywhere, but a look at the Nobel prize winners will give students a great example. There is no need for the education system in California to promote any religion, region, nation, people groups over another. Stop the hate and teach cultural comparisons and differences through history; not political biases. Sincerely, Paula Orvis
