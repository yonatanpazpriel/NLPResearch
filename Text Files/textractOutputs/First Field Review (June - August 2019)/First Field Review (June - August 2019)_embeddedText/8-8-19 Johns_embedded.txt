From: Michael Johns Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft for Ethnic Studies
I urge you to reconsider the wording of the proposed curriculum. I believe that there should be a balancing and guidance for teachers so that they can include the positive aspects of and opposite view points of each issue. Such as "capitalism" which has been the most successful economic approach in history. Additionally I believe that singling out "white" supremacy is bias and that just "supremacy would suffice then a discussion, in the classroom, could cover all supremacy and therefore deal with supremacy itself which would include "white" and any other form. Sincerely, Michael L. Johns Redlands, CA
