From: Suzan Barazani Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: What about the Holocaust and anti semitism?
Hello,
I'm ok with including ethnic studies in students' curriculum.
But please make sure that all ethnicities are represented accurately. As a daughter of two Holocaust survivors, it is extremely important that the Holocaust is covered, as well as anti semitism throughout history.
Sincerely, Dr. Suzan Barazani
