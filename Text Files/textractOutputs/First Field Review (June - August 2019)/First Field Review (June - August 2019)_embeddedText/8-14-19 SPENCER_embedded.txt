To start off, my concerns are based on my reading of this proposed curriculum. I believe it is not free of bias, and in fact, this curriculum has a distinct leftistprogressive bias including (among other things) the endorsement of BDS and the treatment of capitalism as a form of power and oppression. White supremacy is represented in the curriculum but don't other `races' in our country also have the same prejudicial feelings that "they" are superior? (This is omitted.) The curriculum fails to mention the Jews/Israelis in the section(s) dealing with discrimination--antisemitism persists and is at an all-time high, certainly the curriculum skips this realism. Why? In addition, the mis-labeling of the country Israel as ISRAEL-PALESTINE rather than the correct country's name, "ISRAEL" is not just inaccurate, but it further shows the left-progressive bias of the curriculum.

I find the curriculum overall promotes groupthink with one side only being presented rather than all sides; it is better to provide an avenue for open-minded and fair discussion. Shouldn't we leave politics and bias out of it? Or in the least facilitate understanding and challenge students to expand their perspectives thoughtfully and to be respectful of others with a difference of opinion?

Lastly, and more importantly, when California K-12 schools perform so poorly (41st in the nation, below a C- grade - Nat'l Assess. of Ed. Prog.) educators and administrators need to be addressing this tragedy before anything else. Year after year, it is the same thing--meaningful action needs to be taken to address the education issues we have in our California public schools. To quote a friend with children, "This is another reason we aren't sending our kids to government schools."
