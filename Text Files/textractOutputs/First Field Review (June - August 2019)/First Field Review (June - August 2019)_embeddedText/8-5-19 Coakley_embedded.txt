As a legal resident of CA I strongly disapprove of the implementation of the above curriculum. Do legislatures have the right to require this in our public schools? As a retired CA credentialed teacher, I strongly feel this oversteps the boundaries of public school curriculum. CA should be embarrassed to be spending tax payer dollars on such a program, especially when we rank LOWEST in the nation in student performance. Spend time and money on student mastery of the standards in place! This political agenda is inappropriate in public education. It's time for our legislators to pass a School of choice law!
