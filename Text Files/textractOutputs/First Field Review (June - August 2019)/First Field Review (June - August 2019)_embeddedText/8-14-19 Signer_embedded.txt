This proposed curriculum shows, at best an indifference, and at worst, hostility toward the American Jewish experience and community. The curriculum fails and is innapropriate in three ways:
1) It erases American Jewish history by failing to include Jews in a meaningful way. How one can teach about California's history, without talking about the contributions of Jewish-Americans is beyond me. Take for example, California's most famous and beloved industry, entertainment. This industry that employs huge numbers of Californians was built my Jewish entrepreneurs.
2) It neglects any discussion of anti-Semitism, especially at a time when half of all hate crimes in this country are directed at Jews, despite Jews making up only 1.4% of the country's population. And let's be clear, Judaism is not merely a religion, but an ethnic group (identifiable as distinct from white Europeans in DNA testing). With the rise of white nationalism and hate in this country, ignoring their most common target is unconscionable.
3) Not only does the curriculum ignore Jews, it actually will serve to promote hate against them. It incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes in its completely inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American ethnic groups. The singling out of criticism of Israel has been clearly established to be veiled hate by experts, including many of this countries antidiscrimination organizations and non-profits. BDS is a dog whistle used to drum up hate against Jews, including Jewish Americans, despite having nothing to do with the supposed complaints. It is no different than internment camps for Japanese Americans as punishment for the actions of a foreign country's government during World War 2 or blaming all Muslims for 9/11.
