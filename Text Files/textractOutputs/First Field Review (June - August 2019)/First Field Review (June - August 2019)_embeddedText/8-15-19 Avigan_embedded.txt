From: Alisa Avigan Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Please Revise Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
Although I support the introduction of an Ethnics Studies course to educate students on race, ethnicity and indigeneity in the United States, I am upset by the unbalanced curriculum being proposed. As a California resident, I urge you to make major revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter and Jimena.
I believe the proposed curriculum is flawed in two major ways:
� The topic of the Palestinian/Israeli international conflict is out-of-context for a course whose objective is to focus on the national struggles of ethnic groups within the United States. Singling out this international conflict for inclusion within a domestic studies course is not only perplexing, but encourages surface, one-sided discussion of a complex issue that requires a dedicated course.
� Omitting the topic of anti-semitism from the curriculum is a major oversight. Anti-semitism is currently rising in the United States, evidenced by recent shootings at synagogues in California and Pennsylvania, anti-semitic chants heard in Charlottesville and hate crimes against Jews accounting for more than half of the religiously-motivated hate crimes in 2018 according to FBI stats.
As a Jewish, Californian resident, I believe that the proposed curriculum will further fuel the hate and discrimination currently being encountered by my community, a community, which needs the support of the state more than ever.
Please take this letter into consideration.
Sincerely,
Alisa Avigan
