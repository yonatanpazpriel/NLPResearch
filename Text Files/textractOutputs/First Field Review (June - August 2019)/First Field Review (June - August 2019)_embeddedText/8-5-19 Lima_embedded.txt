After having reviewed the whole curriculum I find it to be very biases and one sided. It feels and seems more like you are indocturnating students to a specific ideology. I do not find it fair and balanced. Everyone who is not white is a victum of the "evil white man'. Captalism is not a bad thing. I don't see where the advances, freedom and opportunites of this system are presented. Or a comparision with other economic sysytem and the results of those. I strongly urge you not to approve curriculum.
