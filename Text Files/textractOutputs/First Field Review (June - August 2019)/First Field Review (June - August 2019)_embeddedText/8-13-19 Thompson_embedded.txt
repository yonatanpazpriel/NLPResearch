-----Original Message----From: Lois Thompson Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 9:19 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed new ethnic studies curriculum
I write to you as a supporter of ethnic studies. Nonetheless I am deeply concerned about the overall proposed curriculum and particularly its antiJewish bias as well as its anti-capitalism. In brief, I have reviewed the curriculum and agree with the Los Angeles Times that it feels more like an "exercise in groupthink, designed to proselytize and inculcate" than a curriculum intended to foster spirited inquiry, genuine debate, and actual critical thinking.
The merits and demerits of capitalism are many and varied and capitalism includes the corner bodega as well as Apple. The curriculum unfortunately does not begin to recognize this nor does it include the economic and historical data and analysis that must inform any real discussion of this topic.
The anti-Jewish bias of the proposed curriculum is particularly troubling as is the related embrace of the BDS movement. From my perspective, for that reason alone, it must be rejected and rewritten. I fully support and agree with the sentiments expressed in the letter sent to you by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and strongly recommend that you heed what these legislators are saying. Particularly in these fraught times with anti-Semitism on the rise, there is no place in California (or anywhere) for the explicit and implicit anti-Jewish message of the proposed curriculum. I find it chilling and a reason for Jewish families to exit the public school system, plainly not the result you are seeking.
Please revise the curriculum.
Sincerely yours,
Lois Thompson Los Angeles, California
