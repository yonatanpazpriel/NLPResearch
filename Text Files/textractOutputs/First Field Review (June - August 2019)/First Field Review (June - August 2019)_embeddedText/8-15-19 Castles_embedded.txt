There are too many problems with this guideline to enumerate with this draft. This is reflected in the lack of diversity in the Advisory Committee membership. The members are either high school teachers or college professors. They work in a largely tenured bubble speaking the same jargon with essentially the same politics (far left) that is not reflective of the whole state. For an example, they are hostile to capitalism, yet free markets made this country the world's economic leader with one of the highest standards of living. Research shows that the standard of living world wide has increased in the last several decades. That is due to countries such as India and China (though still authoritarian) abandoning socialism for capitalism. It is true that capitalism leads to more inequality, but in the long run most people are better off.

Committee members also have a special interest in creating demand for teaching jobs for their graduates who would otherwise do not have a marketable skill.

The expression "white privilege" is insulting to many Californians. While there was certainly some unfair discrimination in the past by Europeans, particularly to Native Americans and African Americans there are strong arguments that this problem is disappearing and that differences in academic results can be traced to culture. After all Asian Americans are generally more successful in school and income levels than Caucasians because of their intact families and a strong academic emphasis. Such a discussion would not be included in the class because it does not follow the narrative of its proponents

While some will debate these points for political reasons, counterarguments should be included in Ethnic Studies which are currently taught with extreme bias in colleges and universities.

In conclusion the ethnic studies guidelines need to be completely rewritten with more diverse political inputs and the inflammatory oppression politics needs to be toned down. As written, it creates a hostile environment in school and unacceptably biased.
