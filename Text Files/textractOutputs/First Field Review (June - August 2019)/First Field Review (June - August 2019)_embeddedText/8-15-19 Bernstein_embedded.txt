From: Marcella Bernstein Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 3:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: unbalanced proposed new curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have three children who have gone through the CA public school system. I have not come across more unbalanced curriculum to date as compared to the proposed ethnic studies curriculum.
This curriculum does not mention antisemitism. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. I am concerned for the safety of my children who are now all on college campuses.
I strongly urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Dr. Marcella Bernstein
