I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction over the recent proposed changes to California's high school curriculum. It is unconscionable to me that you would teach about Islamophobia and other prejudices, but completely ignore anti-Semitism. Hate crimes against Jews have been rising at an alarming rate.
Additionally, it is unacceptable to teach only one side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is important to teach both sides of this issue in a fair and balanced way.
Lastly, the BDS movement is a one-sided effort to destroy the State of Israel economically, culturally, and politically. Israel is our strongest ally in the Middle East, and as such, should be supported.
I urge you to reconsider this curriculum. Thank you.
