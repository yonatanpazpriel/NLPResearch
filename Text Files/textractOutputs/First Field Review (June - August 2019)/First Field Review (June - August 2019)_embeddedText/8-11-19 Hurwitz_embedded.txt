From: dikla Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:40 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Request for revisions or a significant rewrite of ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am Dikla Carmel Hurwitz extremely concerned by the recommended unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a teacher at Stanford university, I know first-hand what might be the consequences of eliminating one point of view. I support diversity and inclusion, but pops a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experiences flaws to discuss antisemitism, reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews, and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-anti-semitic stereotypes in our public schools.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Best, Dikla Dikla Carmel Hurwitz CPCC, PCC
