The California Department of Education has proposed a controversial anti-Semitic new public high school Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The curriculum is anti-Israel in that it promotes BDS as a "freedom" movement, legitimizes the description of Israel as an "apartheid" state, and glorifies rabid anti-Israel public figures such as Linda Sardiur. The Ethnic Studies Curriculum also neglects to include Jews as an ethnic minority. We implore you to put a stop to this curriculum before it is adopted. Thank you. Dr. Paul & Harriet Saperstein
