Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable) I am respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Examples of bias are listed below:
The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. [Include the page and line number(s) here�
On page 2 of the glossary for the curriculum there is a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of this document. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:

� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
� Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
� Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
� Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
� Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

� I value inclusion and truth, however BDS promotes hate and division.

I am urging the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
