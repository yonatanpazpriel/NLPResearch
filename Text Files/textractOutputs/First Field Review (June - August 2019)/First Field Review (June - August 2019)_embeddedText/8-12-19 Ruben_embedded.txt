There is a grossly conspicuous omission: ANTI-SEMITISM
Jews are a minority in the USA (~1.5%) and in the world at large (0.20%). The basis of a liberal democratic society is not just the concept of pursuing the best interest of the majority, it is also about protecting those in the minority. While many perceive this minority (jews) as generally strong and successful and thus unworthy of, and not in need of protection, this notion is borne of ignorance as to the history and context of this group. The recent rise of a Jewish state has legitimized attacks on jews, while giving cover as a "legitimate criticism" of another nation's policies. So many `scholarly academics' and advocates of justice mistakenly adopt the narrative that being FOR someone means that you have to be AGAINST another. While it is convenient and clear to make one the oppressor and the other the oppressed, there is much more to it. Currently anti-semitism is growing around the "enlightened" world where it has waxed and waned for the last couple of millennia. Unfortunately, it is popping its ugly head in the USA on the far right with the white supremacists, and in the far left as well. We need to pay attention before we descend into tragedy that we

may not foresee, because we are so sure that this time it's different. That this time we got it right and history will not repeat itself. When addressing the sources of information and their intended audience it is essential to consider and discuss the personal interests and the real and potential biases they may have. Furthermore, when focusing on the audience one should consider which `group(s)' stand to benefit from the sources position, and it whose expense? Are there `innocent bystandards (groups) who may be hurt? When discussing leaders of their movements, what are the positive consequences of their movement? Were their negative consequences? What are they? Could they have been avoided? The call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel is an example of a movement that simplifies a complex issue by blaming and delegitimizing a nation that consists of minority group (jews) that make up a majority (~75%) of a sovereign, liberal democratic state who, like us in the USA is mandated to protect its minorities, but does not always work at it hard enough. Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico � implying that this is a legitimate comparison is inaccurate at best. Mexico & Palestine are not equivalent. Mexico is a democratic country with an institutional infrastructure that supports it. Palestine is not, And the implication that it is, is factually false (not the basis for productive education). A discussion of the Palestinian arabs, their history, leadership and why Palestine did not become a sovereign state at this stage would be much more relevant. What is it like to be a palestinian without having citizenship in a sovereign nation? And what can be done to remediate the past and present for a better future. Would there be a better chance by delegitimizing or waging war on your neighbor? Or to create an alliance that will make both better off?

Schools and campuses are becoming scary places for jewish americans. They are afraid to speak up lest they be called racist, oppressors, nazis, or worse. Discussing and learning the context of the issues may contribute to the development of empathy on both sides. Ignoring this trend in our educational institutions will condemn us all to the cycles of violence that engulfs seemingly enlightened societies who ignore the lessons of history. One last comment � Ethnic studies should not just be about feeling good and taking pride in who you are. It should also be about allowing, and even encouraging others who are different than you openly feel the same way about themselves.
