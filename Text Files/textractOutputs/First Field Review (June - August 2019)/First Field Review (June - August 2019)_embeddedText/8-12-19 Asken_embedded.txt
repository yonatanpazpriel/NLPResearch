From: Tamar Asken Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 12:17 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: public comment on ethnic studies curriculum model
I urge the committee to reconsider the content of the model curriculum of the ethnic studies course in light of it's shocking anti-jewish and anti-israel bias. Merely overlooking anti-semitism in this time of rampant attacks agains jewish institutions is problematic enough, but encouraging student divestment in Israel is pretty bewildering. Please add my voice to all the others who do not think this is the interpretation of Ethnic Studies we want taught to our kids. Sincerely, Tamar Asken
