Page 1 of 22 � While I understand that it is not practical to include every ethnicity in a high-school ethnic studies class, I do find it unreasonable that there is no mention of the Jewish American experience of anti-Semitism anywhere in your curriculum or your even your Glossary.

The sad history of Jewish exclusion from mainstream American public and private institutions in the first few centuries of American history is widely known. Jews are often singled out for specific denigration, along with African Americans.

The resurgence of anti-Semitism today, with its violent and deadly attacks targeting our community, is an indication of the persistent nature of the threat to our existence.

 According to the latest FBI Statistics, in 2017 58% were victims of crimes
motivated by their offenders' anti-Jewish bias.  By contrast Hate Crimes against Muslim Americans as described in the
curriculum as Islamophobia were fewer than 18% for the same period.  For as long as records have been kept by the FBI, ethnic hate crimes against
Jews have never fallen below the level 50% of all religiously/ethnically motivated hate crimes. There is no context provided in your curriculum to provide a balanced perspective of the facts supported by data.

It is rather strange that Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) gets prime place in the Glossary of a curriculum of United States Ethnic Studies. It is the only term in the glossary that refers to a specific non-US political agenda!!

BDS has no place in this curriculum or the Glossary.

As stated above regarding the BDS references, Direct Action Front for Palestine, Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel and comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico are not relevant topics for a US Ethnic Studies course.

As a proud Californian and an immigrant, I am saddened that our California school curriculum could become another platform to delegitimize Israel and add to the growing threat of anti-Semitism by association. Our schools should not be the place to promote a political agenda without context. There is no alternative perspective presented in any of the Arab-American narratives, and sadly this one-sided approach injects a natural bias to one side of a very complex issue.

Page 241 � Line 5131 to 5163 The Immigration Act of 1924 (line 5151) had far reaching implications for many more people than only the Arab populations. This section glosses over the exclusion of others including countless Jews who, as a direct result of the Johnson Reed Act, became victims of the extermination of Jews in Europe on a scale that is unimaginable in today's world. Discussing the creation of the state of Israel only from an Arab-American point of view is a selective recording of history and is a dangerous path to take for our High-School students.
