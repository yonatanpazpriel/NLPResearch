Pages 1,2� I was shocked and dismayed that there was no mention of Anti Semitism and that the BDS was at all presented and in a way that was incredibly biased and one-sided. We are doing our students a terrible injustice if we are not sharing two sides of a very complicated and complex issue and instead present a political agenda.
