Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157 � 61); and pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trop of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing the land.
As a taxpayer who sent 3 children to public school, a grandmother whose grandchildren will attend public schools, a mother of a teacher and most importantly a person who believes that all people, no matter of race, ethnicity or religion should be treated with respect and dignity. This curriculum does not do that, and I urge you to re-evaluate and change it.

My interest and concern is to include a rich history of Jewish life in America and the experiences of Jews as an ethnic minority group.
