There is no mention of Jews, the Jewish people, or anti-Semitism in this section, yet Jews are an ethnic minority and have been acknowledged, and discriminated against, as such for centuries all over the world, including in the United States. Why have they been excluded from the introduction to the suggested course of study? Line 4723: "That's where property rights came in. With secure property rights anyone could become successful, from an immigrant Jew like Lionel Cohen and his famous Lionel toy trains to an Austrian bodybuilder-turned-millionaire actor and governor like Arnold Schwarzenegger"... The Jewish immigrant in the U.S. is here linked to one of the oldest and most destructive tropes of anti-Semitism, an obsession with money. While perhaps germane here to the discussion of property rights, where are other examples of Jewish immigrants excelling at pursuits not related to making money? There is no mention of the Jewish people, anti-Semitism, or the Holocaust here.
Again, no mention of the Jewish people, anti-Semitism, or the Holocaust.

Line 4047: "After Pearl Harbor, the unit moves into the ways the US transitioned into a war time economy and a state of total war as well as the civil rights issues that arose out of that (including the role of women in the war effort, Executive Order 9066 and Korematsu v. U.S., general divisions among African Americans about serving and other issues of tension created by the Second Great Migration, the Zoot Suit Riots, anti-Semitism and the limited response to the Holocaust, etc). Specific attention is paid to comparing and contrasting"... This is one of a mere two mentions of the Holocaust in the entire curriculum, and even here, it is the trailer into an "etc." No other ethnicity that endured the loss of so staggering a number-- six million--as did the Jewish people of Europe during that war.
