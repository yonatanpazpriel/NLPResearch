Your document is anti-semitic Especially about the BDS movement.
The immigration laws in the 1920's were not directed at Arabs but at Jews and Italians. Wow. Let's ignore history and promote anti-Semitism! The words to the songs are anti American. Why are you trying to turn American children into anti-Semites? This curriculum should be thrown out and rewritten with a neutral viewpoint. I am astounded that the Dept. of Education would even countenance such a hateful document. Shame on you...
