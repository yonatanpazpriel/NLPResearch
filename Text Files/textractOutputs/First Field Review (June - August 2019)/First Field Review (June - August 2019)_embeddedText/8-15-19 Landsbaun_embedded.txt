It is impossible to comprehend an Ethnic Studies curriculum that completely omits Jews as an ethnic group and their experience, anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, emigration to the United States, experience of discrimination in the United States, etc., etc. This omission is anti-Semitic. "Israel-Palestine" and "Israel/Palestine" is not a country. Israel is an independent country recognized throughout the world. The refusal to identify it as such is anti-Semitic.
