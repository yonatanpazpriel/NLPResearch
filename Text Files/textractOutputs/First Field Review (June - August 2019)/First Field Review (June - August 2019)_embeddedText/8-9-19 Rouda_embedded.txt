I am a 53 year old Jew, attorney and playwright and 4th generation native of San Francisco. I am very dismayed to hear the level of indoctrination that has been included in the proposed High School ethnic studies curriculum for the State of California. Specifically that the Jewish experience in the United States, Israel, and around the world, that is largely in response to extreme anti-Semitism, has been virtually ignored in this curriculum. This in the midst of some of the most rapid increases in anti-Semitism in the United States' history.
As for Israel, it portrays Israel as an apartheid state and ignores the very Foundation of this state which was both from biblical times and to protect Jews from genocide and anti-Semitism that had virtually wiped them out in Europe.
Education is not supposed to be indoctrination but a means by which to see two sides of an issue and be able to debate it intelligently.
I am shocked that a state as ethnically diverse and progressive as California has utterly ignored the history and experience of a significant minority group in their midst and in the world when fashioning this ethnic studies program.
Please revise this curriculum to accurately reflect the Jewish experience with anti-Semitism and the history of Israel in response to the continuing attempt by many, to wipe Jews off the face of the Earth. Wiping the curriculum clean of the Jews' experience is not only negligent but dangerous.
