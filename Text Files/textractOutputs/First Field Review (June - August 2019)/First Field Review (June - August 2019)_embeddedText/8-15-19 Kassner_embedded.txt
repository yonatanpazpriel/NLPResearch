From: L.G. Kassner Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 7:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Urge you to reject racist and anti-American "model" ethnic curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
To approve this curriculum will make you 0 for 3 in my book. Think again reasonably and decently and REJECT THE ETHNIC MODEL CURRICULUM. If you pass it you could end up in an expensive lawsuit over it.
WHY YOU ARE 0 FOR 3:
JEWS: The proposed model ethnic studies curriculum is blatantly anti-Semitic which promotes hate speech, religious intolerance, classic nasty stereotypes and potentially increased violence against Jews, an ethical and law abiding community that has contributed positively to the U.S. since the 1600s. This curriculum teaches racism in the guise of "ethnic diversity and understanding." Read the quote by U.S. Pres. John Adams: Jews have done more to make the world moral and civil than anyone else. Your curriculum dept must need to go back to school.
ISRAEL: The creation of this curriculum is biased and promotes unfair perspective on Israel, a nation that has contributed hugely to the whole world and is the only democracy and the U.S.'s best ally in the Middle East.
AMERICAN SYSTEM: why you think promoting an anti-capitalist agenda that would threaten to upend the foundations of this country is a good idea, is beyond me...unless of course you are looking to teach the youth of our society to pursue a social revolution by undercutting the fabric of our society. What is wrong with you folks?
**So you are being racist and anti-American to boot. Shame on you.**
Think reasonably. Dump this curriculum.
Sincerely, Lisa Kassner
