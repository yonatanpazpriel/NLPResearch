The Introduction � Although the introduction to the proposed curriculum states that its goal is to help students develop an understanding and respect for diversity, the curriculum fails to do that by providing information on one group in particular (BDS) without a fair representation of any opposing perspectives. The glossary does not give an accurate definition of BDS and their goals

p.234 � A false equivalent is presented here � equating Israel's efforts to stop terrorist attacks with the U.S. border policies p.237 � uses unclear language implying "Israel-Palestine" as an Arab country

p.256, 264-69 uses a poem presenting harsh language about Israel with no content presenting any the positive perspectives on Israel

In the interest of promoting inclusion and rejecting boycotting and dividing, additions to the curriculum might include issues faced by the Jewish community and other minorities who have suffered through out history during the Holocaust, in other Mid-Eastern countries, and the Soviet Union. Rising anti-Semitism, white supremacy and hatred throughout the world certainly illustrate how important it is for our students to be educated appropriately - If we are to teach students how to form their own views, we have a responsibility to provide them with clear, accurate, complete and unbiased information. Unfortunately, it feels like this proposed curriculum defeats its stated purpose by presenting only the biased perspective of BDS.
