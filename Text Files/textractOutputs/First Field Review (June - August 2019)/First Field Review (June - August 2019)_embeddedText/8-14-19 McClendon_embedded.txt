My family and I are against the Ethnics Study Curriculum. We do not want schools teaching our children whatever your committee decides. As the children's parents and elders we should have a voice and do have a voice regarding what California schools are teaching OUR children. We do not and will not support this Ethics Study Curriculum! Sent from my iPhone
