From: Leigh Scott Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 3:35 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern, We got together to review and discuss the curriculum. We find it politically biased, angry, historically inaccurate, and tainted by fictional terminology. We believe this will not facilitate positive reasoned thinking in our children. Worse of all, the curriculum is not ethical. We could say more, but we have determined that something so flawed as this.......is not worth fixing. If you care about our children, please dump this document and start over. Sincerely, Leigh Scott Randal White Tiffany Johnson LaWanna Wright Mary Jones
