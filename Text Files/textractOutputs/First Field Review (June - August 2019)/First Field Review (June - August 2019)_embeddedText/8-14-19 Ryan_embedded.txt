I am writing to petition not approving the new ethnic studies model curriculum. In this new curriculum, it removes antisemitism as bigotry, and it pushes a pro BDS, anti Israel agenda. This message is dangerous, and is reminiscent of too many times in history that Jews went from prosperous productive members of a society, to persecuted and fleeing for their lives. Things can change quickly, and this hatred should be stopped early. Thank you Laurene Ryan
