Why Teach Ethnic Studies?
Introduction
As early as the 1970s, some California public high schools began offering Ethnic Studies, positing that courses in the field would provide an opportunity to engage the hxrstory, cultures, contributions, perspectives, and experiences of groups that have been overlooked, hxrstorically marginalized, and often subjected to invisibility within mainstream courses. Numerous student outcome benefits of Ethnic Studies have been documented. The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to develop culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining, help schools better connect with native students and students of color, equip all students with the skills and knowledge to think critically about the world around them and to tell their own stories, empower students to be engaged socially and politically, enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism. In essence, Ethnic Studies helps improve the U.S. democracy by encouraging the participation of all students at all political, social, and economic levels.
