Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am alarmed by the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha, etc.
As a parent of California public schools students and concerned neighbor, I am astonished that you would indoctrinate our youth, by omission and commission, with regressive and hateful policies, particularly at a time when there is such divisiveness in the country.
My family supports diversity and inclusion, but opposes a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools," as the Jewish Legislative Caucus outlined in its evaluation of the proposed legislation.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Susan Berman Atherton, CA
