To whom it may concern:
Stop supporting a curriculum promoting misunderstanding of Israel and failing to address the ugly history of antisemitism!
As an Israeli American who's visited Israel every summer of my life, whose father operated a business with Palestinian partners in Gaza and Ramallah, who has personally visited those cities, I am appalled that the state's department of education would consider ANY curriculum that would include input from BDS supporting academics.
The situation in Israel is troubling to be sure - but the answer is not to foment misinformation and antisemitism, but rather to garner a full understanding of the facts which are:
1) Israel is the ONLY democracy in the middle east that supports freedom of religion and women's rights 2) Since it's birth in 1948, Israel has been surrounded by belligerent neighbors and attacked from within by terrorist groups who's stated mission is to annihilate the state and its inhabitants. 3) The Palestinian people are held hostage by HAMAS and ISLAMIC JIHAD whose policies promote antisemitism and strive to keep tempers boiling towards a war footing. I was in Gaza in 2000, just prior to the 2nd Intifada. Gazans were hoping for peace but knew that Arafat and the PLO were corrupt, lining their pockets with donations from the international community that were meant to lift quality of life within Gaza and the West Bank. They intentionally allowed HAMAS to operate within the SHATI refugee camp and kept the conditions squalid so the terrorist organization would have a steady supply of disaffected and angry young men to serve as soldiers and martyrs in their war.
These points are just the tip of the iceberg that a thorough and true analysis would reveal - not a list of talking points from a biased group of professors.
Reconsider this curriculum!
