General

I'm very concerned that this curriculum is biased against capitalism and our way of life and promotes views that are not mainstream i.e. that capitalism is essentially racist and oppressive. Also, condemnation of Israel is also a biased attitude. These extreme views should not be part of this curriculum. Thank you.
