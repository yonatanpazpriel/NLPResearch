From: AL KATZ- Help Elders Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:50 PM To: SBE Subject: OBJECTION TO ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM
California State Board of Education
Dear California State Board of Education:
We are appalled that the State of California would even consider an educational curriculum that disrespects the Jewish People and the State of Israel. The minds of our precious youth must be filled with respect for Jews, Judaism, and Israel, particularly in this time of extreme antiSemitism, including deadly anti-Semitism, in California.
Not so many years ago, 60 million lives were lost for the sake of Jew-hatred. Isn't that enough?
Has the State of California lost sight of the dangers of Jew-hatred on its soil, in its youth, and in adults willing to commit anti-Semitic acts of violence grounded in their environmental and educational experiences and influences? Isn't 60 million lives lost enough?
Aren't wounded and dead synagogue worshippers bleeding out in California enough for the lesson of respect for Jews to be indelible in our educational system and all governmental bodies?
Beverly Newman, Ed.D.
