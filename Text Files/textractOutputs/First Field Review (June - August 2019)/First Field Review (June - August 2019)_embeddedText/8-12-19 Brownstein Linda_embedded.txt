From: Linda Brownstein Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 9:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond ; JIAC; Neill Brownstein Subject: PLEASE revise proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum!!!
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I and my whole family and community are alarmed and upset by the proposed flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which we believe to be flawed and unbalanced.
The idea of teaching an ethnic studies class is excellent, but should be done using a balanced point of view.
I ask and urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have two grandchildren and grandchildren of many close friends who will be effected by this. They could be put in seriously compromised positions should you not take action.
Experts also agree with me... Per California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter : We support diversity and inclusion, but oppose a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools."
- Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
� This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. � The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement. As Asad AbuKalil, Professor of Political Science and BDS leader at the University of California has said, "The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel."
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
