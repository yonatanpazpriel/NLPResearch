Regarding this quote: "These courses focus on the experiences of African Americans, Asian Americans, Chicanas/os and Latinas/os, American Indians, and other racialized peoples in the United States."
I'm not an expert in this, so if other people feel this is the best term, I understand. However, I am concerned that using the term "racialized" to refer to non-white people suggests that non-white people are the only one who have a racial/ethnic identity. This seems similar to me as when some foods are referred to as "ethnic food" or when people of color are referred to as "looking ethnic." Perhaps there is some context I'm missing, but I wanted to weigh in just in case.
