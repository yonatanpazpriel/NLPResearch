This is a terrible curriculum and I will never put my child in public school. I'm also goi g to share this with everyone I can. Racism will continue as long as people constantly base everything on race. This is systematic leftist brainwashing and indoctrination, not to mention abuse. You should be ashamed. I am ashamed of California.
