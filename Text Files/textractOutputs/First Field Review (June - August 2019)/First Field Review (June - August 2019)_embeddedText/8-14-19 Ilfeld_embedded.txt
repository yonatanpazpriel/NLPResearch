It is deeply troubling that there is no mention of anti-semitism in the curriculum, as I have personally experienced the hurt of others' ignorance while growing up in Sacramento and attending public high schools. I now have 3 kids in school in California, and they continue to experience acts of hate, that largely stem for ignorance. As the stated purpose of the curriculum is to "eradicate bigotry and hate," there absolutely should be lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those that fled the Holocaust and oppression in the Middle East, anti-semitism in the US, and a balanced perspective on Israel's role as the only homeland of the Jewish people.
