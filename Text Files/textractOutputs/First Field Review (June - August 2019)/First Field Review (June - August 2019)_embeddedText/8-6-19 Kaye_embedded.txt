Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The demonization and blatant bias against Israel is outrageous. The bibliography for the BDS movement, presented without context or counter viewpoint, is upsetting and insulting. Referring to Israel as `apartheid' is a lie that will indoctrinate young minds to hate Israel. The explanation of the BDS goals without explaining the many legislative efforts and compelling anti-boycott arguments, further entrenches the bias. I will never permit my children to learn this curriculum in its current form. There are many, many other examples in other parts of the proposed curriculum that need modification to provide a counterbalanced pro-Israel perspective. The complete negation of the contribution and challenges facing California Jews also needs to be remedied.
