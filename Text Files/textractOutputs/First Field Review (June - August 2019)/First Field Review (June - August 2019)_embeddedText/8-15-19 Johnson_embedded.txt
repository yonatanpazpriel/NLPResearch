Reading the Introduction was an enlightening exercise in deciphering new and often recently invented terminology and the stated "purposeful respellings" (Page 2 Line 34). The determined distortion of language and intentional introduction of unfamiliar and socially/politically manipulated terminology comes with implied intent to foster inclusivity, but is instead disorienting and discordant. For instance, the word "Hxrstory" (Page 1 Line 7) requires the first trip to the glossary and is also the first of many terms that is distorted. The drafters' motive perceived by the reader for including this alternative English is to disorient the reader or reviewer so he or she loses heart and interest and goes no further into the document. It is armor to protect the draft against honest and critical review.

It is telling that the authors of this document found it necessary to state within the document that: "Terms utilized throughout this document, which may be unfamiliar to new practitioners of the field, are defined in the glossary (Page 2 Lines 37-38)". Additionally, the footnote on Page 1 reads as follows: "1 Throughout this model curriculum, language is used that deliberately offers an alternative to traditional wording that could have a particular context within the dominant culture. More information about these terms can be found in the Glossary."

There are many unfamiliar words, and there are also familiar words that may have newly-adapted definitions. The reader is well served to keep the glossary handy for

frequent reference. It does not take long to conclude that there are social and ideological components to the definitions that do not represent the classic meanings of the terms. The word meanings have often been admittedly adapted to accommodate the conclusions of the course.

It is safe to say that when particular and leading language and politically/socially motivated definitions are placed in a curriculum, teachers must incorporate that language and those concepts in the manner stated in the document; then they must pass those definitions and concepts on to students. This is injecting ideologically manipulated lessons that can only be interpreted as indoctrination of students into one or more one-sided political and/or social philosophies. This has no place in what is required to be an unbiased model curriculum.

Achieving mutual respect is entirely possible and better achieved without these manipulative, often inaccurate, and totally biased influences.

This is arguably the most troublesome definition of many, but it is instructive as to the manipulation and inherent bias injected throughout the language, terminology, and social/political theme of the proposed model curriculum.
To include the language that BDS "is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" is not accurate. The conclusion of bias and social/political indoctrination in the curriculum cannot be avoided based on this definition. Apartheid is an accusation against Israel that has no basis in fact.
PJTN is particularly focused on the issue of anti-Semitism and attuned to untruthful portrayals of Israel and the Jewish people.

The use of terminology and language in the Course Overview is very suggestive of an attempt to inject a presupposed thought pattern into what is intended to be an ethnic studies curriculum. This is a manipulative global/progressive/humanistic representation, that moves beyond study and into human core values and morality; this is not the purpose of public education. Using terms such as "intersectional and global understanding", "interlocking systems of oppression and privilege", and "fostering of humanism" may represent the standards of the authors, but imposing their beliefs on students is, at its core, immoral. Particularly, the "fostering of humanism", is of concern because it is in direct conflict with the fostering of faith inherent in the Judeo/Christian founding and history of the United States and undermines the religious values of many.

Additionally, the intent that is inherent in the final sentence must be examined. The concluding wording: "engaging in civic action, community service and/or community education to dismantle white supremacy and institutional racism" is a bold indication of one-sided activism intent. It is not the purpose of public education to indoctrinate, train, and activate students on social/political issues. The goal of ethnic studies should be to promote truthful understanding of cultures based on accurate portrayals of all possible ethnic groups.

PJTN must reiterate that the drafters must not be permitted to use the model curriculum to promote political, ethnic or religious enmity towards any group or weaponize high school students to take action based on enmity towards any race, religion, group or individual.

Having spent a lot of time reviewing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and examining the embedded links to additional information, it becomes clear that the curriculum is terribly flawed. The curriculum has been developed by first using invented and purposely slanted language and definitions. This is the core of the curriculum and it is rotten. This rot spreads to the entire document, particularly the choice of material linked from the primary document. This utterly biased and, for the most part, inaccurate material in many of the links, must be removed.

This model curriculum, and any other curriculum which may resemble it or have anything in common with it, must not become the basis for student studies. Such distortion and inaccuracy clearly represent imbedded biases that run deeply through the entire program. Regrettably, PJTN believes that the curriculum is flawed beyond revision; it must be abandoned and then a new model honestly researched and written and fact checked.

It is a relief that the State Board of Education has issued a press release stating that: "A model curriculum should be accurate, free of bias and appropriate for all learners". PJTN will continue to follow the progress of this and other proposed curricula.

Thank you for your consideration and for the opportunity to offer comments.
