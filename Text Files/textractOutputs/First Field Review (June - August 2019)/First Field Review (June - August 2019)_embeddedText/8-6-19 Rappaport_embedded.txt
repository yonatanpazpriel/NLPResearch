From: Jill Rappaport Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 2:31 PM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Anti-Israel bias
Please do not allow hatred to flourish in California public schools by promoting the BDS movement or anti-Israel sentiments in the ethnic studies course. This program does nothing to inform students about Jewish history and the history of anti-semitism.
The Palestinians need to come to the peace table with Israel, instead of practicing terrorism and trying to destroy Israel. You hurt American Jews as well with this insertion into your school program.
Respectfully, Jill Rappaport Robin Olimb Jake Olimb members of Temple Adat Shalom Poway, California
