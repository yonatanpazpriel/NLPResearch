Dear Kenneth McDonald, I hope that this proposed curricula won't be approved as it is clearly divisive and anti-Israel which in America is the new way to be antisemitic without being unpopular. We don't need more polarization in our country. We came here for peace and unity. This curriculum is pro-BDS, neglects to include Jews as an ethnic minority, and promotes aggression against Israel, which in turn can create an unsafe learning environment and the marginalization of Israeli-American and Jewish-American students. Please do the right thing and remove this proposed curriculum from your agenda.
Regards, Dan Adivi
