From: ronald becker Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: anti-Jewish bias
the model curriculum for ethnic studies, rather than a model for inclusivity, seems to be a model for deliberately excluding Jews. aside from the political nature of the document, it seems to be written by a committee of non native english speakers using obscure technical jargon and neologisms. Very disappointed.
