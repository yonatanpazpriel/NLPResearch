From: Daniel Levinsohn Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 7:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Kenneth McDonald Subject: I am opposed to the proposed curriculum
To whom it may concern: I am writing to respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. As an American Jew and California resident, I find the current curriculum proposal unacceptable. Particularly page 2 of the online document as well as pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264269. Currently there is an upsurge in antisemitism and your proposed curriculum adds to this hateful rhetoric. Perhaps, instead of this prejudiced and polemical proposal, you could consider including lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled and were slaughtered in the Holocaust- much of my family included, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination/oppression in the former Soviet Union. I will continue to follow the results of this proposal/ your personal involvement and support your commitment against antisemitism and other forms of hate. Sincerely, Daniel Levinsohn
