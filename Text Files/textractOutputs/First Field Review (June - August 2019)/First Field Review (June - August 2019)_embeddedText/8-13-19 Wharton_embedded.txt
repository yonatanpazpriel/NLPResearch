From: Sandra Wharton Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your new curriculum
To Whom it May Concern,
Please rethink your new program. It is my understanding that you have left out any positive reference to Jews and several other California minority groups such as Koreans. I would expect much more of an open viewpoint in your text books. Israel is not an apartheid State which you could easily see if you went there. You are going to create a very unwelcome experience for many of your residents. I have family in California and I am aware of their distress should you proceed with this unbalanced and inaccurate curriculum. Please rethink your presentation. Sincerely yours,
