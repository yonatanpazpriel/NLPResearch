From: Stan Roodman Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 12:06 PM To: CFIRD ; Ethnic Studies Subject: New Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I would like to suggest that the new curriculum be rewritten by those who are not openly hostile to Israel and Jews. It is very hard to understand how so blatantly Antisemitic ideas could have gotten this far in a proposed Ethnic studies curriculum. Just about everything about BDS and Israel is false and needs to be rewritten from the beginning. I would be more than happy to assist in this project. Sincerely, Stanford Roodman, Ph.D. Retired Professor, Saint Louis University Santa Rosa, Ca 95404
