From: Richard Carmel Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:24 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Please amend the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to eliminate all curricula which can be tools of political indoctrination promoting hatred and inciting harm against any race, religion, group, nation or individual. The current language omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel. Thank you, Richard J Carmel, MD, FACR
