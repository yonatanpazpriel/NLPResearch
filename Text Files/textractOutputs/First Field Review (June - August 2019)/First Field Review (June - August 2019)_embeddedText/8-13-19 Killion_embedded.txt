To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Brandon Killion and I have worked as a teacher in the state of California for the past seven years teaching at both the high school and elementary school levels.
Working in education, I've heard from coworkers and administrators about the state's Ethnic Studies project. I read the piece by the Wall Street Journal and the Times of San Diego, as well as some Op Eds in the LA Times. Most of the arguments pointing out the flaws in the current state were convincing to me. In particular, the evidence pointing to the idea that the framework is written with an antisemitic perspective was damning.
I looked at some of the files posted on the CDE's site (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/esmcpubliccomment.asp) and am apprehensive about the framework's approach to content by taking an almost exclusive deconstructionist take (a la Derrida). To be fair, some of the essential questions are posed in such a way to provide opportunities to see the benefits and negatives of both sides, the content itself is framed to lead students to deconstruction and specifically with one target viewpoint in mind.
All this to say, I am generally uneasy about the direction of the framework. I believe it is important for students to view and examine social strata and foundations of sociology. However, to make it a required class for graduation and push a specific narrative is not the ideal way to move forward.
I don't expect a human reply to this email and I'm not sure what effect this message will have. However, I felt it my civic duty and educational duty to put forth my two cents.
Thanks, Brandon Killion
