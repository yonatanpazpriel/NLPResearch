Simply, it is impossible to justify ignoring the need for Arab Studies. We can never grasp and understand each other and our histories and cultures without them.
� I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1 of the full study, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.
� I support the objectives listed on page 233 of the full study which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
� Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) of the full study is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
I strongly encourage you read the study and respond positively to the need to include these doors to our minds.
