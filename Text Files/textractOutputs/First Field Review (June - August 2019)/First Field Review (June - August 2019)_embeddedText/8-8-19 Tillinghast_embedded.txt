From: Stanley Tillinghast Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Gentlemen {sic}:
The proposed curriculum is only the latest attempt to foist a demonstrably false identity politics agenda on California's schoolchildren. It is the current culmination of the Gramscian effort to destroy the United States and its society. The United States is the least racist, least oppressive, most prosperous major country in the history of the world. Prior to the onset of the institution of representative democracy in the United States, and its subsequent spread to many parts of the world, the world was a far worse place. People continue to come here, legally and illegally, not because of white supremacy or capitalist oppression, but because our country offers the greatest hope for freedom, opportunity, and prosperity to be found anywhere. You, however, are doing your best to destroy all of that, and replace it with a divided country of indoctrinated slaves to your socialist power-grab. If this curriculum is instituted as written, it should be considered child abuse to allow one's children to attend California public schools.
Sincerely, Stanley J Tillinghast MD
