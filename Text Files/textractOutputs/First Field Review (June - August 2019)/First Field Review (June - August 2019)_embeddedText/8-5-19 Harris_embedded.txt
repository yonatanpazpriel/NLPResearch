Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2 of the glossary lauds BDS as a movement aimed at promoting freedom. I think that BDS promotes hatred of Jews. Both sides of this issue should be presented. Israel is not treated as a legitimate country; there is only Israel/Palestine, treated essentially as a single entity. Pages 237 (5030) and 241(5138) and 268 (5802) There are 2 sides to the BDS issue; only support is provided, no criticism. BDS promotes hatred and division Page 242: only the Palestinian perspective about the 1948 war is presented Pages 264-9: the poem criticizes only Israel, no criticism of any Palestinian leaders Why is no discussion whatsoever provided about Jews and anti-semitism?
