From: Caryl Schwartz Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 9:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Chairwoman Chao:
I am writing you regarding my concerns about the current version of the state's ESMC. I have had 3 children that graduated from the CA. public school system. As a parent, I was very disappointed about the lack of historical information regarding WWII, antisemitism, and the Holocaust. Unfortunately, the proposed ESMC program does not resolve the problem and incorporates anti-Jewish stereotypes and depicts Israel in a negative light. The Middle East has complicated politics and the curriculum inappropriately attacks Israel by supporting BDS rhetoric.
A Jewish Ethnic Studies Program should include the contributions of Jewish cultural icons in music, theatre, art, and science to American society.
Thank you,
