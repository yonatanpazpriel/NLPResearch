[page 2 lines 30 through 40�The BDS movement was founded by Omar Barghouti and is a continuation of anti-Jewish boycotts of the 1920s and 1930s that predated the 1948 founding of the state of Israel. In those days during the British mandate Arabs posted billets advocating for the boycotting of all Jewish owned business in the then state of Palestine. Later boycotts of Jewish owned business followed in 1930s and 1940s Europe. Barghouti has openly stated that his goal is the destruction or removal of the state of Israel. This has nothing to do with Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. There are numerous videos online of Arabs in Gaza visiting restaurants, malls, supermarkets like meat city, hotels etc. They are not living in a Soweto like apartheid. They living under Hamas rule free of Jews.]

Page 242 lines 5154 through 5163-The sentence "The largest single group was
Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from
the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War)." Is over simplified and highly misleading. Arabs living in the area were advised to leave in preparation for war and promised that they would be able to return after the invading Arab armies of Egypt, Jordan etc were victorious. They ended up losing the conflict so those that left could not return and ended up being lifelong inter-generational refugees in the surrounding countries of Lebanon, Syria and Jordan where they could not vote, get educated or work and were resigned to live in refugee camps. Those Arabs that remained against advice went on to become Israeli citizens and their offspring are judges, lawyers, doctors, soldiers and even voted in member of government. That is not apartheid. Furthermore, this section completely ignores the hundreds of thousands of Jews that were expelled from the surrounding countries including Iraq, Egypt, Jordan etc and forced to move to the new country of Israel. Their property was expropriated and they arrived in Israel with empty hands and empty pockets. To call one side of this catastrophic while ignoring the other side is a travesty. Page 263 lines 5673 through page 264 line 5180-Who in their right mind would allow songs glamorizing bomb makers while denigrating Senator McCain to be in text books in a California school
Page 267 lines 5774 through page 269 line 5804-really get out Yankees from latin America, this is so ridiculous it does not even need explanation
