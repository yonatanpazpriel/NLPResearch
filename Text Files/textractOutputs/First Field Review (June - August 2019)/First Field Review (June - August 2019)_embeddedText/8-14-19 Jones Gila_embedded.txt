I heartily agree that American school curricula generally over-emphasize the contributions and accomplishments of straight white males, and that change is needed. I also agree that ethnic studies serve an important role in a diverse society, and that awareness of cultural differences serves to unite us as Americans, helps increase achievement among minority and female students, and reduces instances of bullying, among other positive effects.
I know the State Board has already received many comments about the problems in the draft curriculum, and recognizes that it "falls short and needs to be substantially redesigned." I appreciate your acknowledgement of these problems.

I want to make one other point, however.

As others have communicated, the proposed curriculum is perceived by many � including many very progressive Californians � as highly political and propagandistic. And in spite of the State Board's recent public recognition of this problem, it's too late. The damage is already done.

While the majority of Californians, including me, hold left-of-center views, a very large number do not. And whenever an entity that's part of California government takes an extreme position such as was taken in the draft Ethnic Studies curriculum, more people pull their children out of public school. More people decide to flee the state.

I'm delighted that the State Board has apparently sent the draft curriculum back to the drawing board. But the fact that this truly awful document was even made public is reprehensible. It communicates inadequate respect for all segments of California society. It demonstrates an embarrassing absence of awareness of public perceptions. It shows an arrogant lack of recognition of who our audience is when we -- the servants of the People of California � communicate.

We work for them: they do not work for us.

The damage is already done. The tree fell in the woods and lots of people who heard it have now stopped listening. When a new draft is available, many of those who objected to the first draft will not be there to hear the next tree fall. They have already decided to remove their children from a California public school. The damage is already done.
