From: Smiley, Brent Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I urge you to take a hard look at how the model curriculum handles American Jewry. Having spent the last decade watching the Ethnic Studies Program develop I have marveled at the inclusive nature of curriculum in my district (LAUSD) and others like El Rancho under the tutelage of Jose Lara, a school board member who gets it.
The model should be celebrating our diversity, all of us, telling all of the stories, clearly, with truth being the guiding factor.
As a classroom teacher, I depend on you to approach this in a fair and open way and to adopt programs and curriculums that give me the framework to explain the world, warts and all, to my students.
Thank you for your time
