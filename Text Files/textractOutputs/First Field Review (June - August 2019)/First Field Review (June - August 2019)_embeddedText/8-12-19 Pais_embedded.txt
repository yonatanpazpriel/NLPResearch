From: m. joyce pais Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 2:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Please consider my strong objection to the proposed curriculum as it is now written. It requires extensive revision in order to be of any educational value, student experience and/or learning by critical thinking.
The important Jewish experience in the growth of California is incomplete and full of errors , especially in not including a non biased discussion on Israel, antisemitism and the entire Jewish experience in the origins and development of the state of California.
