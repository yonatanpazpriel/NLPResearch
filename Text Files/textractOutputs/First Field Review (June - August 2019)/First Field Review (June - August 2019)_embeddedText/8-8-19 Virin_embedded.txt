In general I think it is a good idea to have a class where students learn about different ethnic groups. However it feels like the current proposal is biased to some ethnic groups and not others. There is a detailed program on how to talk about the problems of Arab immigrants, often coming from Palestine with reference to Israel and Jews, but there is no program to teach about the immigration problems that Jews have encountered when they fled Nazim and were turned down by the US. I think it is very important to make it clear that all minorities in the US have to deal with these kind of issues, stereotypes etc, and that the Arabs are by no means are getting any special treatment here. The Italians, Jews and immigrants from Germany and Ireland all were treated badly at some point during the immigration waves, not to mention what happened to Japanese people. Excluding some groups and not mentioning them at all, gives the false feeling that these groups were the preferred groups in America from some reason.

Page 233 - BDS movement. I think in general it is important to talk about different movements as our society is created out of those. With no relation to whether a movement is doing something which is right or wrong, it is important to know about the existence of such and be aware of their agenda and goals. However, with the relation to the Arab program, there are a few movements which seem not to be covered in the curriculum. The Hamas movement, the Fatah movement and the Hezbollah movement, to name a few. These are extreme movements which played a huge role in why Arab immigrants are fleeing these regions. I think it is important to know about these movement and be able to understand that not every Palestinian is a Hamas of Fatah fighter, and non every Lebanonian is a Hezbollah soldier, the same way as not every Israeli is not associated with current Israel's government or its army. Otherwise, I strongly feel that the curriculum gets very biased and gives an opportunity for misunderstanding and possible division of students in the class.

We will have soon three boys (two already) attending the public school system in California, and would not like for other kids to start getting anti social with them, because it might seem like they or their parents might be responsibly for the oppressions of Arab immigrants. If the material is laid out in a scientific, objective and unbiased way, then I think the negative effects will be minimized.
