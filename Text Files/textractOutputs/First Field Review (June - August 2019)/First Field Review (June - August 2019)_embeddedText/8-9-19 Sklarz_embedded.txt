I am concerned that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is inaccurate and misleading, and may contribute to a bias against people of the Jewish faith/ancestry. The recent increase in reports acts of antiSemitism and violence against Jewish institutions (e.g. Poway Synagogue shooting in 2019) indicate that there has been a lack of thought in developing the curriculum. I would respectfully ask that Commission take such matters seriously and revise the curriculum to address the issue of anti-Semitism historically and in the present day.
