From: alan segal Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 3:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: anti-semitic, anti-Israel pro BDS curriculum about to be made mandatory (AB331) in California schools.
To all concerned.
Radical Islamic anti-Israel, pro BDS (Boycott, sanction and divestment Movement) propaganda must not be allowed and especially not made mandatory (AB331) as part of California's ethnic studies cirriculum.
The goal of the founder's of the BDS movement is a one state solution that calls for the extinction of Israel. This anti-Israel, anti-Jew, propaganda, must never be enabled or endorsed in California education!
"The State of California has approved legislation that creates an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC") for public school students. The initial bill approved the curriculum as an optionalinitiative approved by the California Department of Education. However, a second bill, AB-331, is now under consideration that would make Ethnic Studies a mandatory requirement for graduation. The committee tasked with developing the curriculum had a strong radical-left orientation. The drafting committee included several outspoken advocates of the antisemitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign that seeks to eliminate the State of Israel ("BDS"). The curriculum includes a substantial section on Arab-Americans that devotes space to explicitly promote the antisemitic BDS movement and to present Israel negatively. The material is devoid of factual content and historical context. A Glossary of terms provided by the curriculum developers includes every imaginable form of prejudice, except one ï¿½ antisemitism. It does, however, include a long and favorable description of BDS.

While ignoring antisemitism, including the alarming rise of antisemitism on college campuses, the curriculum devotes substantial resources to teaching about Islamophobia. This is despite the fact that year-after-year antisemitic incidents far outnumber anti-Muslim incidents according to the FBI. The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is consistent with initiatives proposed by the National Education Association (NEA), the nation's largest and most influential teachers union. If the California Ethnic Studies curriculum is allowed to move forward unrevised with its anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian indoctrination intact, it will serve as a model for the rest of the nation's public schools."
