I find the definition of BDS in your glossary (p2) to be very one-sided.
In general, your items pertaining to the Israel-Palestinian conflict are pure anti-Israel talking points. I strongly feel that they way you propose to handle this topic will contribute to increased anti-Semitism, which our Jewish students will have to bear.
In addition, there is so much in this document that is pure leftist indoctrination of our children. Since when do opinions become standard curriculum?
