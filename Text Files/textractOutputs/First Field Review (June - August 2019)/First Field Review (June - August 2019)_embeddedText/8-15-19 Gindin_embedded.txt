I am writing to thank the Board of Education for agreeing to revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I would still like to express my concern regarding the draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum so that the Board of Education understands what should be revised for the next draft. I believe that the draft Model Curriculum discouraged critical thought about the Jewish community, of which I am a part, and about the State of Israel, which I support.

The Curriculum addressed the historical importance of "African Americans, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Chicana/o/x/, Latina/o/x, and Native Americans" (Chapter 1, page 4, lines 87�88). I commend the Board of Education for casting a spotlight on historically overlooked groups of Americans. I note, however, the conspicuous absence of American Jews from the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As the draft of the Curriculum noted, the ethnic studies movement of the late 1960s called for "a new curriculum that would embrace the history of all people, including ethnic minorities" (Chapter 1, page 4, lines 99�100). I, a Jewish student, believe that all students in California stand to benefit from learning about Jews' historical experiences in the United States alongside the experiences of other minorities.

Curricula designed for California public schools should be nonpartisan and nonsectarian. I found that the draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum inappropriately took positions on a number of sensitive historical and current issues. As drafted, the Curriculum would have precluded students from studying multiple perspectives, engaging in critical thinking, and developing nuanced and well-informed opinions.

I would have expected the Arab American Studies Course to be taught without political bias. But the sample topics of the "Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel" (Chapter 2, page 234, line 4957) and of

"Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico" (Chapter 2, page 234, line 4958) were clearly oriented toward presenting a particular viewpoint and precluding student dispute and debate. The terms the draft Curriculum advised teachers to use when discussing these sensitive topics would have introduced bias and would not have given students the opportunity to form their own educated opinions. The draft Curriculum referred to the "1948 Palestine War" (Chapter 2, page 242, lines 5160�5161) and called Palestinian displacement the "Nakba," without any qualifiers (Chapter 2, page 242, line 5159). These terms, and others like them, are loaded signifiers, not neutral historical terms. They should be contextualized and presented within a nuanced and multi-perspective educational framework that enables students to develop their own voices and ideas.
According to the draft Curriculum, Palestinians are stereotyped as "terrorists, blow up airlines, try to `destroy Israel' and `drive the Jews into the sea' " (Chapter 2, page 259, lines 5561�5562). Surely these stereotypes exist. But the draft Curriculum fully ignored the history of violence of particular Palestinian individuals and subgroups, including actual calls to "destroy Israel" and to "drive the Jews into the sea." Acts of terror committed by Palestinians were entirely ignored in the curriculum. Leaving out the individual acts of terror would have kept the Curriculum from acknowledging Palestinians and other Arab leaders who have condemned terrorist attacks, terrorists' tactics, and terrorist groups. The draft of the Curriculum promoted an overly simplistic perspective, which would have prevented students from learning to contextualize these stereotypes while thinking critically about the situation.
The draft Curriculum encouraged students to study the BDS Movement (Chapter 2, page 234, line 4957), a movement that does not recognize or honor Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. BDS is an extremist movement. BDS should be taught, but it should be contextualized alongside moderate pro-Palestinian organizations that recognize Israel's right to be treated like every other state in the world.
As a high school student, I thank the Board of Education for giving the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum further discussion before its final release. I believe the addition of an American Jewish Studies Course to the Curriculum will allow students to learn about Jews' historical contribution to the United States. It will also help students understand the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the context of both many American Jews' and many Arab Americans' emotional connections to the conflict. In addition, an American Jewish Studies Course would give students the opportunity to study anti-Semitism. Given that anti-Semitic hate crimes rose 21 percent last year, according to a Department of Justice report released early last month, critical study of American Jewry and biases against it has perhaps never been more important.
Thank you for your consideration of my concerns and for your work on behalf of the students of the State of California.
