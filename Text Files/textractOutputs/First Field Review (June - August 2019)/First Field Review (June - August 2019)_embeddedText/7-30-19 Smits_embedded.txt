From: Teri Smits Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 4:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public opinion
As a recently retired CA public school teacher at the elementary level, I object to this curriculum. We need to be teaching social studies and history not ethnic studies. Teachers don't even have time to get those subjects in their school day as it is. Students need to be taught citizenship, accountability, and wise decision making skills. If they're given a strong foundation in those areas, we will be raising responsible citizens who respect themselves and all others. I hope this new curriculum is removed from consideration and adoption. Teri Smits
