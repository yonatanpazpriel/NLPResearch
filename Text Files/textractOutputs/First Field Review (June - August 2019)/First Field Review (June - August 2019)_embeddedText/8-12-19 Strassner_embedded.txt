I am writing to you as a parent of two children in California schools. I understand the importance of Cultural/Ethnic Studies. I attended UC Berkeley in the early 90s which had a major in Ethnic Studies even at that time. Ethnic studies should be about educating and promoting inclusion of cultures, not about marginalizing certain minorities. Therefore, I am writing you to request the revision of sections 5140-5142 which promotes and mainstreaming anti-semitism under the guise of cultural studies. As the grandchild of a holocaust survivor, this is also personally offensive.
Thank you,
