I have reviewed the Ethnic Studies Curriculum, especially the Appendices and am concerned by what I read. It appears to me that the Board is heading in the direction of revisionist history and political advocacy rather than historical education. Our children should not be lead to a specific ideological leaning, especially to identity politics. They should be learning critical thinking skills to allow them to evaluate and reach their own conclusions. Every child has the potential to reach their own greatness and victimhood needs to stop. Identity politics leads to victimhood. Please reconsider this curriculum and move toward true historical education.
