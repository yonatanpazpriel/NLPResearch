I also strongly support the inclusion of the units on Arab American history, which is so neglected in the mainstream curriculum. When I taught Ethnic Studies at Berkeley High, there was nothing about Arab American history or experience. When I included Arab American studies and Islamophobia as topics in my classes, all the students (Arab and non-Arab) told me how important this content was. For the Arab American students in particular, it was the first time they saw

their reality reflected at school. When I included this content in teacher education classes at San Jose State, my students told me it hadn't occurred to them to include Arab American issues or discussion or Islamophobia, despite the large

Arab American population in Silicon Valley.

Of course, it's important to include Jewish history and anti-Semitism in California curriculum, and it is already there. As you know, the 8th grade core literature curriculum includes The Diary of Anne Frank; in the Los Angeles School District, 8th graders take a field trip to the Los Angeles Museum of the Holocaust; the 10th grade core literature curriculum includes Elie Wiesel's Night. In high school US History and World History classes, core curriculum includes anti-Semitism, Jewish immigration through Ellis Island, genocide and extensive study of the Holocaust during World War II.

As a Jew, I am deeply ashamed when right-wing Jewish organizations start shouting about anti-Semitism whenever anything about Arab history or current reality is raised.

Arab American history is not anti-Semitic; talking about the impact on Palestinians of the formation of the Israeli state is not anti-Semitic; discussing the pros and cons of the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is not anti-Semitic. Some students may not agree with the goals or strategy, but that's not anti-Semitic. AntiSemitism is attacks on Jews as a religion and/or culture, not political disagreements with the policies of the Israeli state. In this era of rising racism, anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, Arab American students in California desperately need this content at school so they are not made invisible or demonized, and all our students need this content as part of becoming critical thinkers and participants in an inclusive democracy.
