I find the nearly complete lack of discussion of the Jewish-American experience appalling, as well as a great disservice to the intended student audience, and the American Jewish community. The contributions of the Jewish-American community and the waves of immigration starting with the Revolutionary War are too innumerable and important to even start to list. The lack of discussion of anti-semitism is likewise an egregious oversight, given the indelible nature right up to the present day of bigotry and discrimination against Jewish Americans Line 4992 The references to Nakba and Palestine War of 1948 are clear misrepresentations of historical reference and insulting, to say the very least.

Line 5241 to 5245. The implications here are so patently false, bordering on libelous, as to be laughable. There is absolutely NO evidence whatsoever to support such a conclusion
