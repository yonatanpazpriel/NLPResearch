From: Carol Woodward Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 6:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Stop hateful rhetoric about Isreal
Stop hateful rhetoric in the current curiculum. Israel has a right to exist and defend itself from those who wish to cause harm. There have been a number of opportunities to make peace, but the palistinian authorities and Hamas and the Gaza government won't give it a chance.
