I support the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a prerequisite to earning educational promotion, certificates, diplomas, credentials, or degrees. I personally benefited from the agency-building effect of an ethnic studies assignment in a creative studies elective course that I took while an engineering undergraduate student at UC Irvine between 2002 and 2007. I often wonder how to expand such impacts on second-generation people, like myself, beyond the college classroom; and this requirement would serve as a great first step to expanding that impact for a more inclusive society. I have siblings who have not completed college and who I believe could have similarly benefited from ethnic studies courses. I support including ethnic studies in one form or another from preschool to postgraduate school curriculum.
