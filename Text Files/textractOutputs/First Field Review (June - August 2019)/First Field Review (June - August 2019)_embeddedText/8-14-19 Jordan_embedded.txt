To the State of California:
Regarding this article - https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-13/ethnic-studiescurriculum-fall-short-state-board-leaders-say
"Allen said he fully supports an ethnic studies requirement for high school graduation and believes it's appropriate for the focus to remain on California's four major communities of color: African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos and indigenous communities."
Isn't the 'State' comprised of more than these named communities of color?
Does ethnicity only apply to communities of color?
Here's the definition of ethnicity:
eth�nic�i�ty /eTHnisd/ Learn to pronounce noun 1. the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition.
According to the definition, ethnicity refers to social groups who have some element of commonality, like nationality or culture. Why would the 'State' then choose to place a focus on only certain ethnic communities of color rather than on others?
Shouldn't all ethnicities be studied evenhandedly in a taxpayer financed public State ethnic studies curriculum intended for its public education system? Wouldn't it be a form of discrimination, to focus on some communities in favor of others? Thank you for your consideration. Best, Kathy Jordan
