From: Umayyah Cable Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 10:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Support for Arab American studies
Greetings:
I am an assistant professor at Purchase College, State University of New York. I did my graduate degree at USC in Los Angeles. I lived in California for over a decade. More than that, as a Palestinian American, I have deep family ties in California: the many of my mother's family members relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the war in 1967.
I am writing to express my support for the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. Since California has one of the largest Arab American communities in the entire country, it s imperative to acknowledge Arab existence and experience in California by including it in the curriculum.
I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students. Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
Thank you for your consideration.
Best,
