Although the Model Curriculum states that its main goals are to increase cultural sensitivity and provide an antidote to White Supremacists, it does not include Jews as a cultural group worthy of discussion. Since Jews in America are clearly increasingly a target of violence and domestic terrorism, this oversight must be corrected and a section on Jewish history and anti-Semitism included. Instead, in the discussion of Arab-Americans, as noted below be specific page and line numbers, the curriculum takes an anti-Israel/anti-Jewish stance that will intensify, rather than defuse, anti-Jewish sentiment Page 234, line 4956 plans to discuss the Direction Action Front for Palestine. This is not an Arab-American group, but is an anti-Israel, anti-Jewish group focusing on one Middle East issue. Page 234, line 4957 plans to discuss the Boycott, Divest and Sanction/Israel and line 4958 plans to discuss Palestinian border issues. Again it appears that the focus is anti-Israel rather than dealing with the broad question of Arab-Americans the focus appears to be Palestinian anti-Israel sentiment. Page 242, lines 5158-5161 refers to Nakba or "Catastrophe" resulting from the 1948 War. Again the focus here is anti-Israel and anti-Semitic since there are multiple ways of looking at the 1948 war, although the curriculum does not appear to intend to discuss any view other than the Palestinian view.

Page 263-268 includes a rap song that states line 5656 "in Palestine kids can't shop at these malls and concludes with line 5792 " I love you free Palestine". Again the focus here is anti-Israel/anti-Semitic and takes clear sides in a complex political situation without any indication that alternative viewpoints will be presented.
