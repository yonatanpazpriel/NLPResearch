P 4, line 87: Capitalism, per se, may not be evil or bad. Greed is. Capitalism as practiced in
the U.S. after WW II led to an explosion of the middle class and companies provided many benefits to workers. The spread in pay between workers and top management was nowhere as great as it is today. The present debasement of capitalism began in this century with the passing of tax laws that greatly reduced taxes on the wealthy and increased them on the middle class. Arguably, one can make the case that capitalism should not be demonized.
p. 4, line 100: The authors of this document should be aware that women may be as guilty as
men in practicing discrimination against the opposite sex. Personally, I worked for a woman in one of my jobs and felt I was discriminated against as she would only promote other women, notwithstanding letters of commendation that I received from agencies I interfaced with.
p. 7, line 167: Added a question as follows: Do you think future generations of
Americans will get the same request from children and infants being forcibly separated from their parents at the Mexican-U.S. border through national policies that prevent legal claims for asylum from being properly judicated?
p. 242, line 5161�5165: This sentence should be tempered with a comment such as: The
Palestinians were not forced out by the Jews in Israel, but left because of the orders from the Grand Mufti of the time. There is more to be said to explain their leaving. A balanced approach to this issue would be appreciated.

p. 245, line 5250: These narratives may be instructive. However, someplace in the
curriculum, you should include a general introduction to immigration to the U.S. These stories are not only common to the Arab immigrants of today, but also to the Italian, Irish, German, Scandinavian, and Jewish immigrants of the past. It would be wonderful to show that all these groups had similar experiences.
p. 259, line 5574: A good friend of mine happens to be a woman leader of a Sufi Muslim
branch. She was denied the formal leadership title that was due her by the male leader of this sect who resides in Turkey. Therefore, even Muslims of the highest order, namely Sufis, are guilty of prejudice towards their fellow women. Again, present a balanced approach. Prejudice does not only originate from white males.
