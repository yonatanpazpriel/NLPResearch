From: Michele P Katz Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 4:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: ; Tony Thurmond Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am a retired public school teacher and am alarmed by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the concept of teaching the ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or rewrite it consistent with the recommendations from the Legislative Jewish caucus letter,Stand With Us and others.
As a member of the Jewish community I am upset at a curriculum that denigrates both Israel and Jews. The one sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict may lead to Jewish students harassed and stereotyped. This curriculum is meant to alleviate prejudice and appears to marginalize Jews and fuel discrimination.
I ask you to make revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
