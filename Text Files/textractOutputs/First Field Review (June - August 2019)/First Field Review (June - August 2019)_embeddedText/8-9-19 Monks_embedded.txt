My primary objections to the proposed ethnic studies curriculum are as

follows:

The teaching of critical thinking is one of the most important aspects of an education. Students need be exposed to all sides of an issue to form their own conclusions. I have no problem with the teaching of ethnic studies classes that are inclusive of all elements of the United States population but this proposed curriculum discounts some groups in our society - especially the Jewish population. The United States is a nation of assimilation, not identity politics.

Capitalism is private ownership of trade and industry and has been dominant in the western world since feudal times - I fail to believe that it is oppressive and racist. To teach this is simply irresponsible.

A friend of mine who holds a double PhD. from Stanford read this article and observed that, if he were a parent, he would be furious that this curriculum is even being considered. The document is partisan and describes brain-washing. I shudder to think how much time and money were spent preparing it. The verbiage is downright embarrassing.

We are living in a very complex global economy and the more people know about themselves and others, the better off we'll all be. Understand the good and the not so good parts of society, work for social justice, and respect differences of opinion.
