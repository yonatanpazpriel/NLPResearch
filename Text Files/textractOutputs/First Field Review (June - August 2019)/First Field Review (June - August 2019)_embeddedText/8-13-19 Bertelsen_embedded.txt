Reading the proposed curriculum outlined on this site makes me worry that too much emphasis is given to a course a student can electively chose to explore in college. Ethnic studies is not going to advance student's educational success and adequately prepare them for college or trade schools. I am a strong advocate in helping my kids express themselves intelligently; I want to foster critical thinking and allow them to master core classes like math and English. This ethnic studies outline seems to be the agenda of a well meaning but misguided community of administrators that have no interest in developing strong minds nor academic excellence.
I'm also not in favor of perpetuating the ridiculous gendered pronouns that are riddled throughout the text of the guidelines. Speech and basic spelling are our universal method of communication. Bastardizing our common tongue by canceling out male and female references in words only weakens our ideas and how we communicate with one another.
Please do no force ideology like this on impressionable minds. Let them graduate from high school with a solid foundation. There's plenty of time for them to explore electives.
