Hi there,
I hope this finds you well. My name is Sabrina, and I'm a writer for Atlas Obscura. I'm interested in writing a story on the phasing out of mission dioramas in CA public school, and how the school system plans to rethink a more inclusive way of teaching the mission period. I'd love to speak with a representative of the CDE on the mechanics of this phase-out, how long it's been in the works, and what's coming next. Would you be able to connect me to the relevant person for this? Please let me know, and thanks so much for your time.
All best, Sabrina
