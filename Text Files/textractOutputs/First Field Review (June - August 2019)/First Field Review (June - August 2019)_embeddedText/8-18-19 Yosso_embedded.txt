I appreciate the opportunity to put forward this public comment as a scholar who has taught at the University of California in Chicana/Chicano Studies and Education for almost twenty years, and published extensively. The glossary and bibliography should be resources for teachers and should be in conversation. I am concerned because the glossary in its current form does not seem to be based in the literature, the terms seem to be disconnected from the bibliographical citations, some of the language of the definitions is not accessible for multiple audiences, and the bibliography is underdeveloped. For example, definitions for terms such as critical race theory, racial microaggresssions, and counternarrative are not consistent with the scholarship, and there are no citations for further study of the genealogies and development of these concepts.

In addition to asking that these concerns be addressed, I want to contribute to the efforts of those working to continue moving this important project forward, with a specific request that the next draft of this curriculum include the correct definition of "community cultural wealth," currently described incorrectly as cultural wealth in Lines 101-108. I also ask that the full bibliographical citation be included in the bibliography and associated

Lines 101-108�Please replace these lines with the correct text below and re-alphabetize accordingly
Community cultural wealth--an array of knowledges, skills, abilities, and contacts possessed and utilized by Communities of Color to survive and resist racism and other forms of oppression; there are at least six forms of overlapping community cultural wealth: aspirational, social, familial, navigational and resistant.
