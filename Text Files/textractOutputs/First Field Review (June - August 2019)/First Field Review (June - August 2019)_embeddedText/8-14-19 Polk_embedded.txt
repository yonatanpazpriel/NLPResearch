This curriculum is exactly what we need in this time, when families are being ripped apart and weapons produced that can decimate the planet. In this time it is even more important that we learn about how people are working in solidarity to see our common struggles. For this reason, I urge you to not back down to pressure from people to take out the struggle for Palestinian rights. This is crucial for young students to be able to learn about different ways to resist and fight for justice. Please keep the section about Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement for Palestine.
