As a Jewish California resident I am writing to share my deep concern, may I say that is an understatement, about this new curriculum. I cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism & would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. You have received much input from other Jewish organizations stating these obvious facts & much more. I specifically refer you to the letter of THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVE JEWISH CAUCUS, JULY 29,2019. Addressed to Ms. Soomin Chao. This letter is far more articulate than I. I have watched this state descend into a morass of anti-Jewis/ Israel hate for the last 20 years starting with UC Irvine & it's ugly spread to every college & university campus. No person in a position of authority has cared enough to stop the hate, & it's not because we haven't asked for help. If you allow this new curriculum to go forward you will be making the statement that this state would be very happy if every Jewish resident would go elsewhere to live. Because it will not be a safe place for our children to go to school. It's bad enough in California `s colleges & universities. This is not something a few tweaks in the curriculum will take care of, this needs to be soundly defeated & if really necessary, which I'm not sure it is, you need start over & include the rich Judeo part of the Judeo-Christian heritage that this country was founded on. Jews have played an extremely important part of the founding & creating of these United States, we are rich cultural heritage, not just a religion.
I am thanking you in advance for your curtesy in taking this letter under serious consideration,
