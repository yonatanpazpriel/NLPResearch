I am horrified to learn that the well found anti-semitic and anti-Israel biased and violent movement of BDS would even be considered in this country for anything, let alone being taught to our children. As the U.S. Congress recently and almost unanimously held, this movement is born of hate and prejudice, and at its core is anti-semitic and anti-Israel. What haters of Jews and Israel are trying to teach our children and future students is a rewrite of history, and to fill our children with their hate. It is at their core based on their organization's statements and actions. It is perhaps best evidenced by its drafters and proponents, noted and publicized haters of the Jewish people and our democratic ally Israel. Their hate, lie-filled propaganda should be rejected outright by any decent societal institution, particularly when it comes to the teaching and framing of young minds. There is no place in our society for these people, and their avowed espousal of hate and violence should be rejected resoundingly. .
