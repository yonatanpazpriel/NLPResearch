From: Lesli Stein Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum
Please do not move forward with this course as written. There is clear partisan, bias as well as antisemitic positions in this curriculum. There are serious flaws and bias by the people who wrote the curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration.
