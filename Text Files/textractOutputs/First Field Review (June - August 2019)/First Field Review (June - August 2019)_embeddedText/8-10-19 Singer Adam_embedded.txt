256, 264-269 - Single sided view and no historical context from the israeli perspective
242 - Does not offer or give an account of how many previous peace deals that were on the table. Also does not note who and why those peace deals were never taken. The `why', especially around arab or islamic supremacy that exists in the middle east. Also ignores the amount of racism that Jewish people have endured prior to 1948 in the middle east. No mention of how Jewish people fled existing middle easterner arab or islamic supremacy countries.
"Israel-Palestine" is not the correct phrase to use, Israel is a country, Palestine is a contested region or people. Israel is not an Arab country and shouldn't be implied as such.
234 - false equivalence to what is happening in the US to what is happening and has happened in Israel. Also, if the text wanted to be clear, it could easily number and explain the terrorists activities and incidents that lead to the wall. Also could attempt at introspection why Jewish people would be concerned with direct hate of their peoples from the Arab and Islamic world, that has been around and clearly documented hundreds of years before the establishment of Israel as a state.

Does not give an unbiased view on the harm of BDS, also does not give a positive view on the economic and innovative impact Israel has had on the world. Instead it takes the position of tactics used. Also the side effects of the BSD movement should be recognized and explained, such as increased anti-semitism on collage campuses, leading some schools to ban it, such as Davis. The motivation of BDS is one thing, the effect and promotion of hate it brings is another. None of that is highlighted. It could also be highlighted how a non-violent movement, while in name, try to promote a non-violent approach, but how lead to violence and hate.
I feel the authors of this document, while good meaning, probably don't take the effort to view multiple layers deep. They have not taken the time to deeply understand the history that has lead up to the current situations of Jewish people in the world. Makes no note to explain how oppression works in other countries, especially non-white countries. While the topics being explained are current events, they don't provide a rich introspection and diverse viewpoint, not to promote which viewpoint is right or wrong, but to give the student the ability to think through the situations at hand. This document ignore oppression of Jewish people in almost all countries where major, world changing, oppression happened, Middle East, Soviet Union, Europe and the United States. Reading books or research similar to data explained in https://www.amazon.com/Inheriting-City-Children-ImmigrantsCome "Inheriting the City: The Children of Immigrants Come of Age", probably would be good to highlight the success, especially if we are discussing how these groups are oppressed and concern that oppression. A core issue with these kinds of curriculums is they don't highlight success regardless of government intervention. It should highlight what people do to succeed and beat oppression at a personal level, what did they do to improve themselves vs what did a state do. What motivations and drives did the individual have to convince and influence others, did they live by those same rules, did they have grit, where did they fail.
