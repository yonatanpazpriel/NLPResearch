The list of "power structures and forms of oppression" does not mention antiSemitism Page 234, lines 4956, 4957, 4958
"Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter" � this links Palestine with Black interests, creating enmity against Israel among Blacks. Palestine is a political matter not related to American ethnic studies

"Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico" � this equates Israel's border situation with that of Mexico, aligning Mexican-Americans against Israel in a false equating of the two border situations. Page 242, line 5159, 5160
The reference to the Naqba (Catastrophe) biases the discussion toward the Palestinian view of what Israelis refer to as their "War of Independence"

The reference to "dispersal and dispossession" as a result of the creation of the State of Israel biases the discussion against Israel. Page 263, line 5656 "In Palestine, kids can't shop at these malls"
Page 268, line 5792 "I love you Free Palestine"

Page 268-9, line 5802-3 "For every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded. For each greeting, a thousand houses were demolished. They use the press so they can manufacture"

Page 269, line 5820-1 "The child Mary doesn't want your punishment, she is going to free the Palestinian soil"

Glossary and Andrea Smith Bibliography

These lyrics express political opinions and sentiments that bias attitudes against Israel and have nothing to do with ethnic studies in America The definition of BDS includes the phrase "Palestinians living under apartheid conditions," which mischaracterizes, prejudges, and oversimplifies the situation in Israel. The entire issue of BDS does not belong in a curriculum about ethnic studies in America.
