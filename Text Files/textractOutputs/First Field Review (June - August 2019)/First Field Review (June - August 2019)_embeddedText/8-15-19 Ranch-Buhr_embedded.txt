At San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) we believe deeply in the rights of all students to receive a high quality education grounded in our core values of equity and inclusion. We support AB331 that calls for Ethnic Studies as graduation requirement and AB2016 which calls for the development of an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. In fact, one of our Ethnic Studies teachers was a member of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee (ESMCAC) and another teacher was a contributor. While we appreciate the efforts of the Committee on this first draft of the model curriculum, we strongly suggest revisions to include expanded references to antisemitism and Islamophobia, as well as accurate representations of the Jewish American experience. We are especially concerned about the issues raised by our partners at the Anti-Defamation League and urge you to seriously consider their perspective.
On the next round of revisions, we strongly encourage the California Department of Education (CDE) and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to reconvene the members of the ESMCAC and to invite additional members who can provide perspectives on the Jewish American experience and antisemitism, and additional experts who can provide perspective on the rise of Islamophobia.
In SDUSD, like other districts throughout California, we have been working to develop Ethnic Studies courses. We understand the challenges of fairly and accurately representing our diverse population in our ethnic studies coursework. In an effort to invite multiple perspectives and to support the development of our courses, we use the Social Justice Standards from Teaching Tolerance (https://www.tolerance.org/frameworks/social-justice-standards) and we have partnered with organizations such as Facing History and Ourselves (https://www.facinghistory.org/) to support professional development with our staff. We also have an Ethnic Studies Advisory Committee composed of teachers, university professors, parents, students, and community members who each bring their unique perspectives to the work and help us to shape our annual goals for our Ethnic Studies program in SDUSD.
We believe that our democracy will be made stronger by providing our students with Ethnic Studies coursework that will prepare them with the knowledge and skills necessary to navigate our increasingly diverse society. At SDUSD we will continue to strive to create Ethnic Studies courses that accurately represent the diversity of our students, our state, and our nation and we are prepared to share our experiences, knowledge and expertise with others so that all students may benefit. We encourage the CDE and the IQC to move forward with revisions to the model curriculum and to continue on the path to providing all students with high quality Ethnic Studies courses.
