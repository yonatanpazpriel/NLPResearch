From: Sam Bierstock Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:36 AM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Pending Bill AB331
My attention was recently called to a proposed model ethnic studies curriculum that includes anti-Semitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel that would impact all California public high schools if Bill AB331 is approved.
You responsibility is to assure that this DOES NOT happen. We are in an age of manipulation of history and denial of historical fact to suit political agendas ï¿½ and you MUST exercise your authority to assure thatthis trend is stopped.
