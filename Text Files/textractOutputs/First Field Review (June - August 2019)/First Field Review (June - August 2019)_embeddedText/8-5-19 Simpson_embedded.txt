PAGE 13 of 26 Line #s 306-308 Content comparing White Supremacy to Capitalism
I find the correlation between white supremacy and capitalism in the current form to be completely offensive and misleading.
As a former CVUSD high school teacher, parent, and proponent of a free market, I absolutely support the intent and effort being made to enhance ethnic studies within our curriculum. The positive impact on student outcomes is proven. However, I find it sickening that our state's educational leaders have now gone so far as to lump capitalism into the same construct as white supremacy. If our public education system is going to make such a strong stand to paint capitalism as an evil twin of white supremacy, then I hope our elected officials, tax payers and parents will speak up about making sure equal consideration in the classroom is devoted to educating students regarding the oppressive impact of socialism, communism, and other systems of power that have impacted the lives of the children in the classroom. Many of our California students have come to the United States to flee social injustice, hopelessness and violence invoked by systems of power and capitalism was not the root cause.

Developing critical thinkers and creating an environment for students to be able to compete in a global society requires a commitment from our educational institution to provide diverse perspectives and facts without political bias. Making sure that students understand multiple sides of crucial concepts and social constructs should be the objective for educators at all levels. The point of ethnic studies to provide students an opportunity to draw from ancestral roots and imagine solutions where many worlds can fit together for future generations.
