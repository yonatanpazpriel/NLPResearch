From: Wendell Walton Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Cc: Kenneth McDonald; senator.rubio; assemblymember.rubio Subject: Ethnic Studies Public Comment
I am currently the Chief Learning Officer for a company in California, with 20 years experience in designing course curriculum. As a parent with children in the CA educational system, I am very concerned with the direction of the ethnic studies suggested curriculum.
In whole, the curriculum does not represent the values I want my children to be exposed to. I do support the strength of diversity, in fact, I wrote a course on it for over 300,000 employees nation-wide; however, for example, when we redefine the word "history" as "herstory" or "hxrstory", this is simply nonsensical and opens a pandora's box of ideological concepts promoted within the pages reviewed; not appropriate in my opinion for any child less than college age, who lack the foundation to adequately evaluate the material presented.
I also found the content highly politicized and slanted to the far left of center, unbalanced in its viewpoint.
I don't know many parents who have the time to wade through over 300 pages of suggested content, let alone be able to adequately research the topics presented. I give a few examples of questionable content below, but given the tenure and heavy slant toward far left ideologies, I wholeheartedly recommend rejecting the entire proposed ethnic studies curriculum in its current form in favor of a more balanced perspective.
