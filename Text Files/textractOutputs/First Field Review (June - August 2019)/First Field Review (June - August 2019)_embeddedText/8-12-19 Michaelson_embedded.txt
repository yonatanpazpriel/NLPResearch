Dear Chairperson Chao and members of the instructional quality commission:
I am writing to share my innermost response about the Ethnic Studies Program in relation to the portrayal of American Jews.
I understand it has a specific reason in terms of increasing children's comprehension for diversity - I deeply am concerned about American Jews and particularly California Jews because it is a intense disservice to them.
This will translate into a disservice to adults eventually as well.
The image this program will produce in an educational program is no more just than speaking of the control by Islamic agents in continuing terrorism and murder abroad as well as at home.
For the program to be just it needs to be about background, religious beliefs, moral and cultural values of all groups. It absolutely should not be about political purposes of adults and influencing young minds and prejudice and opinions of a few politically oriented leaders.
Your attention to the above is appreciated. Professor Mike Michaelson
