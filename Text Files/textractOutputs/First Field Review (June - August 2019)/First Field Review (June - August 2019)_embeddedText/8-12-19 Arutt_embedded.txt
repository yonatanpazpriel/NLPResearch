Cheryl Arutt, PsyD Clinical and Forensic Psychologist currently in private practice

As a psychologist and educator who taught Intercultural/Diversity courses at the Doctoral level at CSPP-LA and who holds a BA from UCLA in Gender Studies, I commend the effort to begin teaching ethnic studies. However, a course such as this must include anti-bigotry and social justice for Jews as well as other marginalized groups.

By conspicuously omitting anti-Semitism and appearing to take sides in a way that fails to acknowledge the Jewish experience, this curriculum fails to achieve the anti-bigotry and anti-hatred goals it purports to endorse. In fact, my concern is that the curriculum, as it stands, will tacitly or overtly be taken to endorse antiSemitism, even as it attempts to identify hate groups, hate crimes and intolerance against other groups of people. This is unacceptable.

Please bring in some consultants to help address these major issues with your curriculum, perhaps from the Wiesenthal Center? to assist with the necessary changes before adopting the Ethnic Studies program. Thank you for hearing my concerns. We do not wish to further inflame "isms" as we try to solve these important problems and educate our children to appreciate and respect differences.
