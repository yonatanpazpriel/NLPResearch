I am extrememly concerned with the ESMC curriculum that is being proposed . There is serious danger that this poorly written curriculum, excluding the subject of antisemitism, will exacerbate an increasing threat to the Jewish community in CA. which has been growing at an alarming rate. The entire curriculum should be rewritten and refocused so that it addresses the diversity in our state. It is very distressing to see what is being promoted as 'model curriculum.' We cannot accept, nor should our representatives accept, this seriously inadequate and potentially dangerous, attempt at addressing a serious issue that affects all residents in California. Thankyou T. Reitman
