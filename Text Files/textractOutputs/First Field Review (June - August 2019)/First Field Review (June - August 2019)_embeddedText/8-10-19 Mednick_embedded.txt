The documents are anti-Semitic. You present "Palestine" as if it were an independent nation, which it never has been. The people who fraudulently call themselves "Palestinians" cannot even pronounce that word since Arabic has no letter that makes the "p" sound. The BDS movement is a fraud. The purpose is not to "free" a captured people but rather to destroy Israel, the only democracy in the Near East (or Middle East, if you prefer). The document was written by an enemy of Israel and an enemy of the Jewish people. Israel is the only independent country that has ever existed in that area. "Palestine" was a name the Romans gave to the area because they did not want to call it Israel or Judea. The "Palestinian people" did not exist until 1967 when the Muslims living in Israel first started to use the term. Israel is the only Jewish homeland. There are 56 Muslim nations. If the Arabs living in Israel want to live in a Muslim nation, they have many choices. The curriculum you have is teaching students to hate Jews. Please correct these errors.
