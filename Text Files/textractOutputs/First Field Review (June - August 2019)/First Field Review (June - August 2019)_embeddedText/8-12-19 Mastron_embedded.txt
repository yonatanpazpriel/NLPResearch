To Whom it May Concern: The proposed curriculum is both anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. The goal of Ethnic Studies should be to promote understanding and tolerance, not to demonize and discriminate. I urge you to reject the proposed curriculum and not allow the ethnic studies program to be hijacked by hatred. Thank you,
