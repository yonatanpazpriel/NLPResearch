Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2 - The Definition of BDS here is incomplete. The BDS National Committee (BNC) adds the goal of right of return, i.e., ending the presence of a Jewish State of Israel. This should be made clear. Page 2 � Capitalism is defined in a manner that highlights concerns, although leaving out the important context of liberal democracy as well as comparison with other kinds of societies, e.g. socialist or communist autocracies that are similarly or more virulently problematic for minorities. P 234 - It would be important, especially given overwhelming community and Congressional concern about negative impacts of BDS in promoting hate, to offer additional perspectives on BDS. On this page there is also an inaccurate equivalency of Israeli efforts to reduce violence through border control vs. US policies that seek to reduce asylum seeking at the US-Mexico border. P 237 � Use of the term Israel-Palestine is not consistent with UN terminology, which identifies Israel as a country and Palestine in observer status.
P 242 � The narrative of Nakba is a singular one denoting one point of view and should be accompanied by other viewpoints e.g. the displacement of a similar number of Jews in Arab countries at that time.

P 25, 264-269 - It would be helpful to accompany poetry and content that is critical of Israel with writing that reflects the concerns or challenges of Israelis facing incendiary balloons with deforestation, children in shelters from rockets, etc.

With the rise of antisemitism on both the left and right in the US, more violent acts, etc. it is surprising that there is no section on this topic.
