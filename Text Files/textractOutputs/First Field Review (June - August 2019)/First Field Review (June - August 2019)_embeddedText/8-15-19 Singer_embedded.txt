Anti-Semitism is out of control. Why???
The fact that the New York Times can publish blatant anti-Semitic cartoons and still be held as a credible news source is unacceptable.
The fact that freshman US congresswomen can issue blatant anti-Semitic statements such as, "... there's always a calming feeling when I think of the holocaust..." and "...Israel has hypnotized the world; may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel..." and the reality that these women go unpunished and unrepentant, but rather protected and allowed to continue as lawmakers in this country is unacceptable.
And now.... the California Department of Education is proposing an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that, on the surface, professes to "help alleviate prejudice and bigotry", when in actuality has excluded Jewish Americans as one of the six ethnic groups covered in the curriculum, omits the term "anti-Semitism" in its glossary of terms of behaviors that display bias and hatred of other races or communities, and even singles Israel out with classic anti-Semitic stereotypes.
This is clearly an intent of ethnic cleansing of the Jewish people from the public education system, and from the new generation of children and young adults in our society.
THIS is what propagates anti-Semitism. It all works together. No matter what side of the political fence you are on, it is just not acceptable.
Leaving out excerpts of history or modifying history as they actually occurred so as not to "offend" anyone is not teaching history, it is teaching fiction.
Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, and I truly hope that this issue will be thought out thoroughly and honestly, with respect to all people.
Sincerely, Pamela Singer
