Sir:
Ethnic studies should NOT paint capitalism as an evil system. Honest exposure of other systems such as communism, socialism, etc. should be included in the classroom and other teaching venues. Capitalism is how the United States came to be a very successful country in allowing our people to excel amongst others in the world. I repeat, capitalism is NOT an evil system.
