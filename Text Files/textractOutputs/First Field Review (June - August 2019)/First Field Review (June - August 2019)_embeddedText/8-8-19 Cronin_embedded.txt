My son is a mixed race high schooler. I have pushed on him values instead of cultural sensitivity. I hate cultural pride. I am the granddaughter of Immigrants myself and our heritage was never a part of my youth. That I heard stories of hardships and discrimination of my heritage had no bearing on my outlook. Sometimes my husband's family will bring up the discrimination their group suffers. Whatever they think is their business but I want my son to not to have that chip on his shoulder. It is stifling.
My favorite high school teacher would present one side of a historical perspective. He would have everyone spellbound that a particular action taken by our country was the right course. He would then flip it to a different narrative. His approach had more impact on my way of thinking then any University Professor or Law Professor I had. Why not implement this same approach? Students should be solid independent thinkers. In law school my bumper sticker said, 'question authority.' For our children to lead the way into the 21st century, we need this more than ever.
