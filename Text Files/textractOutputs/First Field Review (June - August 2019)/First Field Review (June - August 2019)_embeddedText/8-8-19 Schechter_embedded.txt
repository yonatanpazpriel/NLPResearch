Page 2, Lines 30 � 40: BDS is a hotly contested political movement which the U.S. House of Representatives recently rejected. The ethnic studies glossary suggests that BDS is just a social movement, where in fact BDS promotes hate and division. And only including BDS in your curriculum without mentioning that Palestinians' objective is to destroy the country of Israel, is imbalanced and unfair. Page 234: Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but includes no voices critical of their perspectives � If you feel the need to educate students as to BDS (which will encourage anti-semitism and hate), at least present the reasons why we should be critical of BDS.

 Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

 Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).

 Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

The introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. And this curriculum (in particular in how it applies to Israel, will in fact have the effect of increasing bigotry, hate and racism toward Jews.
I would encourage you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
