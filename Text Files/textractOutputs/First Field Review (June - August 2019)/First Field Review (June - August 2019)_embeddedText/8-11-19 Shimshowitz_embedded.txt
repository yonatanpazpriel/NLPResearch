From: Dror Shimshowitz Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:57 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: flawed curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am extremely concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
It's extremely concerning that Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned, Anti-Semitism
has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews, and that the BDS movement is included with no balancing perspective.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Cheers, Dror Shimshowitz
