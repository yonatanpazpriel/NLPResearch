As a 6th grade teacher of students from many different backgrounds, I work my hardest to reflect my students and their lived experiences in my curriculum. As outlined in chapter 2, page 236, lines 4986-4990, teaching a history of migration in the US is important because it centers the experiences of marginalized communities. In particular, I believe it's crucial to include Arab Americans in the curriculum. Students at my school (6th-12th grade) have done tremendous work to educate non-Arab staff and students about their rich culture and backgrounds, the effects that Islamophobia has on them, and ways that staff members can support them. Including Arab American students in CA Ethnic Studies curriculum is one major way that we can show our Arab American students that their experiences are valuable.

Furthermore, including a history of migration in the US and across the world is important not just for students who have recent immigrant backgrounds, but for all students. In our increasingly globalized society and economy, I believe educators have a responsibility to teach our students through a global lens. Excluding certain groups of immigrant communities runs counter to supporting our students in becoming global citizens. For all these reasons informed by my experiences as a teacher, I wholeheartedly believe the CA Ethnic Studies curriculum must include Arab and Arab American voices.

I am a 7th grade teacher at a diverse school. For me, it is a priority that all of my students see themselves reflected in the texts and lessons they are engaging in. Therefore, it is really important to me that I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced in chapter 2, page 1, lines 17-25, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.

As teachers, it is our responsibility to expose our students to the various lived experiences of individuals whom they resonate with. I know that when I went to college and took my first Latin American Latino Studies course, I felt like I had finally been seen and heard. Thus, I strongly believe that the CA Ethnic Studies curriculum should include Arab and Arab American voices.

As a U.S. history teacher in a school with a diverse student population, I am often confronted with the difficulty of finding historical reference materials that provide a narrative that includes everyone who lives in this country. Kids deserve to see themselves reflected in the civil society in which they live. An ethnic studies course that omits reference to a part of the world with which the U.S. has active and vibrant political ties and alliances seems negligent, particularly when many California students are related by family and friendship to the people who live in that part of the world. It is also validating and heartening for students in their formative years to see positive examples of people, societies, and cultures to which they feel a connection. Therefore, I support inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the curriculum of Ethnic Studies courses in California.

I am excited for students of color to have the opportunity to see themselves in literature, textbooks, and in their education. I believe it is important for young scholars to feel a sense of belonging in their schools and to feel validation, and teaching this curriculum may increase the likelihood of this. Therefore, I support the objectives listed in chapter 2, on page 233, lines 4921 � 4931, which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.

Including a history of migration to the US (chapter 2, page 236, lines 4986 4990) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.

As a first generation high school and college graduate from the University of California Berkeley, it is pivotal to recognize and acknowledge the powerful communities in our country that have contributed to the growth of a larger network. I am now a full-time college advisor at my former high school, trying to provide skills for students to bridge the achievement gap and break institutional barriers. The current political climate in the United States endangers the welfare of a holistic education because of hateful rhetoric used when addressing underrepresented minority communities. Celebrating the stories of these communities also allows for research to be disaggregated, meaning contextualizing data beyond `ethnic groups' to be checked off. The reality of the makeup of every state across the nation should not be diminished by a singular set of historical reports it should be inclusive of the constantly changing and evolving history of the United States.

Higher education institutions address these topics, and a high school curriculum should go beyond what is considered `core subjects'. A high school education should provide scholars a base education that not only acknowledges history but also brings to light the reality of the global majority.
