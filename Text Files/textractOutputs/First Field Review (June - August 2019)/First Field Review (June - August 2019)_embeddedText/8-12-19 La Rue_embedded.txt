From: Scarlet La Rue Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 3:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Please strongly consider eliminating the proposed high school Ethnic Studies curriculum, which is rift with bigotry and mis-information. Judaism is a religion. Jews comprise an ethnic group that dates back thousands of years. Israelis are people who live in Israel; they're not all Jewish. Many if not most Jews don't support the current political policies of the Israeli government. Most Jews support a "two state solution", but of course that has nothing at all to do with Ethnic Studies. To be useful to our students, Ethnic Studies should include the history of the peoples who reside in our country. So, a study of the native tribes, the first European Americans, Africans who were brought from the Caribbean and Africa as enslaved people, later immigrants from Germany, Ireland, Poland, Sweden, Norway, Italy, China, Japan, the Philippines, Mexico, Central and South America, and everywhere else and yes, Jews who came to escape the Spanish Inquisition and later generations, many of whom came to escape pogroms in Eastern Europe and then the Holocaust. Why did the people who came by choice come here--what drove them out of their native lands? What dangers and obstacles did they face, including the prejudice they met when they arrived? The study of these questions could underscore to our students our common humanity. And I hope that that's the underlying purpose of the course; surely it's not intended to add yet more divisive and incorrect rhetoric to our national speech. Thank you for your consideration-- Scarlet La Rue, M.D.
