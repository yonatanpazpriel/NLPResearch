I am concerned about comparisons between border policies concerning Palestine and Mexico. This Comparative Border study may seek to draw unfair comparisons not based on history and fact. Many times the complex story of the founding of Israel and the many wars that followed can be over simplified by groups attempting to make certain political points for their own purposes without including the context vital to a students full understanding of the events surrounding the founding of the state of Israel including the importance of Israel as a haven for Jews who had just lived through the Holocaust. I would recommend that a panel of well qualified historians without political biases revisit the language surrounding Israel in its entirety.
