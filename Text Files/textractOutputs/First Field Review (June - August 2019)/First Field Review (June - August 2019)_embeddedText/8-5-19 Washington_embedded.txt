[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] Page 1 line 22 � Where are the inclusion of white ethnicities?

Page 2 line 37&40 � Diversity isn't a strength, this has been proven with studies, so I'm interested in how you plan to have teachers `show students' said lie. Dismantle white supremacy? What about black supremacy? Latino supremacy? This is shaping up to be an anti-white racist course, not an "ethnic studies" course.

Page 4 line 87 � Nice, more anti-white teaching. Only white supremacy is racist, I guess.

Page 26 lines 504, 509, 515, 521, 526 � Out of the five examples the only two rich children are white. Noticing a trend yet?

Page 27 line 532 � How is shaming children about their backgrounds supposed to teach history?

Page 118 (no lines) � "Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close" Do I really have to say why this is wrong and racist?
