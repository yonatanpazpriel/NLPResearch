From: Jennifer Currah Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 12:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC proposal
As a grandparent of 2 CA high school students I am deeply concerned at the plans of board members of ESMC teaching and promoting anti Jewish and anti semitic hatred. There is no place in public school to force students to hear and learn such feelings. We ask you please to cancel such ideas being taught to our young people. Jennifer
