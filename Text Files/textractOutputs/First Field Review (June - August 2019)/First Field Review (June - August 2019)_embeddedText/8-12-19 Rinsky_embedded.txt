Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,

I am disappointed by the proposed very unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, at least in middle school, if not elementary school, but urge you to make major revisions, or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I am personally well to the left, and consider myself no fan of unlimited capitalism. Nonetheless, I was surprised that capitalism was equated with white supremacy and patriarchy.
I was even more appalled that the BDS movement was considered as a worthy "social movement", when, in fact, it singles out Israel basically on an anti Jewish basis pretending to be working for the benefit of the Palestinian people. I doubt that many of the authors of the curriculum realize that "Palestine" has never in history been a country, and that the countries which support BDS (Syria, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria), are among the most repressive, anti-democratic countries in the world.
While I support diversity and inclusion, I oppose a curriculum that ignores American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools."
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
