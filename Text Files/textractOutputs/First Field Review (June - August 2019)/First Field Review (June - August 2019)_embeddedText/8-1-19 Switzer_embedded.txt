From: Scott Switzer Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 8:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Concerning your crazy Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. You guys have completely lost your frigging minds. My kids all homeschool their children because of your whacky ideas. And we are currently looking into relocating to Utah. As far as we are all concerned, California can break off and fall into the ocean for all we care. It a shame too, as this was once a beautiful place to live....
Very sincerely,
Scott and Cheryl Switzer Santa Barbara, CA
