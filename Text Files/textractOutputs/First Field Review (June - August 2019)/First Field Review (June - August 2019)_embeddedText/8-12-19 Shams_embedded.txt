As a California resident with 3 kids in the CA public education system, I beg you to completely get rid of this insane proposal or at least make it somewhat reasonable. I was going to comment on specific sections but frankly that would take months. The whole thing should be thrown out and either revised completely or not do at all. For example, a single topic, seriously with all the injustice in countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, etc. you single out Isreal?
