From: hayasara Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:02 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Urgent
The introduction of the proposed curriculum states that "[t]he implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to...enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community or antisemitism, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a significant problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews and antisemitism from this curriculum is
deeply disappointing and educationally deficient.
BDS? Apartheid state? Media manipulators? These terms promote hatred and racism. As a retired educator, I want the children of my former students to grow up in a society that values inclusion and respect. As a grandmother, I ask you to please reconsider this curriculum model so my grandchildren can live in a fair and decent California.
Sincerely, Harriet Wolpoff
