I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ES curriculum. Including the history outline on pg 233 and 236 is essential in combatting xenophobia and discrimination of Arab communities. Palestinians in paeticular must have their history taught, and being critical of Israel and the oppression of Palestinian people is NOT the same thing as anti-Zionism. Please do not remove these sections from the curriculum.
