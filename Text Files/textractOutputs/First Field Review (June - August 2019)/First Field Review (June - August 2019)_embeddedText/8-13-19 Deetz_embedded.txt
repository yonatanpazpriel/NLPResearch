I am greatly disturbed by the lack of discussion of anti-Semitism in this proposed curriculum. Bias, discrimination, and hatred cannot be dealt with on ethnic status by status basis, but must include all groups who are victims of discrimination, violence, historical genocide. If we cannot learn from the experience of all groups we will never be able to effectively deal with the many manifestations of discrimination. The fact that the committee didn't include a thorough and historic discussion of anti-Semitism indicates either a profound ignorance of past and contemporary history or an inherent bias in the committee members, either of which should automatically disqualify those members. I am all for the inclusive discussion of ethnic issues, but the biasing of the curriculum is in absolutely contradiction of the purpose of ethnic studies. It can neither be justified on a social nor scientific basis. Incorporating personal ideological positions into a school curriculum is part of the way discrimination, hatred and racism evolves. I do not feel that the committee who has developed the proposed curriculum should be allowed to continue with the necessary revisions.
