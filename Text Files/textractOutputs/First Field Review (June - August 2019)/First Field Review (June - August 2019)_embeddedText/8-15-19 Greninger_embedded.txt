From: Bill Greninger Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:54 PM To: SBE Subject: Ethnic Studies Mandate
Linda Darling-Hammond Chairwoman, State Board of Education Sacramento, CA
Dear Ms. Darling-Hammond,
I attempted to send this letter to your office address as listed in the SBE website, but I'm not sure it was received by you. I am therefore writing an email duplicate.
I wish to comment on the article in the Los Angeles Times of August 13, 2019 concerning the ethnic studies mandate model curriculum proposed in the California Legislature.
While supporting such a curriculum, I feel it leaves out an important aspect of the problem. The times article focuses on the victims of discrimination and not on the perpetrators. although an "anti-racist curriculum", as the Times states, can aid the victims, an understanding of those engaged in and propagating racism should simultaneously be addressed. If I may use the simile: giving one aspirin is not addressing the cause of the illness.
There are reasons why others hold ethnic and racist views differing from our own, and trying to understand those reasons puts us "in their shoes" so to speak. This could facilitate a change in a student's mind set resulting in eventually understanding "where they come from" in their thinking. Such knowledge is a tool to break down the "us" vs. "them" barrier and can lead to potential constructive dialogue between antagonistic individuals and groups and help to reduce the problem. Otherwise, I feel the derogatory speech and actions will continue and perhaps grow.
Sincerely,
Bill Greninger
