I am really frustrated by the anti-Israel bias in this document and the lack of discussion of anti-Semitism is the document. It seems that this document is more of a political document than an document that should be used to shape a course for our children.
As a father of two high schoolers who have only gone to public schools I hope you manage to change this program into something that is accurate and relevant. Anti-Muslim bias is an ISSUE and should be addressed, but anti-Semitism (the shootings in Pittsburg and Poway) are clear examples of the need to address anti-Semitism in our schools. This curriculum not only does not address anti-Semitism from what I have seen, it will create more antiSemitism.
I hope reason prevails and you guys realize what is going on and you work on creating an objective curriculum that we can all be proud of.
