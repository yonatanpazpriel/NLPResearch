I am very pleased to see such a well thought out and powerful draft of model curriculum, and feel strongly this is a huge step forward for California. With this said, I am worried that there are political interests that might try and pressure the state to exclude vitally important content. For example, it is very important to include content on Boycott Divest Sanctions movement to oppose the Israeli occupation of Palestine in an ethnic studies curriculum, as these type of topics also help us better understand processes of racialization and of colonization around the world, including in our own country, the USA. I'm also concerned about outside pressures to water down this curriculum to become a more "multicultural" curriculum, which defeats the purpose of having an ETHNIC studies model curriculum. For example, attempts to include Jewish studies as part of ethnic studies, when the reality is that these areas of study (while still vital) are unique given the unique histories and complex diverse racial experiences of Jewish people. I believe this is outside the scope of the current project. I hope that CA will be able to recognize the scope of this model curriculum, and the need to ensure the inclusion of important but controversial topics like BDS into such model curriculum moving forward.
