From: Arcelia Gutierrez Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:56 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: In support of ethnic studies
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,
As a native Californian who failed to see herself reflected in K-12 course materials, I write to emphatically express my support of the institutionalization of ethnic studies. For over 50 years, communities of color have struggled to institutionalize Ethnic Studies in California. Students and faculty have advocated for the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as a legitimate academic discipline through sit-ins, rallies and strikes. Research shows when Ethnic Studies is taught, it results in narrowing and closing of the opportunity gap for students from underserved communities. We urge you not to give in to rightwing racism, xenophobia, sexism, homophobia, anti-progressivism, and anti-intellectualism that does not respect the languages, histories and cultural backgrounds of students of color. Students should be given the opportunity to study about their ancestral roots to better understand the present, and be able to imagine a brighter, more just and equitable future for California, the US, and the world. As a professor of Latino Studies, I can attest to the positive impact ethnic studies curriculum can have on all students.
Sincerely, Arcelia Guti�rrez, PhD Assistant Professor of Latino Studies Department of Hispanic Studies University of Kentucky, Lexington -Best regards, Arcelia Guti�rrez, Ph.D.
