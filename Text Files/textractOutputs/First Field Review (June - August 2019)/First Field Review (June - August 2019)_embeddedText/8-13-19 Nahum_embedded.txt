The level on anti-Semitism in this required curriculum unfortunately is similar to the engrained anti-Semitism that is taught by the Palestinian Authority. In that case it results in an endless cycle of martyrdom and suffering on both sides. I suspect in this case, it will cause a serious uptick in anti-Semitic attacks. Over time the local Jewish population will either begin to retaliate or will eventually move away. Either way would result in a disastrous outcome. It is unfortunate that time after time Jews are not considered as an `ethnic minority' but are somehow viewed as the oppressor. Considering the Jewish history (no just the horrors of the holocaust but even before) you should be ashamed of yourselves for disregarding it.
