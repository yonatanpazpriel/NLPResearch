To Whom It May Concern:
I would truly appreciate it if California would stop coming up with curriculum that destroys the core of this great nation. What we need is to go back to the basics of teaching love for our country and not rebellion. Capitalism may not be perfect, but it sure is better than Socialism. We want freedom to think and speak, and not to "guide" our students into hating our country.
