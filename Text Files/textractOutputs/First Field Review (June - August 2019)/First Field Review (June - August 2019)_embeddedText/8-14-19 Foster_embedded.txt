From: Della Foster Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ETHNIC STUDIES CURCULUM
WE WANT TO EXPRESS OUR DEEPEST OPPOSITION TO THE SUBJECT BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE. AS PARENTS WE ARE OPPOSED TO ANY CURRICULUM THAT DOES NOT ADEQUATELY PREPAARE OUR CHILDREN FOR THE WORLD IN WHICH IVE AND WE FEEL THEY ARE NOT RECEIVING THE BASIC TOOLS AT PRESENT IN THE PUBLSCHOOLS AND TO INTRODUCE A NEW SUBJECT COMPLETELY UNRELATED TO EDUCATION, IS ABSURB. WHO I RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SUBJECT AND WHO IS THE PUBISHER OF THE MATERIAL. WHAT ETHNIC QUALIFY FOR THIS SUBJECT AND WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR THOSE ADVOCATIONG IT? OUR INFORMATION INDICATES IT INTRODUCES AND ENCOURAGES ABERRANT BEHAVIOR AND WE DON'T WANT OUR CHILDREN EXPOSED TO ANY MORE OF THAT ESPECIALY IN LIEU OF THE IMPORTANT SUBJECTS THAT WILL INFORM THEM OF WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD, LIKE READING, WRITING AND ARITHMATIC, NOT TO MENTION THE FOUNDING FATHERS WHO GAVE US THE BILL OF RIFGHTS AND OUR UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. WE ARE IN COMPLETE AGREEMENT WITH THE TEACHER WITH TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE WHO HAD REVIEWED THE MATERIAL AND SPOKE BEFORE YOUR COMMITTEE AND WAS OPPOSED TO IT. THANK YOU. RONALD & DELLA FOSTER
