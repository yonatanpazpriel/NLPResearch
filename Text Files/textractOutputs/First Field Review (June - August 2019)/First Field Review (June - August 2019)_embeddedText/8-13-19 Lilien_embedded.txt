To whom it may concern:
Attached please find my completed public input template on the above-referenced matter.
In summary, the draft curriculum fails to meet the goals of the ESMC authorizing statute, AB2016, specifically, to "prepare pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."
The proposed curriculum fails for its hostility to both the American Jewish experience as well as to the presentation of the state of Israel. The draft excludes Jews and their American history. It neglects anti-Semitism by definition or discussion. Hatred of Jews; anti-Semitism leads hate crimes and incidents against religious groups in California (in our schools and communities) as well as across the nation. But the proposed curriculum includes rote anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Jewish stereotypes. This is no way to teach ethnic studies to our students. Remember, our students will hold our future in their hands. Teach them well.
As AB 2016 sets out: "the state's educational standards should be guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness and universally high expectations." I urge you to meet this standard by including Jewish culture and history, teaching about anti-Semitism, and avoiding irrelevant and inflammatory polemics related to Israel.
You can do better. You must do better for our students and our future.
Very truly yours,
