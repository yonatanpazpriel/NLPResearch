To whom it may concern,
I was appalled when I read the description of what you were looking to teach our High School students. It seems like you are looking at the result and not the cause. Nobody will argue that the Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza suffer hardships. But whose fault is that? That is what happens when thousands of their people wake up everyday devising of ways to kill Israeli Jews in the name of religion and terrorism. As a result, innocent Israelis and Palestinians suffer. But lifting up the suffering of Palestinians as a sign of oppression is ignorant and misses the true reality of what has caused suffering to both peoples, which is Hamas, Islamic Jihad and all their supporters among the Palestinian population. Despite what Israel faces each day, they have offered very generous peace proposals over the years only to be responded to with terrorism in the name of religion. How can you possibly have anything good to say about boycotting Israel (the goal of BDS) where Arabs are more free than anywhere in the Middle East? Where Arabs serve in the Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) and serve on the Supreme Court? From the time the United Nations voted to make Israel a country Israel has against all odds built a thriving society in a desert that is doing great things for the world. To think that they do not want peace is ignorant. And to think that the Palestinians, who celebrate by giving out candy when one of their own blows themselves up and kills innocent Jews, want peace is equally ignorant It seems like this curriculum was the vision of hateful and ignorant people who have extremist political views. Such extremist views do not belong anywhere close to our children's classrooms. What's next? A course on how Osama Bin Laden was a freedom fighter?
