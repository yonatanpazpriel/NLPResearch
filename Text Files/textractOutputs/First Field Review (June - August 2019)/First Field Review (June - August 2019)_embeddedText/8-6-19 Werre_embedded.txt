From: Roberta Werre Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 4:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed curriculum.
Capitalism is not bad. Capitalism makes societies thrive. There's nothing like motivation, ambition, and hard work to make a nation prosper. Capitalism is the back bone of the United States. The social programs started last century by FDR were meant to be a temporary solution, not a lifestyle. A very wise president once said, "The answer to welfare is a job." Capitalism is not racist. The majority of the hard working Americans don't care about their coworkers ethnicity. We're all in this together, and capitalism has nothing to do with racism or subjugating people of color. Do not adopt the proposed curriculum. If you do, parents will be removing their students in droves, leaving a vacant and bankrupt public school system. Sincerely, Roberta Werre
