From: Rabbi Menachem Levine Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 3:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: 'Rabbi Menachem Levine' Subject: Anti-Semitism in California Public Schools Importance: High
Dear Sir/Madam,
As a rabbi of hundreds of San Jose, California and a community leader who works with many leaders in Silicon Valley. I am attaching my comments about the implementation of your proposed Ethnic Studies in California's public schools.
The proposed curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
On the contrary, it only spreads anti-Semitism and ignores the Jewish Community.
I spoke about this in San Jose's City Hall earlier this year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp-TYjJ684&list=PLNbjj-Ol2Nd8JaJZHgkmXixyl1pL2mi9t
If you implement this horrific curriculum I WILL join others in publicizing locally and nationally your propaganda.
Sincerely,
Rabbi Menachem Levine Congregation Am Echad

Promotes hate and division.
You shoud add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Personally, as a grandson of four Holocaust survivors who has spoken in California public schools. I am horrified by the direction of your curriculum. Both the BDS aspect as well as what you leave out.
