From: dganit drori Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:27 AM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Safety concern due to the New Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Kenneth McDonald,
My name is Dganit Drori and I live in San Marcos,CA. Next week my daughter is going to start high school and we are very concern to her safety after hearing and reading the new proposed program. We are Americans-Israelis-Jewish from families who were hunted and deported from Egypt and Yaman. Our Jewish history proved so many times that disasters start to happen with small bad acts and ideas warped in human, positive warp, and if we will not stand together to stop the spread of this acts and ideas, it can easily happen again. Hate crime against Jewish, Israelis are already happening all the time around us.
This letter is to confirm that I added my signature to the Israel-American Community's official complaint, and have submitted this complaint on my behalf.
The proposed coursework, as written, will turn California classrooms into discriminatory and hostile environments for the young people in our community. This curriculum endorses prejudice against Jewish, IsraeliAmerican and Zionist students, and delegitimizes their heritage and identity. It will lead to harassment, bullying, and discrimination.
This deeply biased curriculum has no place in our public schools, which should be forums for teaching respectful dialogue, understanding, and tolerance.
I ask that you respectfully consider putting a hold on the currently proposed curriculum, and meet our community leaders to discuss how to improve this deeply biased coursework, which would create a hostile environment for Israeli-American and Jewish-American students.

Thank you Dganit Drori
