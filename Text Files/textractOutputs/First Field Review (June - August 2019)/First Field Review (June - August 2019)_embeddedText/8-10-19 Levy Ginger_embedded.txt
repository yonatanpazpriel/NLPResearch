Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:
I am concerned and troubled by the proposal to adopt such a flawed, inaccurate and ahistorical Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, as it is an important part of our educational system. That said, I strongly urge you to significantly revise or rewrite the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter.
Among the important aspects of an ethnic studies curriculum is that it be inclusive and not demonize any group. By excluding the Jewish experience as well as antisemitism you are affirmatively choosing to not be inclusive. By including a song that includes offensive tropes about Jews, the curriculum specifically singles out Jews for demonization.
This is especially troubling in light of major events and trends in US and world history as well as more recent events. These, of course, include:
 the long history of pogroms in places such as Russia
 the Holocaust (where, 20 million were killed, including 6 million Jews, who were targeted solely because they were Jewish)
 US immigration law changes in the 1920s in reaction to high levels of immigration by Jews and others who were not Northern European Protestants
 the mid/late 20th century expulsion of Jews from the Arab world, where they had lived for centuries
 Father Coughlin and his ilk in the 20th Century, preaching hatred including Antisemitism

 The history of restrictive deeds and other measures in zoning in many American to exclude Jews
 Antisemitism expressed from the White House, as evidenced by the Nixon tapes
 the recent spike in antiemetic incidents in the US (including Pittsburgh and Poway, in our very own state, where murderers were targeted at Jews) and anti-Semitic attacks in France
 recent surveys in the US, which show that Anti-semitism is deeper and more broadly held than appears on the surface. I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Ginger Levy
