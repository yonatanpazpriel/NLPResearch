From: Susan Dressler Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 2:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Proposal
I commend the effort to better educate students about bias and misunderstanding about ethnic groups. However, I am very upset with the omission of Anti-Semitism in this proposal. Anti-Semitic hate crimes are at an all time high in California and in the USA and there is no mention of this group. Why? Is this a deliberate omission while the proposed curriculum includes information on a boycott of Israel? Is this proposed curriculum intentionally anti-semitic?
I urge you to go back to the drawing board and make a major revision in this proposal. Anti-Semitism must be included. Susan Dressler, Ed.D.
