From: Robin Fox Avedesian Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Hello,
It has come to my attention that the proposed ethnic studies curriculum does not include language addressing anti-Semitism even though other forms of bias are addressed. In addition, it does not acknowledge that the Jewish people as one of the many ethnic groups within our state. Also, any language supporting anti-Semitic sanctions or anti-Jewish stereotypes has no place in a curriculum.
Thank you,
Robin Avedesian
