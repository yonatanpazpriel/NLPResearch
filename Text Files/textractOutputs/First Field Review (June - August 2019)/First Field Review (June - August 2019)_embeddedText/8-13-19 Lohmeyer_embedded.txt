Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Capitalism -- which has created more wealth, personal comfort and well-being than all the other isms combined -- is equated with racism and characterized as a "form of power and oppression." Israel is singled out for special critique and condemnation and anti-Semitism is ignored.

Critical thinking is not equated with careful research, logic and discernment, but with activism and politicized direct action.

This promotes ideological indoctrination, not education.
