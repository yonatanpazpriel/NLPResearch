Seriously you are sprouting propaganda and ignoring facts, hardly educational ! Even the name Palestinian, which Arabs can't pronounce, they use a B instead of P Is lifted from Jewish history. Jews have separate language , food, land claims in Judea, customs , religion "Palestinians" speak Arabic , have same food, religion and their land claims are from the Arabian peninsula , meaning they are run of the mill Arabs, not a separate ethnicity Deal with it.
