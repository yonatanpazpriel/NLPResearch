From: Patricia Erzinger Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Assembly Bill 331
To the Ethics Study Committee,
I have read this bill and believe that it will weaken the State Educational Code by diverting considerable resources away from curriculum that helps students to learn more important subjects. Today's students understand LGBTQ and diversity much more than most adults. They are actually bombarded with this information. But many of them lack needed learning in reading, writing and math skills. Such skills are needed to obtain jobs in our changing tech economy and to just live life.
California students regularly underperform on statewide tests. This is a disgrace to California. Additional resources, if available ought to be added to more valuable classes. Bill 331 may divert money from critical STEM education.
Ethnic struggles and diversity are already included in history and social justice classes. Our youngsters need to better understand our unique rights and freedoms as Americans.
Please remove this bill from your docket.
Respectively,
