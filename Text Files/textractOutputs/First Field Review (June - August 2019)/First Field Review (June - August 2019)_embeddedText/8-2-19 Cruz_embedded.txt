Congratulations for an important educational-feat to make our educational system wholistic in learning and in the formation and educational development of our present generation of students/estudiantils throughout all School Districts for the State of California. With our Elders opening doors of higher education with a powerful and loving community-student-professors conference held at University of California at Sta. Barbara (UCSB) on April 11, 12, y 13 de 1969. This re-evolutionized how the interdisciplinary paradigm of Chicana Chicano Studies change for the betterment Social Science perspective to be more inclusive with cultural identity, scholarship-autonomy to write stories - history, herstory, and forever solidify a colorful pluralistic view in social science.
As a estudiantil/student learning all the tenets and educational genre of Chicana Chicano Studies had given me life away from a path of darkness, path of ignorance, and path of self-destruction for lack of chicano identity in our schools system. The school systems of Sta. Barbara School District did not highlight the attainment of striving to college. For the lack of books? Yes, it was a lack of learning of self, in order, to instill the self-confidence to becomes a better person and a positive contributor to our society, but especially, in the lovely City of Sta. Barbara. If it was not for ALL my maestros and my maestras than i would have been reflective of the statistical number to one person entering the school-to-jail-pipeline! It is not joke to be ignorant of self, for it causes one not to care. IF I HAD Chicana Chicano Studies on elementary 80's, jr. high school mid80's, and or high school (Class of 1991), i could have attained a couple of Doctorate Degrees already. The School Of Hard Knocks is what i was challenged with for not having any self-esteem to be postive amidst all the negative stereotypes a kid confronts from teachers who do not care of my culture and or one's identity. I was leading myself down the road of negativity until i enrolled into the EOPS program at Sta. Barbara City College and had taken my first chicano studies course with don Dr. Manuel Unzueta. His class made me change to be someone that was going to make a difference in our local community of Sta. Barbara, Califaztlan 93101-1542 I learn to love myself and educate myself with all the Teachers that are present and that have gone into spiritworld. In transferring into UCSB as a political science major and Chicana Chicano Studies major, i gain more insight to how this educational conference in April of 1969

was the beginning of something very very special from a scholastic endeavor in social science in higher education.
As a student member of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (M.E.Ch.A.)at SBCC and El Congreso de UCSB helped me to become a student leader and eventually doing acute research on all the NAMES INCLUDED hereinbelow that were the participants of this beautiful and loving conference because they paved the road and opened the doors for those yet to come. 1969-2019 is 50 years of scholar-activism-mentoring that has taken place which is powerful in terms of education.
Today, in honoring our Historia Chicana por el Movimeinto Chicano and the Original Gatekeepers of Higher Education i am the estudiantil/publisher of the EPdSB Book Volume III that was developed from this April 1969 conference. First Volume I was printed in 1969. Second Volume II was printed in 1971. And i was born in the City of Sta. Barbara in 1973. It took me mu adult life to complete the THIRD EDITION PROJECT and i would love from my entire being and humble heart have this generation of students/estudiantil in California have the opportunity to read, to decipher intellectually the contents of this EPdSB Book Volume III de 2019.
