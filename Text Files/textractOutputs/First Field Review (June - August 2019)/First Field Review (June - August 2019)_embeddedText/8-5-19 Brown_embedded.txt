Concerned parent of a boy who will be in the California School System

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am a parent of a 10.5-month old boy. He will be in the California school system. Some of the curriculum outlined below that his peers will be exposed to creates anti-Israel and anti-Semitic sentiments. I myself have been a victim to antisemitism in the past (due to people having antiIsrael viewpoints), and was hoping when I moved to California (from the Midwest) to start a family that this would be a great state for highlighting inclusion. I hoped that when I had children (& still hope now that I have a little boy) that they would be part of an inclusive society. Please reshape some of the curriculum as it directly affects my family and others like mine. The inclusion of many BDS & pro-BDS viewpoints is disheartening. The lack of opposing viewpoints is even more disheartening. Promoting hate against Israel does not foster an inclusive environment.

Also, please please please add lessons about an overlooked ethnic group, American Jews. This would include those who fled the Holocaust, Jews who fled oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. I have relatives who died in the Holocaust; I have other relatives who fled the Soviet Union. The only way to fight ignorant hatred is through education. I urge the state department to help fight hatred against American Jews, by educating students on these topics rather than highlighting anti-Israel sentiment. American Jews are very much an ethnic minority with a disproportionate amount of hate crimes against them. Antisemitism is very real, and has created fear in our community, and my family personally. Thank you, and please look at the specific sections I have noted below.

Page 2 lines 30-40�Please remove the section pertaining to BDS from the curriculum. I understand there are differing viewpoints on this issue, but the promotion of BDS and anti-Israel sentiments encourage local antisemitism. We live in a society that needs an inclusive attitude towards people of all religious, ethnic, & otherwise labeled backgrounds; the BDS movement does just the opposite, and it promotes divisiveness and hate. Page 234 lines 4956 & 4957--This section tells teachers to promote BDS and the pro-BDS group, Direct Action for Palestine. Nowhere does it provide for critical opposing viewpoints, which basically guides teachers to only promote anti-Israel sentiments.

Page 234 line 4958--This section is inappropriate as it creates an inaccurate analogy between a nation's (Israel) self-defense and efforts to stop terrorists from murdering innocent people in their communities, and how the USA creates policy with the Mexican border. This should not be a comparative study as Israel is a nation protecting its citizens from constant attacks on innocent lives, and the US border situation is based on fleeing hardship for a better life in America. Page 237 line 5030--The use of "Israel-Palestine" creates confusion that this is the name of one Arab nation.
Page 242 lines 5154 to 5163--This whole section highlights the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as a factual occurrence of events, without providing alternative perspectives. Also, during the same period, 850000 Jewish people were expelled or pushed out of surrounding Middle Eastern nations. Nowhere does the curriculum speak of the Jewish refugees. Page 256, 264-269--These pages gives a poem for teachers to use that harshly and unfairly criticizes Israel. Nowhere is there content for teachers with positive views of Israel, or content criticizing Palestinian leadership. If there is criticism of one side of the conflict, then criticism should exist for the other side as well. Also, there should be positive viewpoints of both sides. These sort of one-sided attacks prove to be dangerous and create anti-Israel sentiments that lead to antisemitism as well.
