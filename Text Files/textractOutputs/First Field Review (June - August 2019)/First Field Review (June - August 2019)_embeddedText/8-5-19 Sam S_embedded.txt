To Whom It May Concern,
Pls do not brainwash my children with the idea that capitalism is evil and racist. I have been contemplating on removing my children from public school for some time, this will push me further to make the decision.
Shame on your political agenda of indoctrinating children. YOU ARE SUPPOSE TO EDUCATE THEM, PLS REFRAIN FROM INDOCTRINATION AND BRAINWASHING.
Thank you, Sam S.
