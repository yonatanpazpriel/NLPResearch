[The glossary includes a definition of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions against Israel. It mearly parrots BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which SEEKS TO END ISRAELS EXISTANCE. I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group,, including those who fled the holocaust, oppression in the middle east and discrimination in the former soviet union. Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and US policies on the border with Mexico. It encourages teachers to hightlight BDS and PRO BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspective. It is biased.
