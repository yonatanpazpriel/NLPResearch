I have read the concerns regarding the curriculum in Calmatters and J. Weekly. I share those concerns. The curriculum should not be about indoctrinating students in a left wing agenda, e.g. condemning capitalism, supporting the BDS movement, and giving a biased perspective on Israel. The curriculum should be reviewed carefully to ensure that it factually accurate and is not designed to further a political agenda. I think it is critical for you to examine how these things even made it into the draft to begin with. Marleen Sacks
