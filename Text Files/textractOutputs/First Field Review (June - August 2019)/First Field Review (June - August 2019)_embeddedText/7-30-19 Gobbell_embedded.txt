Capitalism is described as a "form of power and oppression," alongside "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy" and "ableism." Capitalism and capitalists appear as villains several times in the document. Your definition of Capitalism is terrible. Capitalism allows people the freedom to start business, be a part of business, choose to get a job from a business, etc. You need to point out the significant benefits of capitalism and how it has contributed to our country and our world. Capitalism is, in fact, a great tool of one's own "self-determination." You reference the "Muslim Ban." The title of Executive Order 17369 is: "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States." Only its detractors refer to it as a "Muslim Ban." Can you please be fair and balanced and present both sides of the argument both here and all through the one-sided curriculum? Teachers are encouraged to cite the biographies of "potentially significant figures" such as convicted cop-killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur are also on the list. How about teaching them about Justice Clarence Thomas & Ben Carson? There is so much bias here. How about a non-liberal viewpoint from a person of color like Larry Elder? Or even a white conservative? There are many different cultures that white people are a part of as well. The Latino section's people of significance include Puerto Rican nationalist Oscar L�pez Rivera, a member of a paramilitary group that carried out more than 130 bomb attacks, and Lolita Lebr�n, who was convicted of attempted murder in a group assault that wounded five congressmen.

Teaching objective history obviously isn't the goal of this. The goal seems to be indoctrinating students to become ideological activists and proponents of identity politics. In fact, I think it really marginalizes people and divides them. We should strive to be color blind, not identify and discriminate based on their gender or skin color. BDS? Really? Anti-Jewish propaganda. You should be ashamed of yourself. Where is the Jewish rebuttal to that? You should reference someone like Dennis Prager to balance this out. And the fact that BDS propositions have been rejected in our own country. We support Israel because it is a friendly, very well-functioning country that contributes positively to the world. The Palestinians have every opportunity to be the same but have been deterred by a violent radical ideology.
