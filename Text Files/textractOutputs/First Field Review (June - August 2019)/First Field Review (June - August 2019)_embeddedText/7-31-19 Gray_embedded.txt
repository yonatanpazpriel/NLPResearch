From: Linda Gray Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 2:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies?
I am distressed to hear your curriculum is anti capitalism. Free market has proven to be the only clear way for cultures to rise out of the ash of their leaders' greed. Please study current and past socialist countries. If you think the Swedes are Socialistic, think again. They began with a robust free market that can support very high taxes. Please reconsider this `educational offering' in California. Better to study history. Sincerely Linda Gray.
