COMMENT 1: I beseech you to include lessons about another targeted American ethnic group � the Jewish People, including but not limited to, Holocaust survivors (so as not to erase history by omission), and those who successfully fled Europe, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. COMMENT 2: BDS promotes hatred, division and lack of understanding. I also urgently implore you to remove BDS (likening the situation to South Africa) and other anti-Israel
bias. The definition is factually incorrect and this is an issue that will cause unnecessary tension between parents and teachers, and among students who lack true understanding of a current political situation.

p 34 "Whiteness" in Glossary

Joann Hulkower

To label someone's skin color, as is done in the glossary when a definition is given for "whiteness" will cause tensions and hatred in classrooms beyond imagination. The child with the fair skin will likely be taunted and blamed for the color of their skin. I can't imagine that the label "blackness" would be acceptable so why would the label, "whiteness" be okay?
