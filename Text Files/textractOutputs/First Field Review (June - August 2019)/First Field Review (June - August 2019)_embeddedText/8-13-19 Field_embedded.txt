I find the proposed curriculum to be biased and unfair. What type of curriculum are you trying to teach our children. It is not fair to teach them about social movements against people. Teach them to love each other. They can learn about social movements on their own. This is a ridiculous piece of anti Jewish, anti white material. How dare you propose such a piece of learning material for our children. You should be ashamed with all the killings and hate that exists in our country.
