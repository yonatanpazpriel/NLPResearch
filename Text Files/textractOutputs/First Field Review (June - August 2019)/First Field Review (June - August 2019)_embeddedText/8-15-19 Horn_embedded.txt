Hi: The new ethnic studies program sounds wonderful, but please include the Jews and anti-semitism in that program. I love the idea of the program, but Jews and anti-semitism being excluded makes no sense. How can it be excluded when it is so topical today and has been for a very, very long time Kids need to hear the truth to help combat hate. Thank you, Lynne Horn
