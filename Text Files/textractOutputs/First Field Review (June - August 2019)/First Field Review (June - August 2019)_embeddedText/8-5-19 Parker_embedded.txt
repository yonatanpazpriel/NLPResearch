Page 2, Lines 30-40. Please remove the content on BDS. Given the curriculum strives to be inclusive, Israel should not be singled out and vilified. While some may object to the Israeli government's stance on certain issues, this is not the approach for a constructive solution. This language instead promotes anti-Israel bias, which also feeds the growing strain of anti-Semitism in the U.S. Page 237, Line 4972. Please remove the content on BDS.

Page 256, 264-269. These poems and lyrics promote bias and divisiveness through unfettered criticism of Israel with no positive perspectives on Israel or constructive criticism of Palestinians. Given the goal of teaching students to think critically, it is imperative that they be presented with a range of views so that they question and deeply understand. In an effort to broaden students' views of the world and to be inclusive, we must avoid promoting narrow perspectives that perpetuate bias and limit students' opportunity to understand the complexities of society and history. Anti-Semitism is a growing threat and we do not want a curriculum that promotes this vile trend, particularly when the objective is to aid "in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." To promote an inclusive curriculum, please include lessons on the Jewish community, including the horrors of the Holocaust and the persecution of Jews in the former Soviet Union and elsewhere. We as a society do not want any group to be persecuted or marginalized, and this includes Jews, who continue to be targeted through anti-Semitic words and actions.
