From: D Ska Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 1:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment - 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
Mr. McDonald and the the California Department of Education and Instructional Quality Commission ,
During the comment period - attached are my comments regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum proposed revisions for the 2020 year. I am a resident of the state, a parent of 3 school-age children, an immigrant from the Soviet Union, a Jew, and a citizen of the USA. I am very upset about some of proposed curriculum revisions because I believe they are unbalanced with respect to Jews as an ethnic group, draw the wrong moral equivalence between illegal immigration and Palestinians, and fail to teach a more balanced view of ethnic history.
More specifically I am opposed to any reference to BDS in the curriculum and the one sided vilification of the State of Israel. It is a false narrative, promoted by false prophets and terrorists to achieve a false view of history - it is also wrong. Please consider my comments,
