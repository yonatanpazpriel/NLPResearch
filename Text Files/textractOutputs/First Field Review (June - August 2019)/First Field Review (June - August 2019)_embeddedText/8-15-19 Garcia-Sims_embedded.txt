Ethnic Studies makes learning real to students, grabs their guts and hearts and inspires them to strive to learn, to become more efficacious. Racial animus in the Arizona state government led to the banning of the Tucson Unified School District Ethnic Studies. Research paid for by the state and conducted by qualified out-of-state researchers confirmed that the program had a profoundly desirable effect on students taking the course. "Ethnic" students who previously felt marginalized by the standard mostly Eurocentric curriculum begin to learn their own and their family's place in the country, and develop an informed passion for learning. I saw some of this when I evaluated bilingual programs throughout California and communicated with other educators and researchers throughout the country. We can no longer afford to keep turning out mediocre students to become low level workers. Ethnic Studies programs can inform and inspire students who previously might have slid through public and charter schools to take charge of their own learning and become more contributing or connected citizens of our world. Having such a program will enable educators committed to their own community to connect their students to the larger society, understand how they are a part of the whole and must contribute to the benefit of the whole society. Otherwise, Youtube and ethnic variations of 8chan may seduce those who have never learned their own history, their own culture and how they are an integral part of the whole. We will all benefit from ethnic studies in all public schools. Support Ethnic Studies!
