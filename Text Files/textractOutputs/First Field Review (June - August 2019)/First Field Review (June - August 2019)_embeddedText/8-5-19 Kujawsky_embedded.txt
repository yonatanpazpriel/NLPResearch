This model curriculum betrays a pronounced anti-Israel bias. Most Jewish students have a positive relationship with the Jewish State. As a result, this curriculum violates its own guidelines (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/ethnicguidelines.asp), which include: "Be inclusive, creating space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, or citizenship, to learn different perspectives." (Emphasis added.) Page 2: The definition of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is one-sided and tendentious, masking the intent of the BDS movement's founders to destroy Israel. The apartheid charge is false. This narrative ignores the Palestinians' share of responsibility for a complex problem with no simple solutions. Page 234: Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering the country to murder Jews cannot reasonably be compared with U.S. efforts to enforce its immigration laws.

Page 242: The events of 1948 in Israel/Palestine are not just a "Naqba" for the Palestinians. It is also Israel's War of Independence, giving the Jewish people freedom from oppression and sovereignty in its historic homeland for the first time in nineteen hundred years. Giving students only the Palestinian perspective is propaganda, not education.

There is not a single lesson devoted to the American Jewish community, despite its long history in this country, its manifold achievements and contributions, its participation in the Civil Rights Movement and other movements that have improved America, and the positive example it gives of a discriminated-against minority that has nevertheless become successful and integrated into American society. This erasure of the Jews in America is unconscionable. It appears that this ethnic studies curriculum is intended to propagate a political orthodoxy, rather than inculcate critical thinking. If so, better that it not be taught at all.
