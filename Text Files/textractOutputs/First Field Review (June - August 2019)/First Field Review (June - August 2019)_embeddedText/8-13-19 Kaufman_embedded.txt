From: Dylan Kaufman Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 6:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please Include Anti-Semitism into the ESMC Model Curriculum before approving it.
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I live in California and care a lot about educating our youth about diversity and inclusion of all types. I am writing to comment on your proposed ESMC proposed curriculum and I oppose it as written today because it fails to discuss antisemitism. I'm very concerned about the proposed curriculum which reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism. As it stands today I believe this curriculum would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools. ï¿½ This is wrong, and unacceptable.
I urge you to make major revisions or complete a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others who are also calling for this change. It needs to include Anti-Semitism and discuss the long time persecution of Jews that continues today.
I'm Jewish and I have friends & family who are Jewish and in today's climate of hate in this country, Anti-Semitism is at the top of the list for hate crimes and I can't believe that you are not including it in your proposed curriculum and that you are actually including some Anti-Semitic Tropes that will be teaching the next generation to wrongly hate Jews (and Israel). This is NOT inclusive and is not right.
Please do not approve this curriculum as it stands. I expect you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Dylan Kaufman Berkeley
