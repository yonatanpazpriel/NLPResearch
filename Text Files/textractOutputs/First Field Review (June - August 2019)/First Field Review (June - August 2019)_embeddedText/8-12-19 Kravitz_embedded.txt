From: Richard Kravitz Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:26 AM To: CFIRD Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear Curricular Frameworks and Instructional Resources Division:
Due to concerns about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for potential anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content, I would urge you to prevent establish robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
My work with University of California students brings home how vulnerable these students are to various forms of disinformation and indoctrination, on a variety of topics. It is important that curricular standards be established to minimize unintended harmful consequences such as inciting hate.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Sincerely,
Richard L. Kravitz, MD, MSPH Professor, Division of General Medicine Director, UC Center Sacramento
