General: This model presents extremely biased points of view without offering or even allowing considerations for alternative thinking. It promotes an ideology that has potential to compromise promotion of a healthy life-style from a physiological scientific standpoint. The extensive glossary of terms "redefines" words using a biased ideological worldview. The general sense of the model is to promote ideology, not to provide guidelines that promote a healthy basis for educational inquiry. This model should be categorically rejected and reconstructed with a model that would promote a healthy educational experience.
