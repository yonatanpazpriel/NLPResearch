Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable) My comments are general in nature. While I'll believe the intent of the legislation
signed by the governor is honorable, the execution of this draft is less than honorable. This is clearly a very one-sided political document. It has no place in
our public schools. I recommend going back to "Square One". Make sure the committee members have a broad spectrum of ideas and thoughts. This
document as written and any final document emanating from this draft, should never see the light of day.
