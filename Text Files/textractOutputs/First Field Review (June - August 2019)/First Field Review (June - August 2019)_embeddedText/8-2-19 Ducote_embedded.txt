From: Gail Ducote Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 11:45 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on the proposed curriculum
California Education Department,
Firstly, thank you for being open to the comments of your community. The education of our children is extremely important for everyone not just those with school age children. The proposed requirement to teach ethnic studies to young children should be met because it is state mandated, however it should be based on an analytical approach. I am concerned that it will be a reactive message for some and be used as a form of propaganda messaging. The way the proposal is currently written is misleading and a one sided point of view. This then becomes a propaganda driven agenda taught to our most vulnerable community members. This is not public education - it's the political strategy of those in power and control.
Please reconsider the messaging you are sending our school children to include a balanced understanding of cultural events and the historical background it reflects.
Sincerely,
Gail Ducote
