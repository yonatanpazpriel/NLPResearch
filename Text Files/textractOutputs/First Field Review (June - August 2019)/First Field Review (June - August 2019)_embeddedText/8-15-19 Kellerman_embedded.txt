I have heard that you are going to revise your 2020 model curriculum and I applaud that decision. I hope that your new curriculum will include the Jewish people as an ethnic minority rather than promoting the current myth that Jews are rich imperialists who control everything, and other antisemetic ideas. Jews have been discriminated against throughout history and despite that have contributed a lot to American culture and world culture. I hope that you will recognize antisemitism and teach the holocaust and that you will not promote the BDS movement - are you going to promote boycotting China for what they are doing to the Tibetans? Are you boycotting Saudi's Arabia because of how they treat women? And Jordan doesn't allow Jews citizenship - that's outright discrimination- are you going to promote boycotting them? Hopefully you get my point. Thanks! Lois Kellerman Mountain View, CA
