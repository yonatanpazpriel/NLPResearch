To Whole It May Concern,
I was encouraged to hear that California was adding an ethnic studies curriculum for high school students -which would promote respect and honor everyone's diverse histories and contributions to our state/country/world. However, in reading the draft, I have become gravely concerned about the representation, or lack thereof, of American Jews. The ESMC fails to include the contributions American Jews have made in any meaningful way. There is no mention or exploration of anti-Semitism. Additionally at points, there are even hateful anti-Jewish stereotypes related to the completely one-sided, and biased criticism of Israel.
I strongly encourage you to not pass the curriculum as written -and take the time to include Jews in the curriculum, explore anti-Semitism and how this impacts the lives of American/Californian Jews, and also provide a multi-sided view of Israel and Palestine.
Thank you for your consideration, Samantha
