There is no US history or US politics without Ethnic Studies. It is unfathomable to me that Ethnic Studies curriculum wasn't made standard 60 years ago. Please make sure that students learn how the US nation was built, developed, and led to the unequal situation that we are in today, especially under renewed and open racism and antiimmigrant hatred. Thank you.
