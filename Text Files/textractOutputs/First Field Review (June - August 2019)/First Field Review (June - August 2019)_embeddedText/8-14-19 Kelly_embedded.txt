Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I'm shocked and saddened to see an obviously anti-Jewish agenda being considered for adoption within our public school systems. If the goal is to vilify and incite even violence against American Jews � then mission accomplished. But as a parent of young, Jewish children, I would rather leave California than have our family subjected to further discrimination and hate. The fact that blatant antisemitism is even being considered as part of any school curriculum is completely unacceptable. Have we learned nothing from history?

BDS

Glossary/ p.234 BDS supporters know very well that a demand for the right of return for ancestors and descendants (5-7m people) would spell the end of Israel as a Jewish state, and lead to immense terrorism if not outright warfare. It is a foolish and insupportable demand. Additionally BDS founder Omar Barghouti has expressed support for terrorism, promoted anti-Semitic conspiracy theories and regularly demonizes Israel. He opposes the Jewish right to self-determination and Israel's very existence, openly calling for its destruction as a Jewish state.

The above is just one example in one section � pages 234, 235, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 provide additional bias and anti-Israel / anti-Jewish examples. Please remember and consider that indoctrinating antisemitism was a core principle in teaching children under the Nazi regime.
What is (unsurprisingly) missing from the curriculum are lessons about American Jews as an ethic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East (both historically and in present day), and discrimination in the former Soviet Union � not to mention current day discrimination in the Europe and the USA (which is on the rise).
I urge you to please take this matter seriously, what we teach � or fail to teach - our children can have long-lasting, detrimental effects on our collective society.
