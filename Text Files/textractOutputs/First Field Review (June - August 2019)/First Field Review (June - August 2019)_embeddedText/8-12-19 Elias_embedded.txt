I object to the entire curriculum. It is not the job of the education department to
Implement a standard that sets to validate a specific ideological view on ethnic and "social justice" issues. Don't pretend that is not what is happening here. Schools already have a myriad of teachers and administrators that make it their life mission to inculcate their students with their personal beliefs on these topics. Setting the curriculum simply validates that unethical teaching practice. **if the goal is to further reduce public school enrollment of children, then by all means pass this curriculum and the associated AB bill making it a statewide mandated requirement**
