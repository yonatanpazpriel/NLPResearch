[Page 1, Line 7 � This line contains the first occurrence of the word hxrstory. With some investigation I discovered this is commonly pronounced as "herstory". Which suggests that the "x" is supposed to be replaced with an "e". However this type of spelling leaves open the possibility that the "x" can be replaced by other vowels. One such replacement is troubling and a potential discipline problem. That's when the "x" is replaced with an "o", so that in the spirit of this type of spelling it would sound like whxre. I would anticipate that students using that butchering of the word would be disciplined, hopefully in a reparative way. Perhaps this usage is already anticipated and designed to be a badge of honor similar to how some people use queer and slut. But using queer and slut as an honorific is not ubiquitous as some people still find them offensive and insulting. I also acknowledge that using the simple spelling herstory is still subject to the above butchering. Which means students will have to learn to use this word in a disciplined fashion to master it's intent. Which does beg the question as to why the word history is not appropriate as the etymology has nothing to do with the word his. Students could then learn instead to use the word history in a disciplined fashion for the past contributions of all people regardless of gender. ]
