There's only one culture that matters in this country, the American culture. Destroying it is the single most important job that this committee and those who create State "statute" are engaged in. Filling our kids minds with failed alternatives, negative bias, and disrespect for the foundation of our Republic, the Constitution, will allow for sociopathic politicians and this so called "advisory" committee the means to an end, destruction of our Blessed America. No low is low enough for those as sick as yourselves, State legislators and their so called "advisory" committees. This is what I teach my kids as I review your "curriculum" in the evening. We shall pray for your healing!
Thanks,
Dave S.
