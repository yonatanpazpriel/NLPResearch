I will assume you've read the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter dated July 29, 2019. I have read that letter and the Opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times today penned by Karin Klein. I will try and control my outrage at this despicable Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, suffice it to say it should be scrapped and a new set of educators, without the obvious bias of the current committee be tasked to prepare a new Model Curriculum draft. How the current draft reached the stage of public comment in its current form is a scandal.

If enormous changes are not made you can count on vigorous litigation to contest this model, starting with the outright lies concerning BDS. The US House recently passed with almost total bipartisan support an anti-BDS resolution. Four votes against were from the anti-Israel "Squad" and it appears that it is from their ilk that your committee is taking instruction.

Here's a link to Karin Klein's article today. https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/ If it were up to me I would have the committee who prepared this model publicly censured for the job they so poorly and inadequately performed and send them back to school. I'm sure you'll get lots of feedback on this. I'm sure it will be overwhelming.
