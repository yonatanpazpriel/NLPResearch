Hi there, I am concerned about the anti-Israel bias found in the model curriculum. Please reconsider including divisive and one-sided perspectives. At this time of increased polarization, our children need to learn how to hold conflicting viewpoints more than ever. When our society becomes divided, we all lose � and it seems to me that this curriculum will indeed contribute to that troubling trend. Please see: Page 2 of glossary [definition of BDS is itself a position that represents one side only] and pages 234, 242, 256, 264-269 of the sample course models for examples.
According to the stated goal of this curriculum, it should: "enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."' I am afraid that the
authors are blind to the true impact of this text, due to anti-Israel bias. This morning I opened my inbox to find an article about record high levels of attacks on Jews in Britain. This coincides with anti-Israel rhetoric. There is severe antiSemitism and very little understanding in our community about the nature of this pervasive hate and racism � I am afraid that the authors of this curriculum are either ignorant of this truth, or an active part of it � since they neglected to address it as a feature of this curriculum. That alone is evidence of clear bias.
