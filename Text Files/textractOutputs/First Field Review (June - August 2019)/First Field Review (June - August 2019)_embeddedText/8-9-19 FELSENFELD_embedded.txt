From: ARNOLD FELSENFELD Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:58 PM To: CFIRD Ethnic Studies Subject: Protest against Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing because I am against the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) in AB 3321. I am against the ESMC in principal because I think the purpose of schools is too assimilate the youth of our country into traditional American values not to produce a Balkanization of the United States. But if the ESMC must go forward, a major deficiency of the current proposed ESMC is that it omits any information about American Jews and anti-Semitism, glorifies the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement, is blatantly anti-Israel and even uses classic anti-Semitic tropes and stereotypes. Hate crimes against Jews are increasing world-wide and sadly even in this country. The shootings during this past year at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway are stark reminders. At my synagogue in Sherman Oaks, CA, our front day now must be locked and requires congregants to ring a doorbell and use a voice intercom for entry. Moreover, members of the so-called "Squad" in the House of Representatives have used blatant anti-Semitic tropes such as it is all about the Benjamins, Israeli politicians are running US foreign policy and Tel Aviv should be Palestinian city. Also, the notoriously anti-Semitic Louis Farrakhan enjoys popular support in some sectors in this country. Thus, if there is to be an ESMC, the study of and focus on anti-Semitism must be front and center and not excluded.
