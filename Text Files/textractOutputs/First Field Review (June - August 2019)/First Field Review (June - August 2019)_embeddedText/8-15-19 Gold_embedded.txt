From: frances gold Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Purposed Ethnic Curriculum
I am concerned that the proposed curriculum is badly flawed and will not address these important issues 1. Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned. 2. Antisemitism has been excluded from hate crimes even though half of religious based hate crimes in the US are against Jews. 3. The decisive BNS movement seeks to erase the State of Israel it is included with no balancing perspective. 4. A song with language that suggests Jews control the Media is included. I feel these items would cause more problems for discriminators and be more inciting to haters. Thank you for looking into these concerning issues as the whole point of this class is to develop understanding and peace between people of different ethnicities. Please I ask you to take some action here. As a second generation survivor of the Holocaust this is very important to to our children and with so much hatred being spread in our everyday lives what our children learn in schools is paramount to ending hatred. Sincerely. Frances Gold
