To whom It Concerns This new curriculum is blatantly anti-Semitic What do you expect when it gets written by three people who have expressed anti-Israel sentiment. I believe ethnic studies are important, but not anti-Semitic studies! (Or anti any group) Stop this at once. Gale Gordon MD Pediatrician
