Public School curriculum should be fact-based only and should be devoid of subjective agendas. The BDS agenda admittedly promotes hate, anti-Semitism and divisiveness, and even heinously claims "apartheid conditions", although the facts show the opposite to be true in every area of Israeli society. I urge the removal of the BDS narrative and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Please reference Glossary pg. 2.

I urge the state to add lessons about American Jewry as an ethnic group, including facts referencing those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Lessons should also acknowledge the misusage of the word Palestinian (a term coined in 1968 for the purpose of vilifying the state of Israel) by referring only to Arabs of the region, and not the Jews, though the Jewish people have lived in the region for 3,000 years, and are equally "Palestinian." Your proposed curriculum lesson plan encourages teachers to highlight BDS from a biased, one-sided perspective, while ignoring many factual points. Your proposed model curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. Please reference Sample Course Models Chapter 2, pgs. 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269. All perspectives should be acknowledged, and all sides taught, with facts and substantiation.
