It is of vital importance, especially now with the rise of world-wide anti-semitism that the state of California include Jewish issues in its ethnic studies program. We are the pillar of America's fight to keep diverse communities protected and understood. Let's not forget the Holocaust and the centuries of bias and stereotypes of the Jewish people.
Thank you for your consideration of my thoughts.
