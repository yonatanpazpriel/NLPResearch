From: Nancy Seid Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 5:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti-semitism in the ethnic studies curriculum
To the State Board of Education, I am very concerned about the treatment of both Jews and Israel by the new proposed ethnic studies curriculum. In a time when anti-semitism is very much on the rise, it is a terrible lie of omission to be asked to instruct our students about prejudice without highlighting anti-semitism. At the same time, it's both easy and wrong to lean into anti-Israel bias such as that expressed by the BDS movement. That movement punishes Israel alone for actions that many countries have taken, while ignoring much worse human rights abuses around the world. It is important to work for equal rights within Israel, but the BDS movement does nothing but vilify the entire country, while supporting anti-semitic tropes. Please reconsider and reconfigure the curriculum to reflect the reality of anti-semitism in our own country as well as in the world. Sincerely, Nancy Seid Los Angeles
