In regard to the discussion about the BDS movement, the definition does not mention that the BDS movement is inherently anti-Semitic. It fails to recognize the right to Jewish self-determination. Half of Jews in Israel are Mizrahi Jews- refugees from persecution in the neighboring Arabic countries. Moreover, many terrorist organizations, such as Hamas, are financially and organizationally involved in BDS. In the Hamas Charter, it explicitly states that Jews, "have only negative traits and are presented as planning to take over the world." Many of my family members were victims to this type of disgusting anti-Semitic verbiage during WWII. No mandated state curriculum should ever include any lessons endorsing, using, or referencing the BDS movement because doing so would give approval to the movement. A movement that is endorsed by terrorist organizations whose leaders have clearly stated that they hope that Jews will gather in Israel so he doesn't need to hunt us down.

I resent the term "Israeli Colony" (268). Israel is a Jewish country that is approximately 75% Jewish, 20% Arabic, and 5% other. Half of the Jews are Mizrahi Jews who escaped persecution in neighboring Arabic countries. They are indigenous to the area. In fact ultimately al Jews are indeigenous to the area. Genetic studies demonstrate the vast majority are Semitic people whose descendants come from the Middle East.
