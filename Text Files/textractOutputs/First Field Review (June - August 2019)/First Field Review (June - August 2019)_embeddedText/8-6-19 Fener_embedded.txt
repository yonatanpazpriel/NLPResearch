Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Please add to the curriculum information about the Holocaust and American Jews who fled oppression in the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. Teach that antiSemitism is on the rise. Teach that 6,000,000 Jews died in the Holocaust and it wasn't even that long ago! We are in danger of forgetting and that is a disgrace. I am attaching page 2 of one document and pages 234, 237, 242, 256 and 264269 of another document.

Page 2:
Assimilation- the process whereby a historically marginalized person or group voluntarily or involuntarily adopts the social, psychological, cultural, and political characteristics of a dominant group. B Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.

C Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified.
Character- A combination of qualities (i.e. mental, moral, ethical, etc.) that render a person distinctly unique.
Chicana/o/x- A contested social and political identity chosen by people living in the United States with Mexican and indigenous ancestry. The term with the `x' is pronounced with an `-ex' sound at the end of the word.

1. What are the similarities and differences between the immigration patterns among Arabs throughout US history?
2. What are the similarities and differences in the experiences of Arab groups after immigrating to America?
3. How are the experiences of Arab immigrants connected to those of other communities?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Time Required: 100-150 minutes
 Teacher distributes the "History of Arab Immigration to the United States" handout to students the day before the lesson. Depending on time, teacher can either have students read the handout for homework or as a warm up. Students are assigned to mark three points that surprised them and write out three questions they have after reading the handout.
 Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as "Arab," (e.g. predominantly Arabicspeaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)
 Teacher has students take out the handout that they read for homework along with their questions. Teacher asks students to share what points surprised them. Teacher collects their questions and uses them to inform the next day of teaching. (5-10 min)

256:
The influx of immigrants from outside Western Europe in the late nineteenth century provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year.
The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was smaller (less than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. Immigrants both Christian and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.
Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and considered their Arab identity politically central. The term "Arab" is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. Iraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

264-269: And set the standard straight about the violent circuit From bomb makers stripping Islam Naked The strong face of the wrong fakers, in calm nature, see The truth in America's hip-hop is gone sacred Not to generalize, dawg, this song's racist
[Outro]
So don't get it twisted See not all Arabs are rich, my brothers and sisters Get your history right "Arab money' came from British colonialism So that means the slave master got you back So when you look at that money in your pocket Make sure you spend it right

T� nos dices que debemos sentarnos Pero las ideas s�lo pueden levantarnos Caminar, recorrer, no rendirse ni retroceder Ver, aprender como esponja absorbe Nadie sobra, todos faltan, todos suman Todos para todos, todo para nosotros So�amos en grande que se caiga el imperio Lo gritamos alto, no queda m�s remedio Esto no es utop�a, es alegre rebeld�a Del baile de los que sobran, de la danza tuya y m�a Levantarnos para decir "ya basta" Ni �frica, ni Am�rica Latina se subasta Con barro, con casco, con l�piz, zapatear el fiasco Provocar un social terremoto en este charco

Arabic Verse Rapped by Shadia Mansour
(Give me the microphone) Music is the mother tongue of the world It supports our existence, and it protects our roots We unite from Greater Syria, Africa, to Latin America Here I am with Anita Tegucas Here I am with those who suffer, not with those who sold you Here I am with cultural resistance From the beginning, to victory always! I am with those who are against, with those who have cooperated, with those who are not on our side Some time ago, I calculated, so I decided to invest in Panxi after Pan-Ki broke up As the saying goes, "the situation must be threatened but in reality the situation must stop" For every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded For each greeting, a thousand houses were demolished They use the press so they can manufacture, but when my sentence is judged, reality presents itself
