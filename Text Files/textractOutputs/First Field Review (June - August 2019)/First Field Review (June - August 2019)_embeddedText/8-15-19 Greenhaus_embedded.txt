Dear Sirs, Madam:
I was alerted to the need to comment on the curriculum by some people that I almost never agree with and thought initially that they must be misrepresenting the nature of the curriculum, since it seemed absurd that they could be correct. However, upon reading the curriculum for myself, I was shocked to see that a curriculum that states as its intention to assist teachers in forming a curriculum to become more culturally sensitive could completely omit any mention of antisemitism. That is, in several placed where things like racism and Islamophobia are mentioned, there is no mention at all of antisemitism. Antisemitism is one of the leading causes of ethnic related violence. I live and pray in the Poway community and can't believe that there is no mention of the issues that Jews face today regarding antisemitism and the violence that is directed at Jews. While Jews are not as economically disadvantaged by antisemitism as blacks by racism and other groups by prejudice against their particular group, Jews live in fear of violence that has been perpetrated against them on a regular basis and which has significantly increased.
I strongly urge you to reconsider adopting this and please take a more balanced approach to these very important issues. Peoples very lives rely upon what you do and say.
