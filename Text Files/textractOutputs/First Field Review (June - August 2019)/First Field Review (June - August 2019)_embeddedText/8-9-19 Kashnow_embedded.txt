From: Marcia Kashnow Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 10:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Program being considered by state of CA
The State of California is currently reviewing a model ethnic studies curriculum, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. Moreover, despite its stated purpose, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism.
I am Jewish and concerned about a curriculum with a bias against Jews. Marcia Kashnow 10 Faxon Forest Atherton, CA 94027
