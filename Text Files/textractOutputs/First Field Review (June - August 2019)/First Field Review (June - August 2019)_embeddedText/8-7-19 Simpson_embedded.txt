Dear Committe members:
Considering any sort of BDS or anti-Israel material is both inhumane and anti-Semitic. Consider what you are doing carefully. Any Arabic members who belong are terrorist-supporting anti-semetic, terroristloving anti-Jewish supporters. Passing this horrendous curriculum will surely result in your own demise and destroy California's education system.
