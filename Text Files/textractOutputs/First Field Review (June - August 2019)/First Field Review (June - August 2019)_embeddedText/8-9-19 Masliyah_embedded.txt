I was an Ethnic Studies Major in college, so I can appreciate that our state is considering updating our curriculum. However, I would encourage you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
The current Model Curriculum erases the histories, voices, and experiences of American minority communities from the Middle East and North Africa � including those of Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews of which I am one. The Arab American Studies Course needs be overhauled and re-written with the involvement and oversight of a representative committee of diverse Middle Eastern communities residing in California.

I also believe it is critical to remove the unbalanced definition of BDS from the glossary of terms and to include a working definition for antisemitism. The Model Curriculum excludes any reference to antisemitism and its current manifestations. As 2018 FBI statistics have noted, hate crimes against Jews have risen by 37% accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. It is at this time that the American Jewish community, particularly students and young adults, are in need of consideration, and support.
