From: bruanders Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Proposed Curriculum
As a retired public school teacher with 50 years of experience and as a Jew, I must take issue with the current draft of the curriculum for Ethnic Studies.
This can be a very valuable class which teaches about the experiences of the many ethnic strands in our country and the many contributions each has made.
Looking at the country's history through the eyes of different ethnicities, races, etc. can only widen each student's perspective and experience of the historical facts.
However, I am mighty disappointed at the absence of the topic of antisemitism. Also disappointing is the omission of comparative narratives Israeli and Palestinian regarding that particular history and its reverberations here in the US.
You DO need to make these changes before adopting the curriculum.
Thanks for considering my comments
