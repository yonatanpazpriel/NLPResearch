From: Kristian Howard Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I find it difficult to believe that you are seriously considering this highly offensive curriculum. It focuses on social justice rather than on achievement and real education. The subjects presented are not suitable for children K-12 and are more appropriate for college level considerations.
I would encourage you, as a lifelong citizen and taxpayer of the great State of California, to reject this curriculum and formulate one where the focus is not on social justice, but on excellence in education and life-long learning to prepare them for excellence as citizens. Anything less is a disservice and abusive to millions of California children.
I am not an activist, but the adoption of this curriculum will well make me one and I will resist it with all that I have.
As a Black Californian, I find it offensive that a bunch of elitists believe that we as a people cannot solve our problems locally and need your unwanted guidance and direction in rearing our children and the goals to be divisive and nefarious. We need support for the solutions developed in our own school districts as one size does not fit all.
I strongly urge you to dismiss this proposal.
Sincerely,
Kristian D. Howard Sr. Californian, Parent, Taxpayer
