Please accept this statement in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support this effort as someone who teaches at American River College with this content and as a former Twin Rivers Unified School District Boardmember. I have seen first hand the changing demographics that are far outpacing their representation and respect in the classic curriculum. We are losing whole communities of students that should be the foundation of California's future, and part of that reason is that many students don't feel that their communities are valued. This Curriculum, especially with its multidisciplinary/intersectional perspective, will go a long way to saving our state.
