From: Helen H. Hsu Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: support for high school ethnic studies curriculum
As a student, and now educator, who was not exposed to ethnic studies until young adulthood at UCLA, I personally know the value of imparting ethnic historical education to young developing adults. Native American, Asian American studies courses and later learning about Latinx and African American history changed my self concept and life for the beter and I hope CA will stand firm in its committment to provide this educational tool to our youth.
