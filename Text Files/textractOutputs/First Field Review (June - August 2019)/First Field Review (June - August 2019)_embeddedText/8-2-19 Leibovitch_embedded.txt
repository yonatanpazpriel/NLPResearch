The curriculum as drafted presents a picture of Israel, an ally of the United States, as an illegitimate country oppressing Arabs (Palestinians) without cause. Considering the senseless murder of Syria, the terror of Iran, the oppression of Lebanon, the disregard of the rights of women, Christians, LGBTQ, and others across most countries the portrayal of Israel and the characterization of the Arab-Israel conflict is misleading and propaganda that does not belong in an educational setting where the goal is "an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Furthermore the experience and culture of Jews in the region is completely ignored. This can only exacerbate the rise of anti Semitism and promote a political agenda that is contrary to the interests of the U.S.-Israel alliance and long term prospects for Middle East peace.

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) is a political movement based on refutable claims (such as the false equivalence with South African apartheid) which is widely disputed. The description in the glossary portrays BDS only from

the side of its proponents with no context for the relationships between Israel and the Arab citizens of Israel, the Arabs under authority of the Palestinian Authority, and the Arabs in all the vast Arab-controlled territory (where Palestinian identity results in vastly unequal treatment that doesn't get the attention of the BDS movement).
Page 234
The sample lesson plans for the curriculum highlights BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, again without context or balance. The topic comparing borders of Palestine and Mexico is inflammatory to say the least, and not comparable, since the border security in Israel was a response to direct terror attacks--which are down dramatically. Page 237 and 241
Reference to Israel-Palestine as a country comparable to other countries is at best unclear. Israel is a sovereign recognized country, Palestine is a stateless identity with a future separate from Israel (not consuming Israel) that will be determined when and if negotiations resume. Page 242
The displacement of Arabs is discussed without any context, for example the fact that the war was initiated by Arab countries intent on exterminating Jews and the potential of a Jewish state disregarding the Partition Plan or Jewish residents of the area. Page 256
Introducing a song "Somos Sur" that is critical of Israel again with no balance in the curriculum.
