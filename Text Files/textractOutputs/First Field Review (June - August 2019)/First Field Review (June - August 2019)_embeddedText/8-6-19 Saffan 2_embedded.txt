From: David Saffan Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 5:29 PM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Use of "hxstory"
Dear Mr. McDonald, I only got as far as the 8th line of page 1 of the new proposed ethnic curriculum guidelines, when I ran into "hxstorically," a word to replace 'historically.' The people who came up with this apparently feel its perfectly all right to promote fake history and ignorance by implying that the word 'history' comes from the English word 'his.' The word 'history' has NOTHING to do with the word 'his.' It is from the Latin 'historia,' which is from the earlier Greek 'istoria.' The original meaning of the word was 'inquiry.' Apparently this committee doesn't mind that a whole generation of students will grow up thinking that the word 'history' comes from 'his' -- and has now been corrected! This is downright Orwellian. To think that 'educators' put this together is really disheartening. Sincerely, David Saffan
