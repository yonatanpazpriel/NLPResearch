I respectfully urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discriminations in the former Soviet Union. It is vitally important to promote inclusion in all of our public schools and not promote hate or division. To support one side over the other without presenting both sides of the argument does not allow the students to engage in a healthy discussion of this vitally important issue of our time and creates future bias towards Israel and the Jewish people.
