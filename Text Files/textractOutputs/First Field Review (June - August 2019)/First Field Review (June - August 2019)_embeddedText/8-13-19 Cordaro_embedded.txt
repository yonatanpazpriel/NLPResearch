Although this curriculum was designed with all good intentions I find it appallingly naive and historically inaccurate. If you care to research US immigration history you would find that people today considered "white" were not considered so when they arrived: Italians, Jews, Eastern Europeans. They are excluded from this curriculum as if their stories don't matter. Yet they persevered and succeeded through generations of their labor and contributions to society only to now be seen as "oppressors".
The entire framework of "colonialism" is interpreted as a "white only" phenomenon yet colonialism, feudalism, repression and enslavement are as old as human history and have been practiced in every culture and continent. Ancient Egyptians enslaved others as did Arabs in the Middle Ages and on and on. And even today, we have "color on color" repression: Hindu vs Muslim and the appropriation of Kashmir; Burmese Buddhists engaging in genocide against their Muslim countrymen; Chinese Han vs. Uighur Muslims; Tutsi vs. Hutu and that genocide; and most shocking, the legal institution of slavery in Mauritania which is black-on black! So to castigate "whites" and declare this is a white supremacy issue is not only inaccurate, but bound to invite further dissension and polarization.
It is also a deeply divisive and offensive curriculum when you have students "take one step forward if you: "have 2 parents; have ever gone to a museum, gone to a program or camp". Are you dismissing and shaming parents who are taking some steps to provide learning opportunities for their kids and the sacrifices that they make to do so? How about all the kids in the Tenderloin in SF (where I teach) who take part in the Boys and Girls Club activities that seeks to provide enrichment opportunities their parents can't or won't expose them to? Are they suddenly "privileged? The taxpayers should revolt against paying for or implementing this trite and demeaning curriculum.
