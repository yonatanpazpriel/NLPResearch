From: Winick, Herman Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To: Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education From: Herman Winick I am in favor of ethnic studies. However, based on my experience as an educator, and my concerns as a parent and grandparent, major revisions are needed to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, along the lines of the recommendations by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, and Amcha. A balanced ethnic studies program is urgently needed, particularly to help stem the recent rise in anti-Semitic events, before events such as Charlottesvile, Pittsburg and Poway are repeated. The fear in the Jewish community resulting from these events have made it necessary for guards to be hired at local Jewish congregations. I am very disturbed by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and strongly urge major revisions to address the above concerns. Sincerely, Herman Winick
