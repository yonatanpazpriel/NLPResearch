From: Hudson, Jennifer Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
My name is Jennifer Hudson and I am writing to express concern over the new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). As a Social Studies teacher at the high school level, I have taught the state standards and curriculum for over 15 years and have often been disappointed in the lack of representation in the curriculum for my minority students. My students don't see their stories in our textbooks that cater to European and Caucasian American histories. The hope of an Ethnic Studies curriculum that would encourage the study of all of the groups represented in my classroom. However, in reading the current draft, I am disappointed to see that the Jewish people and their stories have been excluded.
As a teacher with experience in curriculum writing, I know when I first write out a lesson plan or content material, it takes quite a few drafts before it is ready for my students. Clearly, the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is in need of adjustments to provide inclusion for the Jewish story.
With the increase of hate crimes targeting Jews and other ethnic/religious groups, to exclude the teaching of Jewish history, the Jewish people, and antisemitism would be an egregious mistake. I can't bear to teach yet another curriculum that leaves out and further marginalizes students in my classroom. All of their stories matter and all of them deserve to be taught. We must educate our children to understand that all people deserve the same rights and privileges...and that all people deserve to have their story told.
I look forward to seeing this oversight addressed in your next draft. I look forward to teaching a curriculum that honors and respects ALL of my students.
Thank you for your consideration,
