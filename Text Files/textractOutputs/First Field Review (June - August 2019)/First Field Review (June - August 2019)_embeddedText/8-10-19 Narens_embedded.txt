Are seriously considering teaching anti Israel and Jewish bias under the guide of the Boycott Divest and Sanction movement against Israel?
When did california become a Nazi propaganda machine. There are two sides to every story and the BDS makes lies and doesn't explain the full history or context about the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict. Palestinians leaders are dictators doing more harm against their own people. Why no Palestinian Elections? Why is Hamas, a terror organization not treated the same as ISIS.
Why hasn't the Palestinians accepted peace and the creation of their own country which they denied 4 times since 1947? Or that they lost the wars against the Jewish people that they started. And if they would have won those wars they would have finished what Hilter didn't. And why no teaching of how a million Jews were killed or kicked out of their Arab home countries in which they lived for thousands of years like Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, Morocco to name a few. Just like you did with the native Californian Indians, your are erasing the history and factual information of Israel and the Jewish people. Shame on you California!
I'm a proud American Jew who's safety was threatened daily while attending SFSU during pro BDS marches. After graduating I moved to Israel and volunteered with the IDF and while living and serving there I realized how awful and wrong the BDS is. Public schools should be teaching the truth and context of the situation which will result in peace, not hate and lies that the BDS pushes.
Please do not side with BDS and teach their hatful bias on my tax paying money!!!
Thank you, Sam Narens
