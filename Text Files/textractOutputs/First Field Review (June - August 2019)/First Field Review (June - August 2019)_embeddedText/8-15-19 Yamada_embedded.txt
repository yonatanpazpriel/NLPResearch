As a longtime supporter of Ethnic Studies at every level of our educational system, I commend all those who have, are, and will continue to work towards establishing a truthful, comprehensive, and inclusive model curriculum reflecting the rich diversity of California and our Nation. Achieving this is no easy task because history is being written every day, and there is no group without an important story. As the model curriculum continues to be considered, I believe it critical to keep-in-mind that no one document will truly be able to capture or reflect the fullness of a specific people's experiences, and certainly not during the proposed one-semester graduation requirement. Frankly, it would be impossible to cover even one "major"community's history over such a short time period. That the Draft Curriculum has recently evoked strong reactions reinforces that Ethnic Studies are valued and no one wants to be left out. Going forward, the advisors and policymakers should seek a balance and articulate clear definitions of what Ethnic Studies is--and is not. All participants in the dialogue should view this as a "work-in-forever-progress", because so much of the truth of our "American Story" is the history and existence of discrimination, violence, and hatred of "the Other", whether that is defined by race, gender, ethnicity, religion, national origin, orientation, physical and/or mental disability, employment or housing status or size. Best Wishes.
