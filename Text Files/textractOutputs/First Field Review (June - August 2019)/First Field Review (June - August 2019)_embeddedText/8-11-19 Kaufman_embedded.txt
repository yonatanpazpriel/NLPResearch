From: Kenneth Kaufman Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies anti-Semitic
To be a Jew in the USA is now to feel unsafe. I am appalled that California is considering to indoctrinate our children with anti-Semitic attitudes. The ignorance displayed in the Ethnic Studies curriculum suggests an undercurrent of Jew hatred and an attitude towards Israel and Jewish rights that is clearly drawn from ill informed radical anti-Israel political propaganda. Shame on California
