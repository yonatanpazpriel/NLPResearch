My name is Joshua Saidoff. I have taught the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the university level in one of our state's premier public academic institutions. I can say that the curricular materials pertaining to the Israeli-Palestinian neither meet the standards to which I hold myself nor to which my institution holds me. By presenting only one perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (one of the most highly contentious and divisive issues on college campuses) and then promoting the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel - as the curriculum does in the sample module on Arab American Studies (page 34, line 684) and the Arab American Studies course outline (page 234, line 4957), the materials plainly violate the University of California Regent's Policy on Course Content. That policy prohibits, "Misuse of the classroom by, for example, allowing it to be used for political indoctrination." In case there is any disagreement over what constitutes indoctrination, I will refer you to the Merriam Webster Dictionary. Its definition of "indoctrinate" is "to teach (someone) to fully accept the ideas, opinions, and beliefs of a particular group and to not consider other ideas, opinions, and beliefs." There is little doubt that the sum of the curricular materials pertaining to Israel-Palestine do precisely that.

The curriculum not only fails to provide any materials sympathetic to an Israeli or Jewish perspective, it fails to present Judaism or anti-Semitism at all. By omitting Jews, the Ethnic Studies curriculum plainly fails its mandate to promote understanding and inclusion. It also perpetuates a highly troubling dynamic on University campuses and within the larger body politic, in which Jews (unless advocating against their own community) are excluded from minority and interracial coalitions. The curriculum plainly promotes interracial solidarity, linking Palestinian travails to those of African, and Latin American groups (on page 234 line 4958, all of page 256, all of page 265 especially lines 5716-5719). It makes no provision whatsoever for Jews.

Further, by uncritically presenting the BDS movement against Israel (as it does on page 2 of the glossary, and in the places noted above), the curriculum, in effect, promotes a movement which has been decried as anti-Semitic and /or has been roundly repudiated by the majority of Jewish groups and by government bodies like the US Congress and German Bundestag.
