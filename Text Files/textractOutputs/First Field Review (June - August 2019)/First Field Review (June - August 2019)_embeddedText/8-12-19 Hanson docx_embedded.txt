Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am writing to urge you to make major revisions to the the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As an educational researcher/program evaluator and small family foundation funder, I support teaching ethnic studies to high school students using a curriculum that promotes inclusion and tolerance. As I understand it, the current one being considered fails to include Jewish people as a historically oppressed people and discuss antisemitism. This seems like a significant oversight that should be corrected in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which is intended to help build a shared understanding of different ethnic groups' perspectives.
Thank you, Susan Glikbarg Hanson
