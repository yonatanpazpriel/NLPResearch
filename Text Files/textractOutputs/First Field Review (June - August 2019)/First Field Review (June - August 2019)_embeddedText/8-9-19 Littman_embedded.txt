Hi, I am a California resident, living in Irvine. I applaud the attempt to try to increase student understanding of ethnicity and racism. However, I have concerns about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum, with regards to coverage of the Israeli Palestinian conflict. I have attached the comment template with a few representative comments.
Summary of my concerns: 1) I am concerned that if the Israeli/Palestinian conflict is not taught evenly and fairly, it will inspire a new generation of Californians to have negative feelings towards Israel and Jews. Two of my sons have graduated from the UC system, one from UCLA and one from UCI. I have witnessed first hand how the pro Palestinian student groups have harassed and tried to intimidate Jewish students. 2) Theresa Montano and Samia Shoman have either published or signed material that is anti Israel. I have doubts that they will be even handed in selecting content. 3) To reduce inflammatory content, content should be reviewed and accepted by moderate voices on both sides of the issue. This will help eliminate factual errors, or errors of omission or lack of context. If this is impossible, then both sides of the argument should be fairly presented. 4) Content needs to be put in proper perspective. For example, it is legitimate to criticize Israel for documented human rights violations. It should be pointed out that not all reported violations are legitimate, such as the woman who brought a dead child to a Gaza protest and claimed the child was killed by Israelis. Furthermore, when considering topics like BDS, students should understand how Israel's support for human rights compares with that of Russia, China and Saudi Arabia.
Thanks for listening. Jay Littman - Irvine

Page 236, Line 5153. The description of the "Nakba" needs to have context and explanations from both sides. In 1948 there was a proposal to create a Jewish and Palestinian state. The "catastrophe" was that a Jewish state was created at all.
Page 2, Line 30. The description of BDS needs to have context and explanations from both sides. The founder of BDS (Barghouti) admits his aim is to destroy Israel. BDS proponents claim to be interested in human rights, but only focus on human rights violations in Israel. Nothing about China, Russia, or Arab Countries.
