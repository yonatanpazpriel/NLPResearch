On Page 2 of the glossary for the curriculum there is a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". This movement is a intentional undermining and concerned effort to de-legitimize the State of Israel in it's entirety. It doesn't attack a specific policy. It's intent is to end Israel's existence. BDS representatives come out and say as much, they do not hide it. They are actively lobbying for the eradication of a democratic country one of the only democratic countries in the middle east where 3 languages are the native languages including Arabic, with arab and Christian and druzi and more integrated as citizens in government, army and more. The only place arguably in the middle east where gays and lesbians can be free and celebrated. There is no way to describe that as apartheid. It's just inaccurate.

On pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:
Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

This is a one sided perspective by the BDS movement to indoctrinate a generation with one sided information with no sense of perspective of the realities on the ground in the middle east and behaviors of the Palestinian violence that threatens peace and has put the Israeli society under war like conditions on a daily basis.

There are real opportunities as well to educate about Israel's value of life, going to great steps to save refugees for example in Ethiopia and bringing them to Israel. A film on Netflix released recently provides a beautiful look into Operation Exodus that brought thousands of Jewish refugees airlifted in the 1970's to Israel out of the ravages of civil war there.

Teachers should be put in a position to educate accurately and present the complexity of the situation in the middle east and these lesson plans and materials do not set them up for success.

develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."
Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

I hope you'll consider adding lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

I have two teens in the public school system in CA and we travel to Israel every year to see family and friends. My teens have a strong understanding of both sides, strong feelings about inclusion and find it enormously challenging when materials or faculty present distorted and one sided perspectives.

The curriculum does a disservice to both the education system and the communities who put their trust in the education system by failing to provide solid perspective and information about history and realities on the ground.
