Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. The curriculum leaves out Jewish Americans as a group, which is important. There are many American Jews who are living among us who fled the Holocaust and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. The BDS movement is very hateful and divisive and I don't understand why you want to teach that when your main aim seems to be the opposite. Please remove anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum.
