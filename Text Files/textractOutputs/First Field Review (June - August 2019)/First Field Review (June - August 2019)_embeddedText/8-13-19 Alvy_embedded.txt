Due to the wars in the world the United States has a responsibility to stay united in accepting all faiths and equally valuing them. I've learned that this future ethnic class will include doctrines that oppose different faiths that could create ill feelings and war. I'm speaking of the lack of Jewish representation in this class. Moslems and Arabs cited in the curriculum paint negative views of Jews. Hating the other and finding faults with the other in literature poetry and speech breeds I'll feelings. Being united is seeking the good and common values cultivated peace. Please consider including Jewish studies in a positive light. Cultures have benefited in the fields of science medicine arts philanthropy. The future is in your hands to create peace.
