It is without reservation I write to you. The world is in dire straits with all the killings brought on by uneducated or falsely educated White Supremists and others who emulate same and have no qualms about committing murder. Most of the murders committed by young men. If the world is to get along it is imperative it begins with early childhood education. We're all sick and tired of a universe that runs rampant with hate. I urge you to adjust your curriculum accordingly. Make this a better world where people get along.
