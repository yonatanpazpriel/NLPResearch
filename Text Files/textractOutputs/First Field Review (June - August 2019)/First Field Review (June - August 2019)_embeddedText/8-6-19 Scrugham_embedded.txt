From: Jennifer Scrugham Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 12:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment on proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum
After familiarizing myself with the proposed ethnic studies curriculum, I find it absolutely appalling. In fact, I'm shocked that something this far left would actually be taught to school children. The writers did not bother to get input from anyone who sees these matters differently, thus making this resource a very intolerant one. As a former educator myself, I find the material extremely biased as well, perhaps among the most polarizing and hateful I've seen. It is politics and brainwashing of young children.
