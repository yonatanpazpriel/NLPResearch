From: Mara Parker Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
My name is Mara Parker. I am a parent of two, I reside in San Diego County, and I work for the California State University system. I am also a Jew. I have been the victim of anti-semitic name-calling and discrimination at various times my entire life, as have my children. I am very concerned about the omission of Judaism/anti-Semitism in your Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. At a time when anti-semitic attacks are on the rise in CA and all over the world, I am quite angry that Judaism was not included. The omission of such history is abhorrent, ignorant, and insensitive. Judaism is not just a religion. It is a race and ethnicity. Many Jews consider themselves people of color and are thus subjected to similar violence and discrimination.
I ask that you return to the drawing board and include Judaism/anti-Semitism in your
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely,
Mara Parker
