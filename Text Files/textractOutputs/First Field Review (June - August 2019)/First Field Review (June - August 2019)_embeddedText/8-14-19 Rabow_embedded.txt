No mention of Anti-Semitism? Contrast that with the extensive coverage of Islamophobia and anti-black, -latino, and -native American ideologies. "Capitalism": Why should we be teaching our children that Capitalism is inherently a tool of oppression? In general, Filled with dog-whistle terms that are outside of normal vocabulary, and serve as instruments of spreading hatred, victimization, and exclusion.

p. 234: A shameful call to BDS, which is an on-going tool of anti-semitism. Why are we training children to be activists in creating hatred? It's no secret that BDS has now become in the academic world a litmus test for oppression of Jews and others. Do we permit that for any other democratic ally of our country? And why does this domestic school curriculum train advocacy for perceived international situations (or rather, the situation in the single Jewish state in the last 2,000 years)? p. 242: The Palestinian term for the 1948 "Palestinian" War? This was a War of Jewish survival initiated by the attacking Arab countries surrounding Israel, a democratic nation recognized by the United Nations and by the United States. P. 256: We should not weaponize music in the service of inculcating a sense of hatred and victimization. pp. 264-269: Declaring the goal of freeing the "Palestinian Soil" is historically untrue (if the coin of truth still retains some value). And why is the Jewish State of Israel the sole international problem that is focused upon in this so-called curriculum? I'm trying to tamp down my anger, and, yes, fear, over what I have had time to read of this proposal. The anti-semitism in this proposal is as clear as the chants of the neo-Nazis in the Charlottesville videos. I didn't notice any mention of the Shoah (but you sure knew how to spell and translate the "Nakba"). It's been three-quarters of a century since I had to literally run home after school, to avoid being beaten up by anti-Semitic bullies in the nice middle-class suburb where I was born and raised � so please forgive me if I'm not seeing much progress here.

This proposed curriculum doesn't just need some balancing and tweaking. I believe it should be totally scrapped, and the important work of ethnic studies should be planned based upon appropriate American core values: The goal should be to offer the opportunity for our children to learn about the history and contributions of the various cultures that make up America. There's some evidence that this could lead to raising citizens who can accept, respect, and embrace cultural differences. The program should not attempt to train and direct political activism aimed at erasing any minority, nor to elevate victimization or encourage politically correct language that encourages exclusion and hate. And frankly, making skin tone the marker of acceptability is as wrong when it stereotypes white Americans as when it stereotypes black and brown Americans. When I go to my synagogue, I now have to pass through elaborate armed security procedures � I certainly don't feel like I'm reaping the benefits of white privilege.
