This proposed curriculum is appalling in that the primary purpose is not to educate but to indoctrinate. Per the document, ethnic studies is defined partially as "educational and racial justice" and is grounded in the belief that "education can be a tool for... social change and liberation" (pg 13). The obvious objective of this curriculum is not to broaden our students' thinking but to train students to become ideological activists.

The curriculum talks about development of critical thinking but usually offers just one side of the issue. Why are not a range of ideas presented so students can sharpen their perspective through debate and critical thinking? Why are students not exposed to a range of sources that provide thoughtful analysis of both sides of an issue? A good example is the assignment asking students to advocate for voting rights of illegal immigrants. Why wouldn't students be encouraged to explore the position that voting is a prerogative of citizens? Of exceptional offense are the references to capitalism- a fundamental American economic value- as a form of oppression tantamount to "white supremacy, racism, and patriarchy". I'm certainly on board with exploring the pitfalls of capitalism but where is the discussion about the enormous, documented advantages of capitalism? Why are students not allowed to debate the merits of the curriculum's assertion? The document states that "division is antithetical" to ethnic studies but proposed curriculum does not address commonalities nor encourage healthy discourse. It is clear that diversity of thought is not a core value and that student dissention to the stated agenda would not be encouraged (or perhaps even tolerated). What is the educational purpose behind discussing rap lyrics and familiarizing students with derogatory terms/stereotypes associated with a particular culture? How is this empowering for anyone?
