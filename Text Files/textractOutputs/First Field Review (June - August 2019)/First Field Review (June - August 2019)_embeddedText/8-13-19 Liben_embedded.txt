As the head of human resources at a global law firm with offices in California, I am deeply knowledgeable about and committed to the issues this curriculum is aiming to tackle. I also am a knowledgeable and committed Jew, the mother of five and married to a rabbi. I read with alarm your proposed curriculum. It is bizarrely silent on the centuries old ethnic hatred of antiSemitism which is sadly a scourge today. Compounding that inexplicable silence, the curriculum advocates for the anti-Israel and anti-Jewish BDS boycott of Jewish academics and products (note that Congress has decried this boycott which is illegal in many states). I implore you to take a hard look at the proposed curriculum and fix these fatal flaws. Thank you, Fran Liben
