Page 1 omits a definition of antisemitism; and page 2 includes a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions). pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and pages 264-269; Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61); and pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
