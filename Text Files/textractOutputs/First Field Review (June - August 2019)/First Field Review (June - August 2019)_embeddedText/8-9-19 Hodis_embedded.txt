Ethnic studies committee, It is clear to see that Jewish History, Jewish people's struggles in the USA and around the world was not included in your proposal for ethnic studies. The word Antisemitism is non existent in your proposal.
As a Psychoanalyst and Professor of Ethnic studies and Psychotherapy it is sad to see that omitting any learning about the Jewish struggles is a grave mistake.
There is no question that color bias exists consciously or unconsciously but Antisemitism exists in the United States in America from its inception to this day.
The omission speaks for itself. It is very bad indeed to see all the ethnic minorities mention including Arab and Muslims as a minority, But Jews were totally omitted. Word speak loud and clear.... It is disappointing that such educated, open minded and clear thinking people who proposed this wonderful and much needed program of Ethnic Studies totally "Forgot"about the Jewish plight. Thank you for your consideration
