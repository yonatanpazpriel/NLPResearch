Page 2, Lines 30 to 40: The Glossary asserts that BDS is to "...establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." BDS is given immediate standing--there are no critical perspectives about this hate campaign, which wants to end Israel's existence and promotes hateful anti-Semitism. To note, the Israel-Palestinian conflict is in Asia, not California. Chapter 2, Page 234, Line 4957: Arab and LGBT citizens have major freedoms in Israel that are denied to them in many Arab and Moslem states. Page 234, Line 4958: The US is working to establish fair and humane policies in order to maintain the borders expected of any sovereign nation. Israel's problem is much worse--they are trying to stop terrorists from entering their country to murder their citizens. Page 237, Lines 5024-5032: "Israel-Palestine" is not the official name of a country. Israel, the official name, is not an Arab country. To note, this region is in Asia, and not California. Page 242, Lines 5157-5161: This narrative assumes the Palestinian view of the 1948 War as factual. There are many perspectives, including that five Arab armies attacked the Jewish state. Significant lands were purchased on the open market long before, and many Arabs were advised by Arab leaders to move out until the war was over.

Page 256, Lines 5477-81: Page 264, Line 5642 through Page 270, Line 5834: There is a poem that harshly treats Israel, without any positive view of Israel or criticism of the self-defeating actions of the corrupt, peace-rejecting Palestinian leaders that the Palestinians have long suffered under. The Introduction says that it aims to "...aid in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism. Based on this objective, it would seem that the 6 million Jews killed by white supremacist-led genocide from the late 1930s to 1945 would merit discussion about the Jewish community. Anti-Semitism is again rising, and there is widespread ignorance about Jews in many California ethnic communities. So, why are Jews excluded from this curriculum? Please add lessons about Jews emigrating to America as a refuge for their ethnic group. Many Jews have found refuge here, including in California, after the Holocaust, or getting illegally kicked out of many Arab countries, or fleeing a sad life in the former Soviet Union. Jew did, and continue to, experience hatred and discrimination, and now more violence and intimidation. Please be unbiased, with accurate history and telling the truth, without resort to academic jargon.
