Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am thoroughly concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Although I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Anti-semitism is on the rise. We need to educate our youth now more than ever. I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address
these concerns.
Thank you, Linda Merry
