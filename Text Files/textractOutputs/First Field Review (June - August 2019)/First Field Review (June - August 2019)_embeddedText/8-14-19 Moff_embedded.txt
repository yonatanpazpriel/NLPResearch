From: Yossi Moff Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Input regarding 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, May 2019 Draft
Dear CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education,
As a 10th grade student in a public high school in California (Aragon High School, San Mateo), I am embarrassed, disgusted, and scared by what the current draft form of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) will mean for my ability to be comfortable in my Jewish identity among my peers, teachers, and community. I admire the goals of learning about other ethnicities and promoting deep and meaningful relationships between students of different cultures and religions that this curriculum purports to encourage. Yet, when I imagine myself being a part of some of this suggested curriculum and seeing my religion completely ignored in the lesson plan and my perspective about Israel's right to exist in peace missing, I would really question whether this curriculum is accomplishing its goal, or if it's doing quite the opposite: furthering racist stereotypes and false histories regarding the Jewish people, our land, and our history.
Helping students appreciate diversity and educating us about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel.
I strongly urge you to remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely, Yossi Moff Sophomore at Aragon High School Foster City, CA
