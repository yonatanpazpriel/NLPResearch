Comment: This introduction emphasizes only one side of the issue and ignores many cultural differences of varied cultures including Asian, Eastern European, , and Middle Eastern. Many of these non-white groups have been very successful and some have even faced some degree of discrimination. They have succeeded in spite of the forces of society.

Chap. 1 Line 42-44:This debt refers to what students of color in the United States are owed after centuries of educational trauma, dehumanization, and enforced sociopolitical, cultural-historical, economic, and moral constraints via the education system

1. Line 300-308: critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, CIS heteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society;

Chapter 2 Paul Rudewicz

Comment: this passage assumes that white supremacy and racism are equivalent to capitalism. This should not be assumed and is erroneous.
Line 87
Some examples of systems of power are: white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy.
Comment: Once again capitalism is presented as equivalent to racism and white supremacy. This is wrong and should not be part of a curriculum presented to K12 of even some College courses.

Description of `Five people I know" Starting on line 502

General Paul Rudewicz

Comment: The five people described are from the ttw 0.5% extremes of the population. The discussion is slanted toward these extreme cases and ignores the middle 99%. What about the African American groups who do succeed at various levels, the doctors, the medical professional, the soldiers who made use of the education benefits. Also what about the Asian and Middle Eastern communities in which the families are more cohesive. There are many more successes than failures that would contribute to your falsely perceived debt due to education gap. Although I believe the history and evolution of cultural and racial groups including their struggles with acceptance into various cities and groups is certainly a very valuable course, this presentation is totally biased and makes assumptions that are not appropriate for presentation to students of any age. Essentially this is liberal propaganda fed directly to our students. This curriculum is typical of the California liberal thinking and I believe is a partial cause of racial strife and emphasis of the negative aspects of racial inequality. A more balanced curriculum which includes some of the negative aspects but also tells some of the positive stories of racial integration and stories of minority groups who have succeeded and what aspects of their lives contributed to their success.
