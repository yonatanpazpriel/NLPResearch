Your Input Template form requires the page number and line number(s) of the original document on which several pages state several ethnic groups that will receive attention in the course. Since no one at the Dept. of Education could give me both a link to the original document and to its index so I could find the problematic references, an employee just told me I could reference the Los Angeles Times article today. Please read on Page 7, left column bottom (to next column top, comments of Williamson Evers, and the last full 1.5 columns in the article including thoughts of the Jewish Caucus in the Legislature. Your several page CDE high school curriculum model for ethnic studies notes the impetus from sixties activism and Third World Liberation Front; it names several specific ethnic groups as having been part of the American fabric, but a victimized part, as needing studying so students can become open minded. It includes Palestinians in this country and the widespread BDS movement against the nation of Israel. Your model distinctly omits antisemitism. However peace may and must be achieved between Palestinians and the Israeli government, the BDS movement's activities in this country and the world, and the bigotry toward others by many, require that Antisemitism be presented also to our high school students as hurtful. The newspaper article brings out the curriculum's apparent preference for teaching about victimization Critical thinking and debate must be aided in the classroom, not merely the beliefs of one minority or another, not what's considered "politically correct." however, is not to be considered among the problems of racism and discrimination. Antisemitism indeed exists as a troubling fact of life, and a cause of murders as well as multitude of harassment and violent incidents. It exists, and it's taught, as a bias. Thank you for improving the curriculum. Had I not retired, I assure you, I would be teaching from it, and I did teach, over 24 years, what I could against bigotry.
