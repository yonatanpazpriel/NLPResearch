From: LAJ Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 10:52 AM To: SBE Subject: Concerned CA Citizen - #4956, #4957, #4958
To Whom it may concern as a citizen of the great state of California. (Los Angles county).
I am extremely concerned about the education curriculum that is very clearly to be Anti-Israel and is really antisemitic. Promotion of the BDS movement and its "education" is dangerous for the Jewish people and clear discrimination of our people. US congress just voted in the same message the previous week.
Education is really the key to make sure that the Holocaust will never happen again. Allowing these three courses into the curriculum of the CA department of education would allow the forces of hate and antisemitism into our school system. This needs to be prevented at all cost.
