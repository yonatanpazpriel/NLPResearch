Very concerned that a curriculum which promotes BDS, bigotry and divisiveness against Israel is even being considered. I request that BDS and other anti-Israel curricula be removed. If the goal is to promote inclusion, then BDS must go. No other state is singled-out like Israel. No critical mention of North Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan or China. Only Israel. Masquerading as human rights advocacy, the goal of BDS is demonization and elimination of the Jewish state. To portray the BDS campaign as politically legitimate is to misunderstand the expressions of anti-Semitism. BDS is the most dangerous form of anti-Semitism today, which is directed against the State of Israel as the living sign of Jewish life in the present and the only refuge for persecuted European Jews. Many thousands of Jews are leaving France and Germany for Israel every year as a safe haven, to escape the Europe aggression of getting beat up as they walk home from school or work. Germany's commissioner on antisemitism Felix Klein recommended that Jews no longer wear symbols of their religion to avoid becoming the target of antisemitic attacks. BDS percolates this hatred. This definition of BDS offers no critical perspectives or that it is even contested. Many scholar believe that this is the most pernicious and unfair movement.

Unbalanced perspective. Teachers should use a poem of harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offers a positive perspective about Israel
Unbalanced perspective. No criticism of Palestinian leaders (Yassir Arafat or Mahmood Abbas) to not negotiate with, or to even counteroffer Israel.
Only the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War is provided, and it is stated as fact, with no alternative perspectives. This is not the mainstream perspective published by the NYT, the BBC, or other mainstream sources. Unclear language implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country, this is categorically wrong.
This is a false equivalence between Israel's wall to prevent terrorists from shooting and stabbing innocents, and U.S. policy to reduce illegal immigration.
Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group, but provides no alternate perspective, such as from the well-noted and highly-respected Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME). Please allow SPME to comment.
