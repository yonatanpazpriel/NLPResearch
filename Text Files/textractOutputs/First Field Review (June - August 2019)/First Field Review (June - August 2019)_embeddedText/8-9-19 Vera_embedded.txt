From: Camelia Vera Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 9:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on Ethnic studies
It is imperative that a course on ethnic studies include studying about the holocaust and anti-semitism.
Currently the curriculum is incomplete without covering this important topic. I respectfully request that it be revised to be included.
Thank you, Camelia Vera San Gabriel, CA 91775
