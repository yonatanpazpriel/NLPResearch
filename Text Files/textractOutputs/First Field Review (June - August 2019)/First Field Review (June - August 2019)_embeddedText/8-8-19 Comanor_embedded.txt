From: William Comanor Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 5:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am aghast at the model curriculum. As an educator and professor at the University of California, this is precisely the type of material our students do not need. Understanding societal issues is difficult enough without being presented with one-sided, overly simplistic descriptions; which is what the current version of the ESMC does. What is striking is that it promotes a viewpoint that is contrary to California law.
In my judgment, this proposed curriculum encourages prejudice rather than helps alleviate it, and should not be adopted without major changes.
