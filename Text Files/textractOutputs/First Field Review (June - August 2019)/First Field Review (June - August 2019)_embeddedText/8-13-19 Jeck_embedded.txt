Glossary/Summary Rachael Jeck, private citizen

Page 2 of the glossary has a definition for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) that
is one-sided and misleading. It does not acknowledge the anti-semitic, and often violent/threatening
nature of the BDS movement. I believe that BDS is being presented in a positive light and identifies Israel as the enemy/oppressor. This presentation of BDS a) ignores the reality of the movment's objective which is to do away with Israel as the Jews' homeland and b) fails to acknowledge or even explore the opposite point of view (Israel's reality living alongside a people (the Palestinians) whose leadership refuses to accept their right to exist and whose goal is to destroy them. There are many who have written about BDS
and what its true goals are. Here is just one example, "BDS organizers hope to bring their own vision of justice to the region. It is a vision that doesn't include the State of Israel in its viewfinder.BDS leaders use the rhetoric of religious and moral authority to condemn Israel in sermons, essays, press releases, reports, and other publications. Palestinians are portrayed as the weak, oppressed people who must be defended against Israel's bullying and injustice. These antiIsrael sentiments are used to mask anti-Semitic attitudes." In fact, BDS employs some of the same tactics that Pres. Trump does. While President Trump says he is not a racist, he uses language that breeds hate and divisiveness. BDS does the same. While BDS tries to fashion itself like the anti-apartheid movement and Black Lives Matter. It is not the same. There are Palestinians who are living in horrible conditions. The Israeli government and Palestinian leaders should work together to fix that. However, unlike the black people living in apartheid Africa, the Palestinians are not simply victims of Israeli oppression. To the contrary, the Palestinian leadership has refused to accept the validity of Israel as

the homeland for the Jewish people and has dedicated itself to the eradication of the Jewish people. The other side of the story (the Jewish experience) must be told in any teaching about BDS and the Palestinian experience.
Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269. I am deeply disturbed by the fact that the ethnic studies curriculum does not include nor define anti-semitism. American Jews were/are immigrants and have faced discrimination and harassment because of their religion and cultural identities in America for decades, if not centuries. The history of the Klu Klux Klan and the rise of white supremacy (especially in today's world) present the very same challenges (and threats) to Jews here in America that other ethnic minorities face. I am Jewish. I am so pleased to see that the ethnic studies materials address Islamophobia and the Muslim experience here in America. I believe in diversity and understanding. However, I feel that the blatant omission of anti-semitism and failure to include the Jewish experience in the context of this course material is a glaring oversight, at best, and is counter to the objective of these learning materials. If CA is going to embark upon a mandatory curriculum in ethnic studies, the experience of Jews in America must be included.
