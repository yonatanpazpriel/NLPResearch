From: Frank Giffen Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I read with great dismay the letter sent to you by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus. If what they say is accurate, and I have no reason to believe it is not, the proposed curriculum does a huge disservice to both our Jewish community and any students who follow this course of study. Erasing the American Jewish experience, omitting any discussion of the presence and prevalence of antisemitism in this country, and discussing the Israeli/Palestinian conflict with clear one-sidedness, is unfair, inaccurate, and just plain wrong. I urge you to revise this proposed curriculum to include a fair discussion of the Jewish people before you adopt it, lest it be another misleading, inaccurate piece of "education" taught to California students. There has been too much of that over the years, and we should all be smart enough to keep it from happening again. Thank you,
Frank Giffen
