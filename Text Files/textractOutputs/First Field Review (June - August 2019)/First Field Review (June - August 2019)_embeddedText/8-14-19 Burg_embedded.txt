Ladies and Gentlemen:
As a lifelong Californian, I am APPALLED by the Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
It is bad enough that, rather than fostering social cohesion by teaching our nation's shared values � through traditional civics education � the Department of Education seeks to inflame ethnic, racial, and gender balkanization by indoctrinating our young people with leftist grievance politics. This is NOT the proper role of our public education system!
Even worse, however, is the blatantly anti-Israel � and thus inherently anti-Semitic � animus of your disgusting proposed curriculum. The political issues surrounding the decades-long Israeli-Arab conflict are complex � and certainly are worthy of even-handed, objective exploration in political science and history courses � but it is utterly OUTRAGEOUS that our Department of Education would seek to propagandize students in favor of those who seek to destroy the world's only Jewish state through this absurd "ethnic studies" mandate.
SHAME ON YOU!!
Sincerely,
David L. Burg
