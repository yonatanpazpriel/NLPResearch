Overall, Korean Americans are underrepresented throughout this draft even though they make up a significant portion of California's diverse demographics. It seems Koreans are incorporated with Chinese or Japanese American history whereas the other two groups are distinctly represented.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards California's intellectual investment in the Ethnic Studies to bring more people's history into K-12 curriculum and beyond. As a recent immigrant and a history teacher at a California's public school, I have always acknowledged the desperate need of the official state mandated guidelines for this area. However, I felt that my ethnicity, Korean, was underrepresented and misunderstood even though we make up a significant portion of California's diverse demographics.
