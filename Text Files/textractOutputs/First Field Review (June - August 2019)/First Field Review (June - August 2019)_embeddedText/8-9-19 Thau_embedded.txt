From: Robert Thau Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed ethnic studies curriculum is deeply flawed
I am shocked and dismayed that the proposed California curriculum on ethnic studies has made it this far in its oppressively flawed approach, especially toward the Jewish community. A few examples:
In defining various forms of racism including trans-phobia, Islamophobia, homophobia, xenophobia, sexism, and white supremacy - guess what's left out ï¿½ antisemitism - oh my God - despite that over the last few years (indeed over the millennia) there have been more antisemitic acts in the United States and internationally than against any other group, ethnicity, race or religion.
What an incredible - no blatant - "oversight."
I didn't see any mention of the Holocaust or Holocaust denial.
And the definition of the BDS movement is so one-sided and oppressive as to be ludicrous:
BDS is the tipping point of a global campaign to demonize, weaken and ultimately do away with Israel, the Jewish state. The fundamental anti-Semitism of BDS has been called out by many countries internationally as well as by substantial majorities of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress.
Moreover, what does BDS have to do with ethnic studies anyway. It is at best a political movement and there are certainly at least two sides to the story regarding its founding, intent and efficacy. Yet the proposed curriculum includes it showing just one side of the issue.
Looking forward to some substantial revisions of this proposed curriculum.
As a resident of California for over 75 years, a Democrat, a proponent of ethnic studies and a member of the Jewish community, this can't represent the California that I know and love.
