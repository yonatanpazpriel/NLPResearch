From: Arthur Bobrove Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I support the idea of teaching of an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the ESMC, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
The ESMC does not address the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools. This is shocking, especially with the resurgence in antisemitism that we are witnessing in America.
Our family is personally offended by the one-sided BDS bias and the demonization of Israel, as my sonin- law is an Israeli-American and the father of our two young grandsons, who attend public school in Palo Alto. We urge you make every effort to avoid any type of bias in the ESMC.
I urge you to consider our concerns in order to assure that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum does indeed promote better understanding, acceptance and diversity and precludes potentially unanticipated rejection of any ethnic group. . Thank you,
Arthur M. Bobrove, MD
