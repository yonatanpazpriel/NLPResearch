I am totally against this new government addition to California Public Schools and Universities called Ethnic Studies I find that it leaves too much open for opinions by the professors and teachers that give rise to antisemitism and stimulate very biased and false views regarding Judaism and Israel Plus labeling instead of tolerance I think The whole idea is unconstitutional
