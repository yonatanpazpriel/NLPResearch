From: Kathy Lund Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:50 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: General comments
I strongly oppose the adoption of this proposal in Ethnic Studies for the reasons noted below:
> puts forth changes to the word "history" to "hxrstory", (unnecessary > and silly); States an *opinion* that Capitalism is racist; States > another *opinion* that the Founding Fathers were all racist; it > supports the ridiculous notion that teachers have as much to learn > from students as the other way around and they are to be "co-constructors of knowledge"; and It contains Anti Semantic language throughout.
Serious changes need to be made to transition this proposal from opinion and indoctrination to solid pedagogy.
