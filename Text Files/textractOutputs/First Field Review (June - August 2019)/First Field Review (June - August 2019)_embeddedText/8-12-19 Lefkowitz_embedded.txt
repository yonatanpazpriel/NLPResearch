From: Ellen Lefkowitz Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 8:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Regarding California's new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I was raised here in California and very much value my public school education as well as my education at the University of California where I took many Ethnic Studies classes that gave me a much deeper understanding of the world that we live in with all of its complexities. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Now as a mother of a child going through our public schools, I want to make sure that she and all of our students are receiving a balanced education that is representative of the complex and diverse world that we all share. I am asking you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Ellen Lefkowitz, mother of a 6 year old Alameda, CA
