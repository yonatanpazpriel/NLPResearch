From: Daphne M Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 5:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerned Citizen - Your Proposed Curriculum
To the California Department of Education and Instructional Quality Commission, I'm a proud Israeli-American, and upon reading your proposed curriculum � I am extremely worried. Safety has always been a big issue in my life as an Israeli. I had my first panic attack over the security situation at the age of seven. When I was merely 14, I was extremely traumatized by the Dolphin Reef terror attack, which left 21 Israelis dead � many of whom were as young as I was. My 82-year-old grandmother lives in the city of Ashkelon. She has less than 30 seconds to run into a shelter in the middle of her street should a missile be targeted at her town. This unimaginable reality has increasingly happened in the past years. Needless to say, when the sirens go off, she stays put and simply prays. As a child, I was taught that when traveling abroad � one should not speak Hebrew in public or wear clothes with Hebrew on them. Even necklaces with the Star of David seemed like a risky choice. I was literally taught that it would be advisable to hide who I am outside the borders of Israel, out of concern of having my security compromised. The United States felt like the only exception to this rule. I felt like I was safe here. Until recently. With the amount of anti-Semitic attacks this country has seen this past year � from the shootings in the temples at Pittsburgh and Poway to swastikas spray-painted in a Brooklyn playground this past February � it is clear that Jewish people are a targeted minority. Including sessions about the BDS in your curriculum will further compromise my safety, and even more so � the safety of the young Israeli-American and Jewish students who go to your schools. Furthermore, ignoring the fact that Jewish people and Israelis are prosecuted creates a very harmful, illegitimate narrative of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The BDS Movement purposefully uses misinformation to promote hatred and discrimination against Israel on the basis of national and ethnic origin. Educating young students that this is a peaceful freedom movement is completely inaccurate; Omar Barghouti, the founder of the BDS Movement, repeatedly spoke about its goal as ending the Jewish nation's sovereignty in Israel. Further, the Hamas terrorist group was involved in its formation. This image, captured at border riots earlier this month, unfortunately captures the essence of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict:

I cannot begin to describe how disturbing this image is to me, as a Jewish woman who has ancestors who perished in the Holocaust. Please keep your Israeli-American and Jewish students safe from the discrimination that would further arise if the BDS' inaccurate rhetoric would be spread in schools.
Sincerely,
Daphne Macy
