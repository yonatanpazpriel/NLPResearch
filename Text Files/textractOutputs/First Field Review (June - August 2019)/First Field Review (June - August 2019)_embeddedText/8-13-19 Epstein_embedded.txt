From: Jill Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am disturbed and deeply disappointed by the model curriculum currently being reviewed by The State of California, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am appalled that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism.
As a parent, an attorney, a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division.
