Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] I agree with the California State Board of Education statement dated August 12, 2019 that the ESMC needs to be "free of bias" and "appropriate for all learners" and that the current draft "falls short and needs to be substantially redesigned." I also agree with the comments of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus dated July 29, 2019. As I paged through the Glossary and the EMSC Sample Course Materials, I was returned to my childhood over fifty years ago as a Jewish public school student and the anti-Semitism, both explicit and implicit, I had experienced in various schools in the San Fernando Valley, including from teachers. In my opinion, the EMSC would again marginalize Jewish students by denying through its silence (and by comparison the extensive and often biased depiction of the experiences of groups other than Jews), the experience of Jews in America, including our State of California. I would not want my grandchildren to be subjected to the implicit prejudice and pain that these selective course materials would inflict. Some additional comments related to specific pages are below

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
There is no definition of "Anti-Semitism" (in contrast to Islamophobia, page 10). I found only one reference to "anti-Semitism" in entire document. Given the history of Anti-Semitism in America, and its negative effects, this demonstrates a lack of fairness and balance in the EMSC. Glossary, P.1 & Chapter 2, Sample Course Materials, p.10, line 239 and p. 289, line 6238 There is a definition of BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) and several references to BDS, as well politically biased comments about the founding of Israel, that I perceive as politically biased. This is especially so, in that I did not find any other Country similarly mentioned or commented on in the ESMC. (Given the experiences of my Armenian friends, Turkey, among many others, would quickly come to mind if fairness and balance were reflected in the ESMC, which they are not.) Glossary: P.2, lines 30-40 & Chapter 2, Sample Course Materials, p. 35, line 684 and 234, line 4957. See also pps. 234, 237, 242 (lines 5157-5161), 256, and 268-69 (lines 5802-5803). The sample lesson 1, U.S. Housing Inequality: Redlining and Racial Housing Covenants, is just another example of the implicit bias in the ESMC. It focuses on "African Americans, as well as other people of color", but leaves out the similar experiences of other groups, including Jews, who were subjected to "redlining," and religious and "racial housing covenants." Students should learn that these restrictive and discriminatory real estate practices were not only directed at people or color, but go back a long time and applied as well to other groups. Imagine my horror when I saw a covenant barring Jews from ownership in the real estate documents of a property that my wife and I purchased. That and similar experiences are part of the larger story of America, including California, that need to be told so that our students find common ground.
