GAIL DEMARIO

The proposed curriculum doesn't include Jews although they have historically been the most persecuted minority. I propose including Jews' experiences might begin to do away with blatant anti-Semitism based on pre-supposed ideas about Jews. All over the world Jews have experienced extermination, lack of access to land, education & travel along with deportation & confiscation of belongings. My own experiences with LAUSD have made me think that the educators and curriculum planners should also learn about Jews. The principal of Hale Jr. High said to me that, "another pushy Jewish mother thought her kid was gifted." He didn't know I was Jewish. And that wasn't my only experience. I volunteered & then taught Bi-lingual in the 80's - 90's and found no prejudice or ugliness among the students. It all came from Administration and teachers. I believe the most important thing school can do is remove the division of students according to race, ethnicity, income and/or politics. I believe it is vitally important to allow children to develop friendships and relationships naturally rather than the constantly pointing out of differences according to color, race, ethnicity, etc. My daughter was completely unaware of the differences among her friends. She was far more concerned with trying to understand Algebra. We need to spend less time on gender i.d. and racial i.d. and more time on Math, Science and the Arts. I hope my comments will be taken seriously since I spent all the years my daughter was in school volunteering or teaching. My opinions are based on years of experience.
