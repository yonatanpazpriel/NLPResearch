Let me start by apologizing for the haste I've written this. I didn't realize this was happening until this morning when I read about it in the Los Angeles Times.

I wanted to share my feelings on the current Ethnic Studies Draft. In the early 90s, while I was attending CSUN as an Anthropology major, I remember the upper echelon wanted to do something similar. I always thought it was a good idea, but what was the goal behind it? Were they attempting to introduce other world views to the white student majority with the purpose of students becoming more empathetic or for other reasons? As an Anthropology major I worried that someone taking an ethnic studies class about a culture they were not associated with might have the exact opposite effect and make the student more entrenched in their beliefs. I do realize that part of your mission is to bring minorities to the forefront, where they definitely should be, so we all can learn what their history has to tell. Kudo's to you all for doing this. I do have concerns.

I am concerned that nothing is noted about the Jewish history in America and about anti-Semitism. Most people raised in the United States have no idea that the Jewish people have been here from nearly the beginning of colonization. This definitely needs to be addressed.

While attending CSUN I took a wonderful course called Intercultural Communication. This is the course that I felt all students should need to take. It is the perfect class to pull everything together that you are trying to do. Where some of the criticism is about the divisive ethnic studies bring to the table you can rebuttal this criticism by showing your critics how you would bring everyone back to together as a community. Please give it some thought. The three texts I still have that you may still be able to find are: Communicating With Strangers, Gudykunst, W. & Yun Kim, Y. ; Intercultural Communication, Samovar L. & Porter, R.; Cultural Communication and Intercultural Contact Carbaugh, D. Ed.
