Education is critical to the success and shaping of society. Randomized unbiased studies can provide valuable information but learning from anecdotal information based on experience is most valuable. Children should be taught to dream and learn to love to be educated to prepare them for the ever growing competitive society that exists. This has nothing to do with the color of the skin or ethnicity. After many years of higher education and experiencing education on many levels, I do know one thing. Unfortunately education opportunities exist for some based on ethnicity.
