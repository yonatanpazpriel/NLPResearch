Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board Of Education,
I am very concerned about the flawed, unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the teaching of an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Jews have been excluded as an ethnic group even though anti-semitism has been the target of half of the religious based hate crimes in get U.S. The BDS movement is included with no balancing perspective, and a song with language that suggest Jews control the media is included.
Despite the significant contributions of Jew to California's history, politics, culture, and government-and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination-the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and insistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
Sincerely, Judy Aptekar
