From: Sandy Shanin Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear CDE, IQC, AND STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION
I am a parent as well as an educator. I strongly urge you to remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. I also urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the middle east and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union.
Thank you,
