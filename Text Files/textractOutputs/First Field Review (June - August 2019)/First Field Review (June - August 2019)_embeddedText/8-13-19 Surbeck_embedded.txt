From: J.J. Surbeck Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:19 PM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: RE: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Mr. McDonald,
As California resident and community member, I am very alarmed and deeply concerned about the California Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
The proposed coursework as it is written, and contrary to what its proponents claim, will turn California classrooms into discriminatory and hostile environments for the young people in our community. This curriculum endorses prejudice against Jewish, Israeli-American and Zionist students, and delegitimizes their heritage and identity. It will lead to harassment, bullying, and discrimination.
This deeply biased curriculum has no place in our public schools, which should be forums for teaching respectful dialogue, understanding, and tolerance.
I ask that you put a hold on the currently proposed curriculum, and meet our community leaders to discuss how to improve this shameful and disturbingly biased coursework.
Thank you
J.J. Surbeck San Francisco
