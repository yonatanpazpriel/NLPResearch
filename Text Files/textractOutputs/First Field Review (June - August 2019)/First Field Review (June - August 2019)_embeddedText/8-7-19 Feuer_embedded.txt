Page 2 lines 30 � 40. The definition of BDS plainly accepts Israel is a villainous country breaking international law without an different perspective or debate. This is biased and does not promote understanding, examination of critical issues, or nuance. It is racist on its face. Its entry in a glossary presents it as a fact. I suggest removal of the entire section. Israel is not presented as an independent nation which it is. It is lumped together with the Palestinians. This is not factual and resembles some Arab nation's policies to treat Israel as if it does not exist.
The song presented is negative to America. There are those who feel America is bad and their perspective is legitimate but at the same time there are other perspectives that are not presented. I advocate a more balanced approach than presenting one side to children.

The curriculum presents many forms of oppression and condemnation of oppressors but none about Jews or Israel. An approach that focuses on only certain ethnicities or nationalities suffering at the hands of brutality it is biased and incomplete. It will foment hatred and reduce cross-cultural understanding. The plan should be expanded to include Jews murdered during the holocaust; Jewish persecution in the former Soviet Union; terrorism against Jews in modern-day South America and Europe and the US (such as the recent Pittsburgh synagogue shooting); Wars of hatred and extermination against Israel; Hate speech against Israel by her neighboring countries; Singling out for intense focus and criticism of Israel by the United Nations; and so on.
