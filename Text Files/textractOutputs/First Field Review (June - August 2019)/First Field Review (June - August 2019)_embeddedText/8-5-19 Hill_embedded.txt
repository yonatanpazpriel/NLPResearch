Pg. 13, 306-308; listing patriarchy and cisheteropatriarchy as a form of power and oppression is a direct attack on certain cultures. Also stating capitalism as a form of oppression is absurd. Pg. 2, 30-40; This is nothing more than an attack on Israel. There never was a Palestine and Israel was created by the United Nations. This is nothing more than a course for indoctrination and socialism.
