p.3 line 76 White Supremacy is listed as a key principle. The word Privilege might be more accurate as I see that you do address privilege in the sample content. There is an historical value to introducing the phrase "White Supremacy" and perhaps that will lead to discussions of privilege, but because the word "privilege" is au courant it might be more effective to address that language directly.

This is an ambitious set of documents. I am concerned that it is too emotionally charged to be implemented in the underserved school districts that would benefit most from it. I like the series of feedback loops built into the sample content and emotional responses might be exorcised through them. However, in reality, We � as a nation- do not prepare our teachers for the emotional workload they encounter in their classrooms and I would fully understand if they saw this as just too hot to handle. This curriculum requires teachers that are differently prepared.

My work currently focuses on curriculum that would allow our EPPs to produce Emotionally Response-Able teachers. Until this happens the majority of our k-12 teachers will avoid this curriculum like the plague. And, who could blame them?

I'm also concerned that grades 9-10 maybe just simply out of reach based on developmental psychologies.
