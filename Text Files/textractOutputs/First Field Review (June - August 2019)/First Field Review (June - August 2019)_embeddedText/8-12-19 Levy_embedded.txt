From: leland.levy Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:
This is to convey my concern about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that is being considered for adoption. While I support ethnic studies, I believe major revisions are in order in the current draft.
Please do not allow it implementation without responding to the many criticisms of it as it now stands.
Sincerely,
Le
