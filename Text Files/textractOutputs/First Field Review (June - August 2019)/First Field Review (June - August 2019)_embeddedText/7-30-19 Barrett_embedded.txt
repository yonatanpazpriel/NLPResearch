I am shocked at the assumptions underpinning these guidelines, outlines and materials. The underlying message is that white people, capitalism and democracy are oppressive and bad. It is very racist to put all "whites" into an oppressive class against "people of color". We need to get away from racist divisiveness. You don't cure or inform a wrong with more of the same wrong to a different group. Almost the whole suggested curriculum is a hodge podge of the latest version of activist political opposition to any one and anything connected to the white race. It has no place in education that needs to be for everyone, including those who don't agree with such political positions. Practically the whole curriculum as drafted is divisive and reflects political views of one group, not educational information on the ethnic history, experience and diversity in this country. There is no area devoted to how people of color have been able to rise and succeed in this country, have a voice and a vote, especially as contrasted against many of the countries where they or their ancestors came from, which truly are very oppressive. The United States is one of the least oppressive countries in the world, and getting better not worse. Where is that message in all of this hateful attack on whites, capitalism and democracy?? I think you should throw the whole piece of garbage out. Please stop trying to brainwash kids into a political viewpoint and teach them in a colorblind way.
