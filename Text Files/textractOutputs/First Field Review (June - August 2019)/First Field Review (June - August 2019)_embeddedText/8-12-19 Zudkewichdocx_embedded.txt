From: Ari Zudkewich Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 12:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Extremely disappointed by this new curriculum
After reading through the proposed curriculum, I cannot fathom what would possess you to create such an anti-Jewish, one-sided position on Israel that you plan to actually TEACH. You have an opportunity to correct the marginalization of a group that is represented as .02% of the world population, yet 50% of hate crimes in the United States. As a Jew and a Californian, I am appalled. I urge you to reconsider this horrific new curriculum, which holds a lot of similarities to the curriculum of the Nazis in the late `30s and early `40s.
