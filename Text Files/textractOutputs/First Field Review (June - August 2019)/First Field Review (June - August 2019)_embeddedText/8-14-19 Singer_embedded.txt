Thank you for listening to public comment and deciding to completely revise the ESMC.
I hope that you will consider my comments in redesigning the curriculum so that the new ESMC will meet its goal to "prepare pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures". To attain this goal, the redesigned curriculum should include:
� a discussion of Jews as an ethnic group, � a discussion of and examples of the American Jewish experience and the
experience of Jews in California, � contributions of American Jews and California Jews, � a discussion of the role of Jews in social justice movements and Jewish efforts to
combat prejudice including the civil rights movement, � a discussion of anti-Semitism as a form of bias and prejudice and the fact that it
is on the rise, and � if the Israelian-Palestinian conflict and the BDS movement are to be addressed, a
discussion of the highly complex and disputed conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people where the values behind all sides of the conflict are fully represented and addressed in a way that seeks to promote understanding, peace, critical thinking, creative solutions, and empathy and does not create a hostile environment for anyone or support any particular viewpoint.

I support and draw your attention to the detailed comments submitted by the Institute for Curriculum Services and the Jewish Public Affairs Committee, as well as by Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa and the Legislative Jewish and LGBT caucuses.and the concerns shared by these broad-based and diverse groups.

Of particular concern in the draft that was discarded are pages 1-2 of the Glossary where anti-Semitism is excluded and the one-sided definition of BDS. Also pages 234,237, 242, 256 and 264-269 where Palestinian "border" issues are discussed. While the Israel/Palestinian issue is a source of conflict and a terrible problem, the text as presented here is totally one sided and will not lead to the goal of understanding, peace, empathy, critical thinking, or creative solutions.

California students deserve the best education possible, and will benefit from an ethnic studies program whose goal is to alleviate prejudice and bigotry and supports inclusion, empathy, and critical thinking. I hope that my letter, along with the collective voice you are hearing from Californians, will help the Commission to reflect on the deep flaws of the draft and help you to develop a curriculum that meets the Commission's own standards of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations and the EMSC goal: to "prepare pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures".

Thank you for your consideration.
