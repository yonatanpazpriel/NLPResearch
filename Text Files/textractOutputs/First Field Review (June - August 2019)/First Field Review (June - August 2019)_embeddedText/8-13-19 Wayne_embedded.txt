After reviewing this document I would suggest that this one sided material be presented to college level students only, as an elective, if at all.?? If this type of material is to be presented it should be presented with unbiased facts not with the political correct made up words that lead to confusion and hate.?? It is understandable why so many of our companies and people are leaving this state with the educational system so against capitalism, the hand that has feed them.?? It is true that this country will fall from within and soon will suffer the same fate as Venezuela.?? We need to teach our students the skills of critical thinking, along with the basic skills of reading writing, math and history (not currently revised history).
Thank you
