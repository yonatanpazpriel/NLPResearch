Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply concerned by the proposed, and seemingly one-sided, Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
The imbalance in the proposal seems to ignore the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culter and government, and importantly our (seemingly unending) struggle against hatred and discrimination. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. The lack of balanced education is (in my mind) a root cause of much of the bigotry we see today.
Please substantially revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
