I am a credentialed school teacher and I believe that this curriculum is more liberal indoctrination that does not represent the view of all Americans and I realize this is just California but whatever you do in California spreads to the rest of the country. So far many people are leaving the public school system due to your liberal decisions especially in a sexual Ed curriculum. I strongly suggest you change this study to represent All views about overpopulation and many other narrow liberal views included. There is no choice for the conservative population that does not believe what this curriculum teaches to be true. If your objective is to drive more families out of the school system into the private sector then you will accomplish that with this liberal curriculum.
