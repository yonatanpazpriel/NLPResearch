To who it may concern, The proposed "Ethnic Studies curriculum", to be mandated to be taught in our CA public schools, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry is not appropriate, and NOT an accurate representation of certain "marginalized persons".
The content will turn classrooms into places of hate in the State of CA, our communities, and families. We are incredibly concerned for the welfare of our students!!! Beyond the personal impact, the content will have a chilling effect on raising our children and future generations with these hateful views.
This curriculum should not be approved. Thank you, Carrie Hobson
