Comment (include page and line numbers
Chapter 1, Page 2: Lines 27-31. The omission of of Anti-Semitism clearly shows that the drafters of this curriculum are "Anti-Semites" They hate the Jewish People. They hate the Jewish Religion They are eliminating Jews from history and furthering the efforts of Adolph Hitler. California deserves better! They have no business drafting this curriculum. If the State of California approves this, they are endorsing Anti-Semitism. You should be completely embarrassed and this project should be scrapped.
