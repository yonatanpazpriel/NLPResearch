Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
By choosing to proceed through these legislative changes during the summertime, the state of California does not grant the public (especially school districts) an opportunity to discuss. In order to ensure each member of California's educational system has time to read and review this proposed change, the state must delay the deadline for comment. It is critical that the voices of community members are heard. As a student, this proposal will affect me personally. It is in the best interest of the members of my community that the deadline is pushed back. The current deadline is pushing school districts into a corner with minimal time to discuss and comment on a subject that is important to each and every school district throughout the state.
