The curriculum does not include a single lesson on Jews, ignores anti-Semitism (despite the fact that it is increasing), and takes a Pro-Palestinian viewpoint instead of providing both sides of the story. Additionally, many facts are simply ignored to push a political agenda, which is NOT what we should be doing in public schools. It's cruelly ironic that curriculum is meant to educate and reduce bias actually promotes it! Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (which is anti-Semitic!)
Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Additionally, countries like Egypt maintain a blockade of Gaza for their own security � not mentioned (again to push a political agenda, not to educate. Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. This included perspective is not a factual representation of the events.
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. Again, this just ignores facts.
Notes that the goal of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" without clarifying that Palestinians DO NOT live in apartheid. Also, missing is a note that the actual goal of BDS is to end the existence of the State of Israel. (more anti-Semitism)
