From: kestrin Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 3:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public feedback on Ethnic Studies
This curriculum neglects the Sikhs, the Hindus, the Jews. and many other religious and ethnic minorities. What makes some cultures worthy of study, while others are not? Rather than inform and enlighten, some of the extremist language in this proposed curriculum may have the opposite effect- serving to isolate and demonize.
I don't support this proposed curriculum.
