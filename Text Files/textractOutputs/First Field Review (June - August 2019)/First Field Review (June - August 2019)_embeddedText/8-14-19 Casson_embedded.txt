From: Ed Casson Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: objections to ethnic studies
I have read some of the proposed curriculum for the proposed ethnic studies course. I object to the ways the curriculum is politically biased in favor of Politically Correct thought and leftist jargon. In particular I am objecting to the indifference and hostility to American Jews as expressed or not expressed in the document. I am a life-long Democratic voter and not some kind of Trump-ite.
