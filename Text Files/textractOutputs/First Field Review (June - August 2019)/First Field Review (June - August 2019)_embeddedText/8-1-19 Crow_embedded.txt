You've got to be kidding me. Who was in charge of this trash? Your Socialist leanings come through loud and clear. Why not go ahead and put this forth as a Progressive Agenda, along with the pathetic AOC, New Green Deal. America provides the most opportunity for anyone to achieve whatever they want and have the guts, brains and desire to accomplish. When will you quit trying to re-educate our children and instead provide information that is un-biased? Teach children how to think, bring back vocational classes, understand that not everyone should go to college. Provide complex problems and let the kids figure it out. Adults have screwed up enough kids. Let them alone to find their own path. They don't need this type of pathetic attempt to screw up their futures.
