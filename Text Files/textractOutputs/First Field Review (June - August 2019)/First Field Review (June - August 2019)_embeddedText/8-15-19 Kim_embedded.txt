[Appendices page 7 Unit 2, Line 240: Immigration, Migration, and Movement- Suggestion to include Korean American Immigration History: Since their immigration to United States in 1903, Korean Americans have become a thriving part of the nation's progress and prosperity, serving as a significant mediator for the strong economic, political, and cultural alliance between United States and Korea. With the recognition of proud Korean Heritage Korean Americans, such as US Army officer Young Oak Kim, Olympic gold medalist Sammy Lee, and the contributions that Korean American community has made in California and United States, the 109th Congress of the United States of America passed a resolution on December 2005, commemorating January 13th as the "Korean American Day". Today, after more than 100 years since the arrival of the Korean pioneer immigrants, Korean Americans comprise the largest population of the East Asian ethnic group and the strongest community in California, with the thriving culture in the heart of Los Angeles, known as Koreatown.]

How does law and language affect generational differences? In this unit, students will compare and evaluate oral histories as an alternative to mainstream media's representation of ethnicity by conducting their own oral history research. Students will first understand the differences and similarities different groups experiences and build empathy and understanding of various experiences from World War II (A Different Mirror Chapter 14). Students will evaluate the language that was used in history for different laws and legal outcomes for various ethnic groups in the U.S. In this process, students will explore the relationships between previous generations and their modern generation by reading the chapter and writing a diary entry for each sub-section in the chapter (6 total: Japanese Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Jewish Americans) from the perspective of a person of that group during that time period.  add Korean Americans

Please add Korean American Immigration history:
The immigration of Koreans can be largely divided into three periods: the first wave from 1903 to 1949, the second wave from 1950 to 1964, and the contemporary period. The first significant wave of immigration started on January 13, 1903, when a shipload of Korean immigrants arrived in Hawaii to work on pineapple and sugar plantations. By 1905, more than 7,226 Koreans had come to Hawaii (637 women; 465 children) to escape the famines and turbulent political climate of Korea. When Hawaii was annexed by the United States in 1898, the plantation owners in Hawaii needed cheap labor and recruited the first influx of immigrant labor from Canton, China. When the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 banned the workers from recruiting Chinese laborers, the U.S. diplomat and Presbyterian missionary Horace Allen started to recruit Korean laborers. That group of Korean immigrants established the first Korean Methodist Church in Honolulu. Korean immigrant churches functioned as a cultural and religious asylum where the immigrants, isolated due to their language and cultural barriers, found comfort. When the plantation labor contract expired, around 50% of Korean workers moved to the mainland and established self-employed businesses such as laundry stores and nail salons; the other half returned to Korea due to various reasons, including familial reasons and difficulty associated with adjusting to a foreign culture.

Immediately after Korea was liberated from Japan's annexation in 1945, Korea became a battleground in the U.S and Soviet Union's power struggle. In 1948, Korea was divided into two political entities--South Korea supported by the United States and a communist government in North Korea supported by the Soviet Union. During the Korean War (1950-1953), the second wave of Korean immigrants moved to America. What started as an ideological conflict in the Cold War period became a national calamity killing nearly 55,000 people. During this period, approximately 15,000 Koreans immigrated to the United States. The McCarran and Walter Act of 1952 nullified the Asian immigration ban and made Asian immigrants eligible for citizenship. The second wave consisted of three

groups: Korean wives of American soldiers, known as war brides; war orphans adopted by American families; and around 27,000 people composed of students, businessmen, and intellectuals. The War Bride Act of 1946 facilitated the immigration of Korean wives of American servicemen. The war brides, like the first wave of Korean immigrants, suffered from alienation and the cultural barrier. They were isolated from both Korean and American communities because most were required to stay on military bases or in military facilities. The second group of immigrants were adopted Korean children of mixed ethnic descent. These "GI babies"--fathered by American servicemen--experienced a triple stigma: they were mixed-race, they were fatherless, and their mothers were treated as prostitutes who had borne racially "impure" babies. Among adopted Korean babies, 41 percent were "full-blooded" Koreans, 46 percent had Caucasian fathers, and the rest were African-Koreans.

The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act revoked the national quota system and made family reunification possible. Recognizing America's need for skilled professionals, the government lifted the quota system and recruited experts and professionals from Asia. Their families accompanied them upon emigration. The annual number of Korean immigrants steadily increased beginning in 1965, and the 30,000 mark was reached in 1976. From 1976 to 1990, the Korean diaspora community was the largest group of immigrants to move to the U.S., next to the Mexican and the Filipino community. The high unemployment rate, political insecurity, and military dictatorship caused massive numbers of Koreans to immigrate to the United States in the 1960s through the early 1980s. Their children, largely known as the "second generation," (gyopo in Korean) compose the present-day Korean-American community. Unlike the first and second wave of immigrants who were primarily laborers, war victims, or political refugees who had no choice but to immigrate, these Korean immigrants were white-collar workers in Korea who voluntarily moved to America.
