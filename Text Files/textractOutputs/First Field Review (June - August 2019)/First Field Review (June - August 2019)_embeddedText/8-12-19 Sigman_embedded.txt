To whom it may concern,
Please find attached the public comment form.
The section on Arab Americans is quite distressing and appears to be the work of bigots who may be antisemitic but certainly hate Israel. Specifically:
4967- The executive order did not mention Muslims, Islam, nor Arabs. Calling it a "Muslim ban" is pejorative.
4972 � Other than political, there is no similarity to the treatment of African Americans in the US and the treatment of Arabs in Israel. The "Palestinian" movement attached itself to "BLM" as an opportunistic moment. There is a quid pro quo and that is BLM support for the "Palestinian" cause by including a screed against Israel in their manifesto. They falsely accuse Israel of being an Apartheid regime and committing genocide. They justify their claim by utilizing political propaganda.
4973 � The call to boycott Israel is inherently antisemitic as the BDS goal is the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state.
4974 � There is no comparison between the situation at the Mexican border, wherein economic migrants seek to enter the US for a better life for themselves and their children and the "Palestinian" attempt to violate the Israeli border for the sake of murdering Israelis.
4986 � Linda Sarsour is a noted activist who promotes antisemitism, makes misogynistic comments about women who disagree with her, and publicly admires noted antisemite and black supremacist Louis Farrakhan.
4987 � Congresswoman Ilhan Omar is not an Arab. She has been condemned by major political and religious figures for promoting anti-Semitism. If not for the protection of the congressional black caucus, she would have been condemned by congressional resolution for her antisemitic statements and beliefs.
