This document contains so many errors and so much objectional material that it is impossible to enumerate them all. I particularly object to the study
(Handout B) in which students are directed to step forward or backward depending on their various personal characteristics and experiences. This
exercise is an invasion of the students' privacy and subjects them to embarrassment and humiliation. ALL the students are subjected to this mistreatment. They are publicly designated as "victims" or "oppressors" (both categories are negative stereotypies) through no fault of their own. This robs them of their individual dignity in front of their teachers and their peers. Certain personal characteristics are obvious (skin color, hair), but others are private, and nobody's business outside the individual student's
family.
