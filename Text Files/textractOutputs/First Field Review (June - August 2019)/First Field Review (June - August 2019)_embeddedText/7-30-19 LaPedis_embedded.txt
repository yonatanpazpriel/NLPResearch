Lines 30-33 � Why is this model coming from a position of negativity and victimhood? "impact of race and racism" and "interlocking systems of oppression and privilege." Why don't you lead with why the USA is a melting pot with a system of government that calls to people from all over the world to come here to live in peace and equality? Lines 43-48. Again with the negativity and making students feel like victims. What is it with you people? "teachers can organize their instruction around various themes..." and then you list a bunch of BS left-wing "make people feel bad" items. Lines 61-77. Again victimization. Why not teach the positive? Melting Pot, Everyone learns English, Anyone can get ahead with hard work... Line 87. "systems of power are: white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy." I agree that White Supremacy is bad, but I believe multiple studies show that the LACK of a patriarchy in Black communities is what leads to poverty, gangs and black on black crime. And for gosh sakes, Capitalism is the great equalizer which lets anyone get ahead with hard work. Line 95. Need a definition of "femmes of color" please. You mean "colored women?"

I am not honestly sure what the authors are intending to do with this curriculum, but it really seems sexist, racist and misogynist to the core. Whomever worked on it sounds like they have a deep-seated hate of everything that is good in the world. I cannot imagine that this belongs anywhere else than in the dustbin of history as a very bad idea. Perhaps send it to Putin � it could be used in Russia, Cuba and Venezuela. They like socialist stuff in those countries.
