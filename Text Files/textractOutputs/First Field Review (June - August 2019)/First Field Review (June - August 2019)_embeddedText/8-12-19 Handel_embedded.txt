[Include the page and line number(s) here� As a first generation American Jew and proud graduate of the Los Angeles Unified School System (where I went to a very diverse campus), I am shocked by the exclusion of Antisemitism from your ethnic studies Model Curriculum as well as the inclusion of the promotion of the BDS movement and singling out of Israel for special critique. I refer to the very well written letter from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus as a more succinct and thorough summary of my feelings. In sum, however, I question what the goal is of this curriculum � to me the goal should be a coming together of all groups in greater understanding. I feel that your goal is the creation of animosity and division.
