Unfortunately, those of us who pay attention to the Sacramento Leftist shenanigans trust a model curriculum as far as we can throw it. Although we personally are too busy trying to serve our small, low income community with a top quality store to be able to read the dozens of pages, some we trust have read them. We understand that the model is skewed with the knee-jerk bias against capitalism and the opportunities it affords so many to prosper and lead comfortable, meaningful lives.
We also understand that it is skewed against Israel against a background of anti Semitism. Again, no surprise, considering the source.
Yes, we would gladly leave this state, relieving the socialists in Sacto of a few dissident voices protesting their choking this once-fine state but for our obligation to our community. It's a tragedy that you people continue to push California down the slope to perdition.
