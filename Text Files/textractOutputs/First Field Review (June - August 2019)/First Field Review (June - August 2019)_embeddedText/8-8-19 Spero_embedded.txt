From: David Spero RN Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 5:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Fwd: [JVPBA Discuss] Stop Conservative Attack on Ethnic Studies and Arab American Community Curriculum
Dear Esteemed CDE Team,
As a Jewish Californian, I support Ethnic Studies in California public high schools, including curriculum that the Arab American community believes to be important. I do NOT stand with groups like the AMCHA initiative who confuse every criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism and try to suppress ethnic studies. They do not speak for me or for many other Jews. It is critical that students learn about issues of race, class and gender. The benefits of Ethnic Studies have been well documented including better student academic performance, and higher graduation and college enrollment rates.
