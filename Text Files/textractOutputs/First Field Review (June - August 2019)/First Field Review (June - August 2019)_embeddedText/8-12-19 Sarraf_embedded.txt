Hello,
The proposed curriculum for California's young students needs to be halted. The amount of inaccuracies as well as depictions against Jews and Israel is a big problem to be teaching students. It is already an issue where we Jews need to fight against being slandered, harassed and demonized even further. Please, we beg you to put an end to this proposed curriculum which is clearly Anti-Israel and Anti-Semitic!
Lastly, shame on the UC and Cal State systems for allowing students to spew hatred against Jews and Israelis. This happens on nearly every campus and makes being a jew openly even more difficult.
Thank you, Daniel
