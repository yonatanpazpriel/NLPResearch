Dear Curriculum Committee, First of all, I totally support the development of an Ethnic Studies curriculum. I know from my own teaching experiences that the subject itself can be very challenging for instructors and students alike. I also know it is truly essential! However, I note that the curriculum does not include anti-semitism and Jew-hatred. The US has had a long history with this issue, and it is certainly present in the lives of students today. Having 7 grandchildren in the CA school system, I have been made aware of direct experiences they have had with prejudice and anti-semitism. Jews are a very tiny minority, unlike African-Americans, Latinos, and other "diverse" groups. It is easy to skip over them, and over the problems they encounter with hatred, exclusion, prejudice, and violence on a regular basis. I do not know of any other group whose houses of worship require barriers for protection, security guards, and airport-like inspection procedures. Surely, this clearly indicates threat! Please amend your Ethnic Studied curriculum to include this population! Thank you Juliet Rothman
