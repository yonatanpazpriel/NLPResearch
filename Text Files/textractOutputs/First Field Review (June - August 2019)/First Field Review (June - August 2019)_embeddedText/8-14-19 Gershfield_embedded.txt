Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a parent of Jewish children who are a very small minority in our school district, I fear that the proposed ESMC could fuel prejudice. It is concerning that the ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Kristin Gershfield
