The most divisive (and racial) piece of propaganda produced by a public institution that I have ever read. Obviously, your goal is to produce a society wallowing in victimhood. I'm not buying it, and most of your students won't either. George Jackson � a hero of prison reform? Delusional! A simple search of Wikipedia tells a radically different story. My financial support for Charter Schools and vouchers just went through the roof.
