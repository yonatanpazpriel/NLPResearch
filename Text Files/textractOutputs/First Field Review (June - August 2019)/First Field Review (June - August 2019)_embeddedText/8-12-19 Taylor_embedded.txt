Generally, I believe it is good to promote the study and appreciation of ethnic and cultural diversity. All students should be exposed to the contributions, struggles, and histories of the various groups that make California and the United States what it is today. I believe that within the ethnic studies course, appreciation ought to include the following for the following reasons:
A) Appreciation of what I will term (since this is a "democratic" forum) EuroAmerican cultures and ethnicities, which are many, multi-faceted, and loosing "majority" status. Young underprivileged minority groups should be made aware of what Euro-Americans are going through as they face a kind of dehumanization at the hands of the ethnic studies curriculum. I am serious. I do not think this is necessarily intentional, but it will happen. I do not believe the proponents of this curriculum are considering that the slant of this curriculum, in demonizing Euro-dominance and colonialism during the last six centuries, will damage the sense of value of these students. They will now internalize the damage done by their ancestors, they will feel guilty and experience dehumanization, and perhaps become bitter and angry. I hope this is not the goal of this program, but these Euro-

American kids need to be valued as well, especially since they are becoming, and in some areas already are, one among many minorities. B) Re: changing spelling.... Putting "x's" where "i's" used to be [attempting, I would guess, to promote feminist doctrine], places stigma on the male population; which is already troubled by gang-related destructive behavior in poor minority populations, and with "supremacist" tendencies in the Euro-American population. Devaluing and dehumanizing these males is a contributing cause to so much of the recent violence in this country. I would highly recommend, therefore, that you NOT change traditional spellings that would engender bitterness and anger where these young males already feel de-valued. We need to encourage male participation and value, not try to get rid of these young men via spelling tricks. C) Further development of his curriculum should include the voices of people who perhaps feel "devalued" by being left out or demonized in this curriculum. Their perspective is necessary if this is to be a truly "inclusive" venture. You might want to get the perspective of Euro-Americans just to see how teachers could be sensitive to their plight as well. D) The overview states one of the goals is supporting student "activism", which includes protests, and etc. How about also encouraging students working within the system, so they don't feel guilty becoming student leaders or participating on student councils? Or are the authors of this overview only concerned with how to overthrow our current system by mass demonstrations and protests? E) This line only mentions "college readiness". I hate to tell you this, but not all students need college. Perhaps you should also mention vocational readiness. Students should not be de-valued for choosing a trade or other job as their first choice over going to college. Thank God vocational training is making a come-back!!

F) The tone of the Overview in particular is so very negative toward the "dominant" culture and all its undeniable bad elements. Please include positives about that culture. For example, the line, "created equal" in the Declaration of Independence, which gave permission, even before slavery was undone, to seek equality for all. Because of it, this curriculum can even now attempt to foster better understanding and appreciation for everyone.
G) Accompliceship, activism, BDS, are only three terms from the first pages of the Glossary which are highly slanted politically. I would think this curriculum is a primer for leftist political agenda instead of a good look at how to appreciate the contributions of the ethnic groups of our society. Another term is: cisheteropatriarchy. Really? Which ethnic group is this? Why is this even a thing? Is it evil? I bet your answer is "yes". Why would that be? Is all evil created by heterosexual men? Why are we teaching this in school? It is a one-sided uber-progressive view. The tail wags the dog here. Bring some balance, some common sense rather than feminist/Progressive rage into the classroom. I pay my taxes. Let's not insult "the people", who pay your salaries. Thank you.
