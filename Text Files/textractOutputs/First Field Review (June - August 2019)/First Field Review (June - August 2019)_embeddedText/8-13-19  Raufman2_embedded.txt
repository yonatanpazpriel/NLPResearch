Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
On line 5561-5562 on page 259, in a portion of the text discussing Arab Stereotypes, the curriculum states: Palestinians: terrorists, blow up airlines, try to "destroy Israel" and "drive the Jews into the sea." The Palestinian Liberation Organization (the PLO) signed the Oslo Peace Accords in 1993 and agreed to peaceful negotiations with the State of Israel to resolve outstanding differences, however, some radical elements rejected Oslo and continue to carry out terrorist attacks. Furthermore, over the prior 30 years of the PLO's history, it blew up airplanes, tried to destroy Israel, and "drive the Jews into the sea." In fact, far from being a stereotype, these are the stated goals of terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. The main point, should be that all Palestinians should not be defined by the radicals just as all Arabs should not be defined by their terrorist sector just as all Jewish people should not be defined as anti Palestinian.

Thus, the inclusion of false, misleading and inaccurate, and even anti-Semitic material in the proposed model curriculum makes the absence of any positive inclusion of Jews or Jewish Studies even more glaring.

Glossary and Bibliography

The glossary omits the definition of Anti-Semitism which is hatred of Jews. Jews are the most frequently targeted religious group when hate crimes are committed. This is true in California and nationally as well. We are 3% of the population and over 11% of Hate Crimes. People need to be educated about who we are and what we stand for

Arab American Studies Outline P234 Line 4956 Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter Line 4957 Call to Boycott Divest and Sanction Israel This is a political campaign to delegitimize Israel not a pro and con factual discussion. The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), rejects Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The BDS campaign is based on misinformation and distortion. ADL.org has developed an in-depth analysis to expose the illegitimacy of the BDS movement. An educated discussion should be part of this curriculum.

Line 4958 Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico At its core this is a ridiculous comparison. It is also nonsense to compare a peaceful boarder between legitimate nations and the security wall erected by Israel to protect its citizens (Muslims, Christians and Jews and others) from the people who seek the destruction of Israel and the elimination of the Jewish people. You can do better for the students of California.
