From: Debbie Hirschmann Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 11:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum unfair
The ethnic studies curriculum is not just. It is openly anti-Israel and anti-Semitic . This is absolutely unacceptable in the "land of the free and the home of the brave". Why should there be no sympathy for Jewish minorities? Please do not let this go through.
Sincerely, Deborah Hirschmann
