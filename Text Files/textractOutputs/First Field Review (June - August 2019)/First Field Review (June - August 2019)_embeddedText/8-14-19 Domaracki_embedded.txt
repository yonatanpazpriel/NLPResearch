From: Willy Domaracki Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 10:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies 2020 Curriculum
I skimmed through the 2020 Ethnic Studies sample curriculum. I was disappointed with the obvious bias, and was expecting something more objective. If schools and universities don't allow students to express their own diverse opinions, then the CDE shouldn't be able to force their opinions on the student body. Do not teach this curriculum!
