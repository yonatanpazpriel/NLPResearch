From: Kathy Crankshaw Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 6:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond; Subject: Concern about the new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am extremely concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I strongly support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I am a proud Jew, living in California for 60 years. I was educated K-12 in the Los Angeles public school system and my undergraduate degree is from the University of California. My public education has served me well. The current and future students of California deserve a balanced and unbiased education. This is critically important during these recent times when hatred and bias are proliferating in our culture. While I support diversity and inclusion, I do oppose a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
I urge you now to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Kathryn Stopol Crankshaw
