Jargon such as hxrstory, hxrstorically, xdisciplinary, herstory and womxn are unnecessary and will become dated. Use common vocabulary and omit the indoctrination.
This curriculum focuses on communities of color and omits the struggles, contributions and cultures of white and multicultural people. There were black slave owners and white indentured servants. There were free black people that bought and sold other black people. There were black owners that purchased their wives and then later sold them for profit. One must not forget the role of African elites in the long history of Trans-Atlantic slave trade. "It is a very sad aspect of African-American history that slavery sometimes could be a colorblind affair, and that the evil business of owning another human being could manifest itself in both males and females and in black as well as white."(Reference: https://www.theroot.com/did-black-people-own-slaves-1790895436/amp )
There no mention of admirable people of color such as Ben Carson, Clarence Thomas, Thurgood Marshall, Lloyd Hall, Ted Cruz, Steven Chu, Mario Rubio, Dr, Feng Shan Ho, Steven Chu, and Brigitte Gabriel. Certainly they are better role models than those listed in this curriculum such as convicted police killers Mumia Abu-Jamal, Assada Shakur. Jews of various ethnic backgrounds are also omitted. The American Jewish experience has been omitted. This curriculum reinforces negative/ antisemitic stereotypes and singles out Israel for criticism
Ethnicity is an important part of history, including the reverse discrimination that has occurred in giving preference to certain groups based on gender and color. America is a multicultural society.

Affirmative Action, implemented in 1970, is not addressed anywhere in the curriculum. In Affirmative Action standards were lowered in an active effort to improve the employment or educational opportunities of members of minority groups and women. Add link to https://www.prageru.com/video/who-are-the-racists/
In an attempt to teach about marginalized communities Hindus, Armenians, Greeks and Koreans have been excluded. There is no mention of Egyptian Coptic Christians in the section on Arab Americans. There is no mention of Jews, a sizable ethnic minority and the frequent target of racism.
The proposed curriculum should include the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the American Jewish Committee and CAMERA, the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis. Reference http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/266987
There appears to be a strong bias against "whites", Jews and capitalism in this curriculum, with political leanings and biases of the advisory board favoring progressive socialism.
Many people seek to immigrate here for the economic freedom that has lifted many people out of poverty and enabled the standard of living enjoyed in America. Capitalism has given Americans the opportunity to improve and prosper, and made this a successful country. Socialist dreams have not been successful, and have lead to human suffering- look at USSR, North Korea, Cuba and Venezuela as examples.

Page 13: gives an example "advocate for voting rights for undocumented immigrant residents at the school district or city elections", this is indoctrination and identity politics. Education should not be politicized, but rather should prepare students to think critically, gather facts, take action and evaluate the outcome. They need to be prepared for life in a complex competitive world.
Page 18/19 The intent of the statement "Further, it helps those with privilege at different intersections recognize their societal advantages in these areas, and build solidarity with oppressed groups" is unclear. The reverse discrimination that has occurred in giving preference to certain groups based on gender and color should also be addressed.
Page 1 Course Overview: the statement "They will learn about the interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that impact all people of color." Should be revised to "...impact of all people regardless of color".
Page 36: Jews are both a culture and a religion. Jews are Black, Asian, American Indian, multiracial and some are deemed white, yet antisemitism did not allow them to join country clubs, live in certain neighborhoods, be admitted to medical schools, hold certain jobs.
The promotion of BDS in this curriculum is antisemitic.
Add Potential Significant Jewish American to Cover such as Mark Zuckerberg, Janet Yellon, Paula Abdul, Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Ivanka Trump, Ben Shapiro, Sandy Koufax, Alan Greenspan, Levi Straus, Abraham Joshua Herschel

Page 233-234 cites "Potential Significant Arab American Figures to Cover" that are anti-semitic, such as Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. Arab Americans with favorable views on America should be added, such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali, John Sununu, George Mitchell, Dr Joseph Jacobs, J.M. Haggar and Dr Michael Debakey, Brigitte Gabriel and Sarah Idan.
Page 236 uses the term "Israel-Palestine" which is not the name of an official country and implies it is Arab in it's entirety. Israel contains Christians, Druze, Jews and Muslims. The country has been called Israel for the past 70 years.

Page 2 "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) "currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" The curriculum singles out Israel for condemnation and only offers one side of the argument in a complex international political dispute. This one sided approach marginalizes Jewish students and fuels discrimination against Jewish Americans. Any discussion of BDS should include information from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee on "The BDS Campaign against Israel". Include education links https://www.prageru.com/video/whyisnt-there-a-palestinian-state/ and https://www.prageru.com/video/why-dontyou-support-israel/
Where is the definition of anti-semitism?

Page 15 provides this definition:"Whiteness- a social construct that has served as the foundation for racialization in the United States. Whiteness is the antithesis of Blackness, and is commonly associated with those that identify as white. However, Whiteness is much more than a racial identity marker, it separates those that are privileged from those that are not. Whiteness can manifest as a social, economic, political, and cultural behavior and power. For example, the "standard" or cultural "norm" are often always based on whiteness and by extension white culture, norms, and values."
One must be made aware the definition of "whiteness", lighter skinned people was historically used in this country to "deny people of certain ethnicities or appearance-often from south or Eastern Europe who were not considered purely white". In the 1880's Italians, Slavs, Irish and Jews were stigmatized.(Reference www. pbs.org/newshour/nation/white-u-simmigration-policy). Historically, whites have been oppressed too.

Page 15 defines "White supremacy-the belief that white people are inherently superior and represent the dominant race. It is an operationalized form of racism that manifests globally, institutionally, and through systems of power." The second sentence is unclear, how is white supremacy manifested world wide in governments, religious/social/political institutions? What is the source for the second sentence of the definition?This is a bias commentary rather than a definition.
The Oxford Dictionary defines it as "the belief that white people constitute a superior race and should therefore dominate society, typically to the
