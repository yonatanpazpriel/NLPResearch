Definition of BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) is anti-semitic, and completely incompatible with facts. There is no comparison to apartheid that is valid.

General

Lines 4940-4942 is false history. The US has never taken over an Arab country � where is the imperialism in the Middle East? 684 and 4957 � more attention to teaching and promoting the anti-semitic BDS campaign which openly seeks the destruction of Israel 4992 and 5159 � referring to the creation of the state of Israel as a catastrophe is anti-semitic Jews are not considered as a disadvantaged people? Not one mention of the holocaust? Nothing about over 800,000 Jews from Arab lands that were expelled in the 1940's? Nothing about the Arabs war of annihilation against the Jews?

More comments: Lines 5801 to 5804 � extreme bias against Israel, with exaggerations and missing any context of homes that were demolished are generally from terrorists who have killed innocent civilians. If Jewish civilian lives are not valued, that is anti-semitic.

Line 4723 � Instead of referring to "an immigrant Jew", the less offensive description would be "a Jewish immigrant" General � In reading over this curriculum, there seems to be a Marxist orientation to the material, not a balanced look at a very serious and necessary education on diversity. I have to question the diversity of the panel that put this together � which seems to pursue a definite non-inclusive agenda.
