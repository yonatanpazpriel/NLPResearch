Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As written, the proposal is insulting and harmful to a large portion of students state-wise. It seems to denigrate an ethnic group without being academically forthright.
When it comes to guidelines for all schools on ethnic studies, the point-of-view of a political movement, such as BDS, should not be stressed or endorsed. Antisemetic concepts are poisonous to society at large. Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
I request in the strongest terms to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Dr. David Gobuty, Palo Alto, California
