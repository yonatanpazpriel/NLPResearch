From: Dennis Kortheuer Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 2:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Dennis Kortheuer Subject: Please include Arab Americans in the CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello,
As a retired history professor in the state of California I am acutely aware of the importance of including as many minorities as possible in Ethnic Studies curricula. With all that is said about Arabs and Arab Americans these days it is especially important to include good education about Arabs, Arab Americans and their lives. I applaud you for making the move to include them.
Sincerely,
Dennis Kortheuer Ph. D.
