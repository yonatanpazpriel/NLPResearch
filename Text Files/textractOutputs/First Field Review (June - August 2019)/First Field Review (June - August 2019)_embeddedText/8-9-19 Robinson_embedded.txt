From: Yetta Robinson Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: yettarob Subject: Proposed Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
I am pleased to see that teaching Ethnic Studies in the California public schools will be included in a new curriculum. However, our students need to be taught using a balanced approach.
In reviewing the proposed curriculum, I've highlighted a partial list of some items which in my opinion need revision.
1. Jews and Judaism should be included as an ethnic group among others.
2. Anti-semitism should be dealt with and the language used should be free of old anti-semitic tropes.
3. The 1948 Israel War of Independence should be presented in an objective manner stating that the war began after the State of Israel was declared and the Arab States attacked Israel.
4. Inflammatory language with regard to BDS, Boycott, Divest, Sanctions, should be eliminated, including reference to Palestinians living under apartheid conditions.
5. Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries should be included as part of the Jewish community.
Thank you for your consideration of revising this proposed curriculum.
Sincerely,
Yetta Robinson, San Rafael
