From: Jane Cook Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 1:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS bill
Respectfully I object to the implementation of the proposed policy embracing this political philosophy. It does not belong in curriculum. I am a graduate of Mt St Mary's College and USC and lived in California since 1966. As a taxpayer please kindly consider my opinion. Indoctrination is unwelcome and unwanted.
Sincerely Jane Cook Indio Ca
