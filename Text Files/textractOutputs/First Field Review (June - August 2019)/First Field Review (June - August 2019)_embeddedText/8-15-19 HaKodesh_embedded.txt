This is Hannah HaKodesh,
I am writing to request the new California ethnic studies curriculum not be approved for public schools as it contains biased teachings; anti Israel and anti Jewish propaganda which is antisemitic and against the school code of conduct of California which is meant to be inclusive and respectful of all student minority groups; including those of the Jewish faith and those who have family ties to Israel, the United States biggest ally. Jewish students and Israeli students are harassed, threatened and bullied throughout public schools of California daily. This curriculum does not take the issue of antisemitism into account nor does it mention it in the curriculum itself.
The California ethnic studies curriculum does not represent Jewish students nor does it inform and educate students on hate speech and antisemitism often taught through the free Palestine campaigns which this curriculum has in mind to promote which could lead to a rise in bullying, intimidation, harassment, hate speech and threats of violence toward Jewish students as we have already witnessed at various schools and synagogues in the state of California including the mass shooting at the synagogue in Poway, San Diego. Safety should be the number one concern for all students without this in mind the curriculum is a liability for all public schools.
