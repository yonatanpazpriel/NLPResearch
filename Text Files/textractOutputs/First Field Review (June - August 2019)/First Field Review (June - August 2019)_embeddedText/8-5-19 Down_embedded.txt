Hello: Respectfully, how is it possible the "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee" can possibly define Capitalism as a "form of power and oppression," alongside "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy" and "ableism." Have any of the authors worked in the private sector (the one that generates revenue to fund the non-public sector workers' jobs)? The committee appears to believe that Capitalism and capitalists appear as rogues, serving no worthwhile role in society.
Are teachers who have sex with children rogues - yes and worse. Are politicians who line their pockets from illegal donations rogues - yes and worse. Are government workers who provide bad service and advice when they are in advisory role rogues - yes! Capitalism drives the prosperity of the United States and many other countries. You need to illustrate the benefits of Capitalism to society, not revile it.
Regards,
Eric Down
