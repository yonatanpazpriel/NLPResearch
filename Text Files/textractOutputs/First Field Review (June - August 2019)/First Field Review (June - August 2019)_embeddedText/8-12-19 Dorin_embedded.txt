Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-69. Your outline is very biased. It appears to deal with the Arab (Muslim) immigrants to the US. However, from the late 1800s to 1924 approximately, millions of European flooded this country. The Slavs worked in factories and contribution to the growth of our industrial strength, the Irish became the backbone of many cities police, fire and government workers, then there are all other European ethnicities and their contributions. The Jews have to be acknowledged because of the broad influence they had on Jazz, education, and in building businesses. I see a heavy emphasis on the Arab/Muslim movement to the US, but what you present is totally disproportionate to their contribution and their numbers.

Your outline is not balanced and fair and I would hope that you will reconsider your approach to this important topic.
