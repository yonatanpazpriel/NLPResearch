From: Barbara Illowsky Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond; JIAC Subject: lawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As an over 30-year professor in the California community college system, including working at our Chancellor's Office, a parent of three children who were students in California's K-12 and cc systems, and a past president of Hillel of Silicon Valley, and a past advisor to De Anza College's Jewish, Israeli and Friends Club, I am concerned by the proposed flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
I have witnessed numerous anti-Semitic activities on our college campuses, including chants for a "Jew-free" college, and swastikas on our buildings, along with yelling about the Jews making up the Holocaust. Our students are harassed on club days, just for being Jewish. The line between Israeli politics and being a Jew has been blurred, as I've witnessed it both on our campuses and through the hateful rhetoric of Hamas and other groups. We need a balanced curriculum that promotes peace and acceptance of all groups.
Thank you.
Barbara Illowsky, PhD Professor, Emerita, De Anza College, Mathematics & Statistics, OER & Innovation Fellow, The Michelson 20MM Foundation
