I would like to voice my concern about the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum.
If the purpose of the proposed ethnic studies curriculum is to highlight the contributions of minorities in the development of California and the United States, I find it curiously lacking in that it ignores both the contributions of Jews and the antisemitism they have endured. But what I find especially troubling, is the one sided perspective on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and inclusion of derogatory rap lyrics perpetrating antisemitic tropes.
Critical thinking skills are among the most important skills educators can impart on their students. I do not believe they should be set aside in order to push misinformation and, yes, intolerance.
I urge you to hold off on approving this curriculum until it has been modified to provide a more balanced and accurate perspective.
