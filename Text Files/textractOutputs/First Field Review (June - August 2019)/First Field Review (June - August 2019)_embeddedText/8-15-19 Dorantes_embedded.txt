To whom it may concern,
As a US citizen, mother, and grandmother I am very concern about the new ethic studies that would teach AntiSemitic/Anti-israel curriculum in the middle east. I really would appreciate if you would re-evaluate and reconsider teaching this curriculum to our youth.
Thank you, Elizabeth Dorantes
