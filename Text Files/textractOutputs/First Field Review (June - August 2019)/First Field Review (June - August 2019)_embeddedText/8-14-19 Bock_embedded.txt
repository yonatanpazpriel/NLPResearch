From: kenbock@sbcglobal.net Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New curriculum that would highlight the contributions of minorities in the development of California
It appears to me that the current proposal to update California curriculum does more than marginalize the Jewish contributions to the development of the state, it also marginalizes the State of Israel and takes a complex issue and does not give a balanced view. The LA Times notes, that the curriculum discusses activist groups like the Black Panther Party and the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement targeting Israel, but "usually offers one side and one side only." Seriously, you call yourselves educators? Why would you do this? You all should get detention and held back a grade. Start over.
