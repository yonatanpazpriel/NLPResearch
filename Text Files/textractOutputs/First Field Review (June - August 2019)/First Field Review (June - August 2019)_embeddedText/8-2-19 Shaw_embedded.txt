Page 2. The entire paragraph of the Glossary/bibliography regarding BDS. BDS is an organization whose major contributors are known to be associated with US-declared terrorist organizations. BDS's charter call for the elimination of Israel as a sovereign state. It incorrectly states that the Palestinians are under "occupation"--Gaza has been under the control of Hamas (a terrorist organization) for a number of year; the West Bank is under the governance of the Palestinian authority whose schools are know to teach children to "kill Jews" and which has rejected five different peace plans over the past 50 years. BDS is NOT an organization whose mission should be taught to schoolchildren since it advocates the destruction of Israel in its charter. BDS is an organization that promotes hatred and promotes discrimination; it should be eliminated from the curriculum entirely.

the new State of Israel were trying to achieve a peaceful transition for the population. There is also NO mention that the State of Israel was established on the heels of the Holocaust that took the lives of 6 million Jews, plus many other groups and that most of the world refused to allow Jews to immigrate. There needs to be a discussion also of the Russian programs that drove much of early Zionism. Jews are NATIVE to the land of Israel and have been so for thousands of years prior to the modern State of Israel's establishment. Jews are an ethnic group (not only a religion) who have the same rights as any other group to self-determination. The JEWISH story also needs to be told: The many instances of anti-Jewish descrimination, Russian Pogroms; the Holocaust, the anti-Jewish activity of the modern Arab state which drove Jewish immigration to Israel. The Jews also came to the US in poverty and experience major discrimination well into the 20th century. This history needs to be included in the curriculum.
