From: Michael Pearl (micpearl) Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 7:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum not inclusive or warranted
To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to express my surprise and dismay at the intended ethnic curriculum you are proposing in my home state. I read articles about this pending vote and therefore reviewed further the intent and content of this course. As a Jewish American who has experienced antisemitism directly and indirectly in my lifetime, I'm appalled you intend to introduce this onesided view into our classrooms. I'm all for fairness and equality and treating everyone humanely, but your current agenda will create more hate an opposition than nurturing and peace.
How can you possibly focus on islamaphobia and anti-Jewish/ anti-Israeli rhetoric in this great state and not recognize the fact there are less than 30M Jews in the world (and many other persecuted "minority" groups) and we have faced hate everywhere throughout time. Your intent to teach may be altruistic but your content is not.
As a taxpayer in this state paying way more than my fair share and with two kids in high school, I vehemently provide you my opposition to your disregard of other groups and clear intent to cast another dark shadow on Jews globally. I will never allow my kids to take this course and will advise everyone I know regardless of their faith or race or political standing to steer clear of this as well. Blood will be on your hands as you push this rhetoric once again into people's minds for your own personal gains.
Please consider what you are trying to accomplish here before causing more damage than your ultra left wing ways will ever know.
