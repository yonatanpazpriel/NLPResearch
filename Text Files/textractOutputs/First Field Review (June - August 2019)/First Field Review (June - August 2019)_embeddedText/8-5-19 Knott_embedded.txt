I would like to voice my disapproval and great disappoint in this line of studies. In lieu of teaching patriotism and appreciation for living in what may be the greatest country in human history, this line of studies seems to focus on individualism and oppression. While our history certainly is not always one to be absolutely proud of, it certainly is not one to be `rewritten' through hate speech of capitalism and oppression. We should unite as a people and nation and not promote separation and division.
I am thankful that my children are grown and no longer attend California public school. However, I am fearful for my grand children and the future of this great state and country.
I urge that this Ethnic Studies curriculum not be adopted and encourage that traditional curriculums be employed.
