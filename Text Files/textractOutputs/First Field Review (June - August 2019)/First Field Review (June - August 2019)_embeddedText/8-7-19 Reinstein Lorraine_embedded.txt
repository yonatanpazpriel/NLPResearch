Hello, I would like to voice my concern about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. I hope it will not be adopted or required or even suggested as an elective. From my reading it is biased and hate filled against Jewish people in the United States and in Israel. It is onesided. There is not even a mention of how many Jews were forced to go to Israel because most of the Arab countries expelled them and took their businesses and other assets. This curriculum and AB-331 is clearly meant to teach elementary and high school and college students to hate. It is hard to believe this is even being considered in the United States of America. Yours truly Lorraine Reinstein NY NY
