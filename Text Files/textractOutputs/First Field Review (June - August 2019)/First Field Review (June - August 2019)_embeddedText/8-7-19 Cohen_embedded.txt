Page 2 � I respectfully request the removal of the definition for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. The definition claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269 The sample lesson plan is biased against Israel, and does not offer alternative perspective. Teaching young children biased and un-balanced information is very dangerous as it promotes hate, intolerance, and ignorance. I respectfully request the removal of anti-Israel bias from the sample lesson. Specific examples:
� Page 234 - Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives
� Page 234 - Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico

� Page 237 - Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country
� Page 242 - Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives
� Pages 256, 264-269 - Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders
I would urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

Global comment

Miriam Cohen

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. The curriculum further offers one-sided and unbalanced view, which are biased against the Jewish state of Israel, promoting hate and ignorance. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. As a parent I am deeply disappointed and very worried about the inclusion of biased anti-Israel material in the proposed curriculum. Antisemitism and other hate crimes are in the rise. This is the time to teach tolerance and acceptance of ethnic groups and not preach for hate of others. I believe in the vision of United State of America as a powerful nation of diverse cultures with inclusion to all
