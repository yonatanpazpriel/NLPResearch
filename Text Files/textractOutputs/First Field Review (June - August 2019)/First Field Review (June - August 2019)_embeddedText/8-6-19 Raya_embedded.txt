From: Dawn Raya Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 4:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model Curriculum
Hello, I am a mother of two school-aged children and a school psychologist by profession. The word "history" does not have an etymological basis in the masculine possessive of the word "his" and does not need to be changed to the politically correct "hxrstory".
The rest of the proposed curriculum is equally unnecessary and overstepping the bounds of public education. Portraying capitalism as evil sours children's attitudes to the very economic ideals our country are based on. You are indoctrinating socialism to the next generation while enjoying the benefits of capitalism yourself. Is that the message you want to convey? Please do not go forward with presenting this curriculum as an option for schools. It is toxic and unnecessary. Sincerely, Dawn Raya
