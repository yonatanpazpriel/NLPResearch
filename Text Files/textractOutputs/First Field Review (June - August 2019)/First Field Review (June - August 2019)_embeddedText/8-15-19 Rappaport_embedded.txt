I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israeli bias from this model curriculum.

Chapter 2 Sandra Rappaport Parent of high schooler

It strikes me as remarkable that the word "Jew" is mentioned only 4 times in the entire 300 pages of Chapter 2, including the phrases "drive Jews into the sea" and "hate Jews". The word "Arab" is mentioned over 200 times across more than 10% of the pages in the document. The omission of the essential American experience of Jewish immigration into our country is a glaring. Please add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

Page 2 - 3. The glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" without any critical perspective, including that a stated goal of much of them movement is actually to end the existence of the State of Israel.

Pages 234, 237, 241, 242, 256, 264-269. The curriculum encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but does not offer any critique of their perspectives (p. 234). It promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). There is unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country, which is not the case (p. 237). It does not refer to the country of Israel as Israel, despite the fact that there is no nation with the name of "Palestine/Israel". (p. 241) The Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War is framed as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). Teachers are encouraged to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
