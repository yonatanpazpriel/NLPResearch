First comment is to keep the ethnic studies in the English language and not includes faddish social-science lingo like "hxrstory". It is unnecessary and reader will not take the ethnic studies seriously.
Second comment, the guideline narrative in the model seems to attack one race to try to uplift the other races. This method of teaching is not the best way to teach ethnic studies. It is identity politics. Third comment, the guideline cites controversial people for example, W.E.B> DuBois and his contributions to that he made to Planned Parenthood in solving Black poverty. Fourth comment, the guideline attacks capitalism, an economic system that has lifted more people out of poverty than any other. The system can be tamed, but no other economic system comes close in creating wealth. Fifth comment, the guideline is written with too much ideological bias and misrepresentation. The guideline is a step back for ethnic studies and not a step forward.
