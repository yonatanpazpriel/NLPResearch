This model provides for an educational structure that will instill within students who participate in it a racist, hate-inspired, and victim-claiming attitude toward the greatest country in the history of mankind, certain economic systems, certain social constructs, and especially toward people of the color white. For example, the portrayal of capitalism as racist diminishes the term, racist. Ask Oprah Winfrey how capitalism prevented her from becoming one of the wealthiest nonmale, non-white person in the US and the world. If allowed to go forward in its present form students who embrace this curriculum will suffer irreparable harm not only to themselves, but intentionally or not, will spread these hate-filled lessons to others with whom they come in contact. I would be willing to sit on the committee with the goal of coming up with an inspired curriculum that celebrates those who have made positive contributions to the development of this country in a way Angela Davis, et al, have not.
