I have become aware of the ethnic studies that they want to teach in our schools. First, I don't think that they need ethnic studies and I have heard it said that it was bias toward certain ethnic groups such as Jews. If so , that is wrong period. I think that they should be teaching about the Constitution and why there are differences between our country and others. I also don't agree with teaching our children about anything that has to do with the LGBTQ agenda, that is plain as day evil. Secondly, I understand that they, the schools, are teaching that capitalism, and that it is wrong, I beg to differ on that subject. What other country has done so much for the good of the world as the USA? Capitalism vs. Socialism,I'LL pick capitalism any day over socialism. Also I might add that getting back to learning what the Bible has say would not be a bad idea, many things to learn from history vs. evolution. Thanks for reading.
