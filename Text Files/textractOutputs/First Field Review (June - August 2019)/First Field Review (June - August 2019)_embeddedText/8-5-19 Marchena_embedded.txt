Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Under any circumstances and from the sheer point of view of curiosity and expanding knowledge, (the heart of education) I would strongly encourage that Arab American studies be part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. In fact to call something ethnic studies and leave out any ethnicity seems ludicrous. But also given the the dangerous political climate we live in it imperative that there be a strong, truthful, inclusion of Arab American studies, as well as all other particularly marginalize groups. It is one of the largest responsibilities and beauties of education to awaken minds to our common humanity in the face of ignorance, fear and hatred.
