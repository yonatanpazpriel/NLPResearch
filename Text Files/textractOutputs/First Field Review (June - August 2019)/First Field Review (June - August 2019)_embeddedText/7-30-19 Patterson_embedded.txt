My heart goes out to them regarding the conditions they seem to be suffering from. I have never seen such "Claptrap" and Hogwash presented by a government agency. Any parent who discovered that his children were being subjected to this material would only have one choice, which would be to to take his children out of the school as soon as possible. This is a pitiful display of incompetence.
