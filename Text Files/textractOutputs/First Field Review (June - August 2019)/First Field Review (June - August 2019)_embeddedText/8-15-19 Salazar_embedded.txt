An ethnic studies curriculum should be transparent and inclusive of the histories of all marginalized communities. Some of the main reasons people have fought for ethnic studies is to spread knowledge and raise awareness about histories that are not typically taught in the classroom. So to omit the history of any community would be to silence that entire community yet again. This is what people are doing when they advocate for the omission of the history of Palestine from the Ethnic Studies curriculum. This is wrong and unjust. This form of silencing is violent because it promotes the erasure of that history and ultimately screams that this community does not matter. Pushing out the history of Palestine highlights that people are fine and comfortable with the violence and atrocities Palestinians experience in their homeland every day at the hands of the Israeli government. Palestinians are murdered every day. There is clear evidence of this. To deny this is to is to deny a truth. To deny this and exclude Palestinian history is to align with the heinous erasure that Palestine is experiencing through colonization and murder. Keep Palestine history in our ethnic studies curriculum.
