The proposed ethnic studies model curriculum is both misguided, arrogant and reflects a degree of ignorance of economics embarrassing for any teacher or administrator. It is racially prejudiced (the authors are likely so clueless than they don't realize this), celebrates violence against the innocent, denies science, both economic and environmental, and has no valid concept of critical thinking. The authors of this model curriculum should be discharged for their lack of knowledge, they are an embarrassment to the California educational system. Were this curriculum to be accepted it would lead to a material loss of support for our schools and teachers in bond and other measures, driving students to private schools. The students would be the first innocent victims of such a horribly conceived curriculum, followed by all Californians.
