NO, there is already a severe biased in public schools towards liberal views. This is just another example and route to brainwash children into thinking that our country's economic model is bad and wrong and racist. This will cause further division in our country and ultimately lead to accepting socialism as a better way. This is not what our country is. Teach fairly giving a chance for students to deliver FREELY without fear of rejection their own views and encourage critical thinking, rather than herding sheep. This is just appalling and filled with agenda. Do not pass this.
California tax payer turned if this States views.
