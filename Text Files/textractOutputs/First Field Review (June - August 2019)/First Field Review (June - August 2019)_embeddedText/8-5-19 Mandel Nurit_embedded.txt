I respectfully request the removal of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic content from the Glossary and Bibliography document on page 2, lines 30-40.
The glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

No other countries or cultures are singled out beyond the Jewish State. The content is contestable and includes falsehoods. BDS promotes hate and division. My son, a current California student, has first-hand experienced this in his middle school. This content will exacerbate anti-Israel and anti-Jewish sentiment and actions in schools.

In addition, I request that the curriculum include American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. It would also be good to add information on how American Jews helped form civil liberty unions such as the
ACLU and NAACP in the early 1900's. American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

I also request that you remove the following anti-Israel biases from the proposed curriculum. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum: � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). � Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). � Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). � Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
