I refer to Page 2, lines 30-40. This describes the BDS movement in an incredibly one-sided manner that gives no space to the well-founded alternative view that the authors and supporters of the BDS movement is aimed at the isolation and eventual destruction of Israel. Make it a true learning experience � not just propaganda. I refer to Page 234, lines 4956-7. This shows the curriculum will only deal with an Arab terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the BDS movement that is the same idea wrapped in palatable phrases. It does not include any information about Muslim violence against Jews throughout the previous decades or why Zionism developed before and after the Holocaust. There is no mention of UN support for the creation of Israel or its right to exist based on UN resolutions 180 and 242. Unless the curriculum is going to teach both sides and critical thinking, it is just one-sided propaganda.

I refer to Page 242, lines 5157-63. Obvious bias shows in the choice of words "Nakbar", "the Catastrophe", and displacement ... from the new State of Israel. No discussion is indicated for the role of the surrounding Arab nations in starting what became Israel's war of independence or in urging Palestinian Arabs to leave their homes wile the Arab armies would destroy the Jews there. Unless the curriculum is going to teach both sides and critical thinking, it is just one-sided propaganda. Finally, I refer to the whole curriculum. I agree that a curriculum teaching about Arab Americans is worthwhile and overdue, but unless the parts that refer to the conflict with Israel � and Jews generally � are balanced with views and concerns from the other side, the curriculum fails. To say that there is also a curriculum on the Holocaust begs the question. That curriculum should also include the relevant issues between Moslems and Jews. Again, without it there is no obvious effort to teach critical thinking and that's what education should be about. I am a retired university professor.
