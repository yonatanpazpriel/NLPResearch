I've attached my comments. My name is Karen Greenberg, a resident of Torrance, CA. I am active in the community, a Rotarian, a UCLA grad, a Jew. I am really tired of the increasing anti-Semitism in this country and I want to see more things to combat it, not institutionalize it. My comments are attached.

Thank you for reviewing them.

page 2 and 3, including capitalism as a form of oppression. Capitalism has allowed my family to have a decent life in the USA as opposed to real oppression in Europe before WWI and WWII. It is the basis for the greatest country on earth that attracts millions of people from all over the world to have a better life. Do not include capitalism as oppression.

page 233 and 234. Anti-Israel bias in curriculum as evidenced by including BDS, the Arab movement to economically isolate and ultimate destroy Israel. Why would you include this horrible activity? Will you teach that Israel is a friend and ally of the US, that Israel has produced many lifesaving inventions and drugs, that Israel has produced many Nobel prize winners? This also creates antiSemitism as many US Jews support Israel and become vilified on college campuses. This just brings anti-Semitism to the public school system and institutionalizes it. In general this curriculum teaches children to hate kids of European descent, and it teaches kids of European descent to hate themselves. Instead of a unifying curriculum, this is a divisive curriculum. Instead of teaching how people came to this country and overcame problems, it wallows in problems. Nowhere else in the world is there the diversity of the USA and, of course, it is a culture shock for the first generation. The curriculum should teach about how the melting pot of the USA has given everyone a better life. Why else would people come here if they weren't looking for a better life? And if there's a better place on earth, why didn't they go there? There must have been something really awful about the country they lived in to leave everything behind and come here, and something wonderful about this country. This is your chance to teach kids how to get along with each other, not to vilify European descent people. This curriculum is a complete disservice to the students and the people who live here. In summary, it is very scary.
