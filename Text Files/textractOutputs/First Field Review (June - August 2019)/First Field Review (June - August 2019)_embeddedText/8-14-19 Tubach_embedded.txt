Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
As a member of the 2008-09 CDE's History/Social Science Curriculum Framework Committee (our revisions to the narrative were finally adopted in 2016), I am extremely impressed with this draft for Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum! It is thorough, relevant and much-needed by our students in California. The content will engage our students like no other curricula, and the sample lessons in Chapter 2 represent the best interactive pedagogies to promote critical thinking and empathy. Congratulations to the Advisory Committee!

In addition, I want to support the Sample Course on ArabAmericans, in particular for addressing lslamophobia, Palestine, the nakba, and the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. These subjects are vital for understanding and peacefully resolving the conflicts in the Middle East. I wholeheartedly support this draft.
