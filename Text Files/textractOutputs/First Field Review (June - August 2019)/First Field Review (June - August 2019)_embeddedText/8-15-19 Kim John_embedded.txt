Offering ethnic studies is a great idea but it must not be a vehicle for leftist indoctrination. It should not promote a culture of victimhood amongst non-white Americans. And it cannot teach that all white Americans are racist, nor that all male Americans are sexist, nor that all straight Americans are homophobic/transphobic. Ethnic studies courses should celebrate the achievements and cultures of ethnic Americans, not vilify white, male, and straight Americans, nor should these courses promote division, race-based blaming, or voluntary ethnic selfsegregation. Ethnic Studies should not be limited to the experiences of ethnicities in the United States but should also study and celebrate the origins of different ethnicities in different parts of the world. Ethnic Studies must also study how race and ethnicity are handled in other countries and compare that to how it's handled in the US. For example, the curriculum should examine both historical and contemporary types of ethnic, religious, economic, or cultural discrimination in other major European, Asian, and African countries. The curriculum should also study successful and unsuccessful ethnic and religious assimilation models in other countries and compare those to the success or failure of different subgroups to assimilate in the US.

It's good for the curriculum to analyze a history of oppression and power, but this needs to be compared across countries and centuries to see how the United States is becoming better (or worse) relative to its own history and the history of other countries. Multi-country comparisons must be included to illustrate to what extent racism and oppression are or aren't the sole domain of white people. For example, past or current example of discrimination and/or peaceful integration by predominantly white and non-white countries other than the United States must be included to provide a global context and opportunities for comparison. Curriculum must address experience and history of mixed-race Americans as well as those religious, cultural and other minorities outside the big four groups (Black/African, Chicano/a, Native American, Asian American). Ideally the experiences of other immigrant groups and minorities should be addressed, including Pacific Islander, Jewish, Arab, Italian, Irish, German, Catholic, Mormon, gay/lesbian/transgender, Eastern European, North African, Caribbean, etc. The foundation of the curriculum cannot be oppression. That is of course an important part of ethnic studies, but the first goal of ethnic studies should be to understand, study and celebrate the origins, histories and cultures of different ethnic (and other minority) groups in the United States. Oppression should be a second-tier topic, not a foundational theme of the curriculum. Redlining is a good lesson example. Lesson examples should whenever possible be based on actual statistics, scientific studies, and real data. Similarly, studies of statistical differences in health, wealth, education, lifespan, happiness, social mobility, etc. based on race, gender, geographic location, etc., are all potentially good topics to include.

Any analysis of discrimination, patriarchy, misogyny, etc. should be based on factual data and must not start from the negative and degrading assumption that all of the United States is a racist, sexist, homophobic, white-dominated culture. Of course, there are always many instances of racism, sexism, homophobia, and other types of discrimination and inequality in the United States, but that should not and cannot be the foundation for the whole Ethnic Studies concept and curriculum.
