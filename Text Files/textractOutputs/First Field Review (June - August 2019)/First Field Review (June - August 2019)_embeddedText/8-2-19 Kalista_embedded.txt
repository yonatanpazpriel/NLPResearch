It is such a mistake to feed information to children counter to the fact that capitalism has made the US one of the most successful countries in all of history. The least racist way to proceed is capitalism, as success is truly colorblind within our current capitalism system. In contrast with socialism and communism winners and losers are chosen and not effected by skill and effort as in capitalism. This leaves much more room for racism in absence of capitalism.
