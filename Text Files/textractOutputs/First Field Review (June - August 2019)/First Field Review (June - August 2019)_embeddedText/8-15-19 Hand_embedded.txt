I just heard about the bigoted, racist content in your new course that indoctrinates young children into the anti-Semitic BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions on Israel) movement.
I am not Jewish; but it is reprehensible to groom children with trash like that. There is a ton of REAL history that has gone on for 4000 Plus years and more that they should learn, so we build on the best and don't repeat the worst.
Get back to REAL reading of LITERATURE, writing proper English, and building muscle memory with math -- all so children can be at an ADVANTAGE in life, not the 47th in the nation, or wherever California currently is....yet with the highest tuition and state taxes in the entire nation!
Have you no shame, nor love for the potential of the children you are PAID, pensioned, vacationed and given other perks while entrusted to your CARE?
It is tragic that CA state assembly even wasted time and dollars sneaking in a law demanding another fake "studies" program that helps no one but those paid to create or publish it.
Sincerely, Sunny Hand, grandma.
Union city, CA 94587
Thank you!
