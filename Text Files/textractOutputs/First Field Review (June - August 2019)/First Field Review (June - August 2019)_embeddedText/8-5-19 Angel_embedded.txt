Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I'm writing to respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. This unfairly targets a minority religious group in the United States, as well as the entire country of Israel, which is an ally of the United States. Other countries with potential civil rights violations are not treated in this same discriminatory manner. It is harmful to American Jews who would feel unwelcome in California schools. Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

26 Assimilation- the process whereby a historically marginalized person or group 27 voluntarily or involuntarily adopts the social, psychological, cultural, and political 28 characteristics of a dominant group.
29 B
30 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently 31 aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by 32 tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led 33 movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government 34 until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for 35 the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies 36 associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, 37 universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel 38 and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international 39 governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and 40 military agreements, among other measures.
41 C
42 Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on 43 a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. 44 Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as 45 research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately 46 exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated 47 from human labor and everything is commodified.
48 Character- A combination of qualities (i.e. mental, moral, ethical, etc.) that render a 49 person distinctly unique.
50 Chicana/o/x- A contested social and political identity chosen by people living in the 51 United States with Mexican and indigenous ancestry. The term with the `x' is 52 pronounced with an `-ex' sound at the end of the word.

 Teacher distributes the "History of Arab Immigration to the United States" handout to students the day before the lesson. Depending on time, teacher can either have students read the handout for homework or as a warm up. Students are assigned to mark three points that surprised them and write out three questions they have after reading the handout.

 Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as "Arab," (e.g. predominantly Arabicspeaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)

The influx of immigrants from outside Western Europe in the late nineteenth century provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year.

The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was smaller (less than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. Immigrants both Christian and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.

5164 5165 5166 5167 5168

Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and considered their Arab identity politically central. The term "Arab" is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.

5169 5170 5171 5172 5173

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. Iraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

 Students read the article, Busta Apologizes for Releasing Arab Money where Busta apologizes for being racist. Afterwards, students reflect on whether or not artists should be held solely responsible for reinforcing stereotypes. If not, who and/or what should be? (10-15 min)
 Day 2: Teacher distributes song lyrics to the song, "Somos Sur" by Ana Tijoux and Shadia Mansour. Teacher introduces the song by explaining that:
"Somos Sur" is a song off Ana Tijoux's latest album "Vengo". She collaborated on this song with Shadia Mansour, who is an Arab hip-hop artist from Palestine. Ana is from Chile, where her parents were exiled under the dictatorship of Pinochet a few years before she was born in France.
 Students listen to the song and are instructed to do the following:
 While the video plays, try and follow along with the lyrics
 Underline 3 lines that stand out to you-either in English, Spanish, or Arabic
 Ana Tijoux is quoted as saying, "I feel that music is an amazing weapon, an amazing tool, like to have this reflection with the world. It's a conversation, a dialogue with the world."
 Using this song and your own personal experience with music, explain how music can be used as a weapon and how it can be used to give people agency?
 Students share their responses to the lyrics. Teacher specifically focuses on their responses to the quote by Ana Tijoux.
 Teacher distributes the assignment titled, Soundtrack of Hegemony. Students will explore their own experiences with hegemony. They will use the information they have used in the unit to create a cover for a CD that includes songs about
