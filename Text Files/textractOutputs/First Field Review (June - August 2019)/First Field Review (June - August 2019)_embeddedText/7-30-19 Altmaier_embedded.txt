Paulette Varghese Altmaier. This entire curriculum is the opposite of what education should be -

I am an immigrant of color and a Silicon Valley hightech executive. None of which should matter were this curriculum focused on the content of our characters, rather than the color of our skins. However this disgraceful racist curriculum demands that people of color with any sense speak out against it.

1.It is blatantly racist.
2. It is grounded in false ideologies that have directly caused the deaths of a hundred million people in the 20th century and been responsible for untold oppression and suffering.
3. It is a highly destructive, unethical, and irresponsible exercise in indoctrination, racial-grievance mongering, and, to the extent students absorb its indoctrinations, will materially alter their lives for the worse.
Let me provide just a few examples of its innumerable falsehoods �

- It assumes that oppression is the primary axis for the experience of people of color in America. That is patently nonsense, or we would not see millions of people of color seeking to come to the US (myself

included). Are they coming here to experience the horror of life in the US for people of color? The basic premise of this course is provably false. - The achievement gap is real, (no quotes needed), and shows up for black students and Hispanic students when *adjusted for* socioeconomic status, but does NOT show up for Asians, and in fact Asians of lower socio-economic status do better than wealthier black and Hispanic students. This is proof that culture matters, in particular a value for education and a willingness of parents and families to sacrifice to help their children get a better education. It DISPROVES the indoctrination embedded in this course that these gaps are a result of oppression. - There is also plenty of data showing that until the 1960s, black culture placed a very HIGH value on education, despite the existence of true discrimination then. The fact that the gap has increased for some ethnic communities as institutional discrimination has greatly decreased again categorically refutes the indoctrination of this curriculum.
- The curriculum is unabashedly racist. It presents people of color as lacking in ability, lacking in agency, and as people who have to "demand the system reconsider what constitutions the parameters of success" in order to succeed. This is demonstrably false, as the huge and growing black and Hispanic middle class demonstrates, and as the enormous success of Asians also demonstrates.
- The assertion that capitalism is nothing but a form of oppression is demonstrably false. The facts against this assertion are so numerous that this statement is laughable in its lack of factual rigor. There is NO society that is doing well in the entire world whose economic system is based on anything other than capitalism (including China), and innumerable

examples of societies brought to their knees economically by socialism. Socialism was directly responsible for the deaths of 100m people in the 20th century, including Russia and China. The much-vaunted "democratic socialist" countries of Denmark and Sweden have forthrightly stated that their economic system is capitalist. On the other hand, Venezuela and North Korea are socialist � would the authors care to move there? Capitalist principles have HALVED extreme poverty in the world in just the last 20 years. What evidence, do the authors have to support their preposterous ideology?
I could go on pretty much forever. This curriculum is a disgrace to our state. I can confidently predict that the students who never go near this pernicious nonsense will do better in life than those who do. More power to them � they won't wallow in this racist pandering, but will instead go out and make something of themselves and their lives. I hope that all students - black, white, Asian and Hispanic - will have the good sense to steer clear.
