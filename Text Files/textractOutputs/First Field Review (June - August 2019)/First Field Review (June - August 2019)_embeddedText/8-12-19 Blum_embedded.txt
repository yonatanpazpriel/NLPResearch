Page 233. I believe this proposed curriculum is biased against Jews and against Israel. It is well documented that anti-semitic hate crimes are on the rise, both domestically and abroad. Curriculum should create awareness & understanding, not foster anti-semitic tropes, BDS, or any other curriculum on ethnic studies that not only excludes the Jewish culture but seems to cast dispersions against it.
