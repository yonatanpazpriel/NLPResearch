Hello,
The Ethnic Studies Curriculum is beyond politicized. It's militarized propaganda. Asking children to spend 4 days studying sports mascots which are deemed offensive is an absolute overreach of a terribly biased ideology. Statements of opinion taught as fact do not belong within public school systems. It's absolutely mind-boggling that you think it's acceptable to teach young children that they are powerless over their lives, and will be for the rest of their lives. It's a clear attempt to force an ideology on children that teaches all human interaction is solely based in a power dynamic, and you are no longer an individual, but rather the representative of your group identity.
You want to complain about alternative forms of schooling taking money from the public schools? Wait until this absolute mess hits the fan and everyone sprint out of the doors to the charters and privates.
Good luck with all this,
Curtis
