From: Chuck Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Input into 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
Dear California Department of Education,
Below is my input into 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I strongly urge you to create curriculum to combat, rather than promote anti-Semitism as your model curriculum does at this point.
Sincerely, Chuck A. Biller
