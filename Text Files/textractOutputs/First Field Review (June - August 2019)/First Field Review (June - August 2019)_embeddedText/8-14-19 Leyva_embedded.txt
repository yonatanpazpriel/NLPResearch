From: S R-G Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:53 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Teaching Capitalism as Racist
As a California tax payer, I vehemently oppose the teaching of racism to our children. Indoctrinating our children and young adults is not your business! Teach our future how to read, write and understand mathematics, teach them to give back to their communities, teach them to to be responsible for their actions and to be proud and honorable Americans. As an legal immigrant, now a proud United States Citizen, I truly believe in these values and insist you do as well.
