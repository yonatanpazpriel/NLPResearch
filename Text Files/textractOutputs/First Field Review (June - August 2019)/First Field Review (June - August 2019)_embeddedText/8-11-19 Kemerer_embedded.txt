From: Barbara Kemerer Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 2:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education.
I am concerned and upset by the proposed, flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I support diversity and inclusion, but oppose a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-semitic stereotypes in our public schools."
I URGE you to make major revisions or make a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you.
Barbara Kemerer
