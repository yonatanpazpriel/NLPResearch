Dear Superintendent Tony Thurmon and CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum Committe members,
I am extremely troubled and concerned by the curriculum that you have proposed and are considering for teaching CA students ethnic studies.
How is it possible that you make no mention of the recent and staggering rise in hate crimes targeted against California Jews in recent years including the deadly attack on a Poway synagogue this spring?
Our state's attorney general reported that indeed, hate crimes against Jews in CA has increased more than for any other group.
Not only would one never know that from the current proposed model curriculum, but the model you propose fans anti-Semitic biases.
Your proposed curriculum actually teaches anti-semetic tropes ( i.e., suggestions to listen to Brisitsh Palestinian recording artist Shadia Mansour and the lyrics re: Jews' manipulation and control of the media. It does nothing to address the rabid rise in antisemitism in CA,
Addressing the problems with the curriculum model will not just be an "easy fix" with a word change here or there.
Whenever there is a mention of Jews, the tone is denigrating, indeed, perpetuates antisemitism and express bias against Jews, the state of Israel and Israelis.
Yours truly, Susan Baskin
