To Whom It May Concern:
While I and my family are not Jewish, my concerns about the proposed Ethic Studies Model Curriculum are the same as those outlined in the letter from the ADL. I strongly believe the Jewish experience should be included in any mandated or suggested ethnic studies curriculum in the State of California.
Sincerely,
Robert Norton
