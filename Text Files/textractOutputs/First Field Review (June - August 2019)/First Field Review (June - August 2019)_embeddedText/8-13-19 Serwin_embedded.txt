I am surprised to see that Jews as a people -- religiously, culturally, and genealogically -- are not included in the core groups specified by the proposed ethnic curriculum. The Jewish people have a history of being marginalized and targeted in the United States. They have a unique history of immigration, integration, and prejudice and their status as leaders in social justice is undeniable and to be celebrated. Jewish students are daily subjected to ethnic and other slurs, they are physically threatened, they are subject to quotas, and they are presented with academic course material that minimalizes their history. Jews are told that because they are white, they are not ethnic and they are not marginalized. And what about all of the other ethnic groups that have come to this country and experienced intense prejudices? Are there really only four? Must they have skin of a certain color?

The proposed curriculum is framed strictly in terms of power, oppression and social justice. The proposed story of ethnicity is the story of total domination and destruction by whites. Yet one of the key rationales for this curriculum is to aid in self-understanding, which for whites must be a sense of guilt and demasculization, and for the four groups identified as ethnic, must be victimization and empowerment. There are no bridges built with this approach � only greater divisions.

Where IS the common language of good? Of positive contributions to society and of mutually enriching experiences. Where is the story of co-existence and co-mingling and unity through universal shared values?

I'm not interested in my student being pummeled with more white bashing. Neither am I interested in the advancement of four ethnic groups by beating down the backs of other groups. I AM interested, however, in a balanced, unbiased presentation of facts and thoughtful analysis that treats all groups with respect and truly promotes the creation of bridges, self-awareness and groupawareness. I'd like to know who on the committee that developed the curriculum brings knowledge of the Jewish people to the table. Who has the appropriate training and experience to educate students on this group? If there is not someone with this background, then the curriculum is not adequately developed.
