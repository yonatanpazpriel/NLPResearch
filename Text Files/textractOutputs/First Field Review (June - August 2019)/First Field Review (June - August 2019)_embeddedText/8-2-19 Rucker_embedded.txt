From: Suzanne Rucker Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 3:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS and Jewish Hate
I have been made aware of the proposed new ethnic studies program. I am a CA paying taxpayer and a graduate of the CA college system. I am also a child of Holocaust survivors, parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and am very disturbed that the Jewish religion is being made out to be villains in the CA school system. I am disturbed and believe it to be unconscionable that BDS is being promoted to be a viable form of study, when BDS actually promotes HATE, I cite page 2, of this document as well as pages 234,237,242,,256,&264-269. It is imperative to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the Soviet Union. With all the hate in the world, CA needs to be a beacon of light rather than hate. Respectfully Suzanne Rucker
