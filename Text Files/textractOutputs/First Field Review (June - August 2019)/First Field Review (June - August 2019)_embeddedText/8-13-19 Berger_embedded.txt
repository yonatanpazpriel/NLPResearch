From: Jody Berger Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerns over the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to bring attention to what I believe is a badly flawed, new California curriculum for high school students. It has been brought to my attention that California's new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) misses the mark in its attempt to build a shared understanding of ethnic groups' perspectives and engage minority students in school. As an educator of college students on the campus of CSULB, I believe the model falls short of its stated goal in the following ways:
 The model is replete with anti-Semitic tropes, one-sided bias highlighting the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement against Israel, and demonization of Israel.
 Crucially, there is no mention of anti-Semitism.  In addition, many sections in the ESMC are inaccurate, misleading and unbalanced.  Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned.  Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-
based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews.  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no
balancing perspective.  A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included.
Additionally, the California Legislative Jewish Caucus wrote, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
I have attached the Public Input Template--2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft. I hope it will help identify the most notable areas of concern.
Thank you in advance for your careful evaluation of this important and far reaching issue.
Best wishes, Jody Berger
