From: Steve Fleischmann Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
To whom this may concern,
I do not know who created this curriculum, and who oversees them, but it is clear from what they have chosen to include and specifically what that have chosen NOT to include, that they have an agenda, and not a desire to educate. While the world is busy showing BDS true colors, your person decided to implant them (page 234) as part of the Ethnic Curriculum? At the very least, there should be a feigned effort to make believe that they want to present both sides. But, even that did not happen.
If you allow this to go through, you are no different than the author. In days that our people weep from the devastation created by unfounded hatred, you will be a participant in spreading more hate. Please do what you know is right and remove any mention of BDS and present the struggle from both sides.
Trusting you to make the right choice,
Sincerely,
Steve Fleischmann
