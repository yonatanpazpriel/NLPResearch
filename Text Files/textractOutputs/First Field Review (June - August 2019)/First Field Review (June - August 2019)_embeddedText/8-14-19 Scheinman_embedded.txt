RE: Ethnic Studies curriculum - including BDS
Is the purpose of this curriculum to promote the Arab & Palestinian Political Agenda or promote tolerance for all Americans, with an emphasis on Asian and middle eastern ethnic students?
What can we expect next, classes for the Irish that promote the IRA? Or classes for the Sudanese that promote the Sudanese Liberation army?
It's obvious, that by including this topic, you will encourage so much antisemitic discussion in California classrooms that your next curriculum (after the myriad of lawsuits) would be to show tolerance to their fellow Jewish Students.
I hardly see this as a solution for the intolerance of Arab-Americans or Asian-American plight.
Promoting hate doesn't work.
Also, it's in very poor taste to write Israel-Palestine in your curriculum. This promotes ignorance. How would you take it, if Europe wrote 'The United States-Indian territories' or United States-United Kingdom? Israel belongs to Israel. Palestine is no longer a place. There is West Bank and Gaza. If the inhabitants of those locations want to name themselves and ultimately call themselves a country I would support their right. But I would not support Israel being forced to give up land such as their capital in Jerusalem or any land (Golan Heights) that was won after a successful defensive military action (big or small) and which clearly helps to protect their sovereignty.
Sincerely,
