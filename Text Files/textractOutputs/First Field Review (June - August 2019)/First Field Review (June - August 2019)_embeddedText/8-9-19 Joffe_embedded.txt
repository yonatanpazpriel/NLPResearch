From: Georgette Gelbard Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 4:27 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC and the upcoming bill AB331
Dear Chairperson Chao,
That this bill is actually being considered is chilling to the core. It is what I have learned took place in the beer halls in Berlin before WWII began. Take away the rights of the Jews to have a voice. Isolate them. Blame them falsely, all with the goal of a hope they will disappear, one way or another. As Jews, we all learned the expression Never Again. Never Again is now, with Jews being attacked more than any other group, you must know that and those responsible for crafting the section on BDS know it for sure, but the lies are being perpetrated and to spread these lies knowingly, is a scandal and frankly, vicious and blood curdling.
Chairperson Chao, please review this again. You and the good people involved, I'm sure there are some, do not want to go down in history having been responsible for what will only be a very bad outcome for the Jewish people if you support this and don't erase it completely and start afresh, doing the right thing by all.
Thank you.
Sincerely, Georgette Joffe
