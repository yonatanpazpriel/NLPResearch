General Comment,

I am a strong supporter of this requirement and see much of great value in the curriculum. I would like to see more focus on the history of civil rights and the parallels and differences in the long and continuing struggle of peoples of color for rights.
UCLA Dept. of Education & Civil Rights Project Children of color in California are attending very separate and obviously unequal schools, usually in separate and unequal communities. They deserve to know the history of why these conditions exist and the struggles, successes and reversals in efforts to change them. They should not be taught only about victories when they obviously live in conditions caused by defeats over time. It would be good to have space to discuss racial and ethnic crises and developments in the news since these are issues that are constantly changing.

I would also like to see more explicit treatment on race relations including relations between each of California's major groups, stereotypes, and on techniques and practices that directly improve relations and created the school conditions for cross racial understanding and collaboration. Black and Indian students in CA, for example, often attend schools with Latino majorities where they are minorities or in some cases, white and Asian majority schools where Black and Latino students are minorities, schools with serious stratification at the classroom level. It would be good to include some instructional strategies that bring students together across those lines to work on common academic questions.
