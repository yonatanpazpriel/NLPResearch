From: Tasha Jenkins Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:25 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Feedback on 2020 Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As an educator, I am deeply concerned about the proposed new Ethnic Studies curriculum which seems to omit the oppression of the indigenous people of Israel, the Jews.
I am disturbed that the most oppressed minority in the history of the World does not seem to have any lessons devoted to it. How can a curriculum whose stated purpose is to "aid in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism" not have any lessons devoted to this minority? Worse yet, it is misrepresented as an oppressor without any context (i.e. glossary of BDS ... claims Israel forces Palestinians to live in apartheid conditions).
In light of the current rise in hate crimes against the Jews in this country, please reconsider how Israel and the oppression and racism against the Jews is portrayed and please include lessons to highlight their victimhood (oppression in the Middle East, fleeing the Holocaust, discrimination in the former USSR,...) in this curriculum.
Best, Victoria Miller

Jews have been the most oppressed people in the history of the World. Very disturbed by the proposed inclusion of BDS which has been shown to be racist with no prospective or critical voices. (p 234).
Falsely equates Israel stopping terrorists from entering their country with US policies with Mexico (P. 234).
Refers to Israel-Palestine as a whole is an Arab country. Jews in Israel are the indigenous people with 3,000 years of heritage and claim to the land. This seems to be negated with this proposed curriculum language (pg 237).

Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
