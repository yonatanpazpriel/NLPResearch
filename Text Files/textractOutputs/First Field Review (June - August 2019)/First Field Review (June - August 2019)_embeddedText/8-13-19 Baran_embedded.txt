My understanding of the purported purpose of the H.S. Ethnic Studies Curriculum would be to encourage students "to be come more engaged school" and to assist in "developing a local high school ethnic studies program that reflects the pupil demographics in their communities."

Studies groups with students should be to help them think and to learn how to objectively look at complex issues and problems; to question sources of what is presented as facts and history. However from what I see, the current proposal is focused on propagandizing, politicizing and risks inculcating students with serious prejudicial attitudes.

The strong biases are even widespread in the Glossary. Take a look at the "A's", which includes

neologisms and with heavily loaded definitions.

Eg: Accompliceship- includes "attacking colonial structures and ideas" (good)

Allyship - "disconnected from the anticolonial struggle" (bad)

Androcentric - ( ethnic? I suppose you could make a case for specific ethnic groups?)

Assimilation - "historically marginalized person or group...adopts..."

In the "B's" there is a large paragraph on "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions"- includes the

"finding " of Israel committing "apartheid". One wonders what rationalization would be given for

including this.

Although the course implies the dealing with problem issues of various ethnic groups such as

Islamphobia there is no mention of "antisemitism'' in the Glossary.This is despite the much

greater number of antisemitic incidents than against any other groups. In fact Jews are not

apparently included as an Ethnic group in the curriculum along with an accurate history of Israel,

the Holocaust and the contributions of the Jews.

Lastly I wonder re the makeup of the CESC Committee as to how balanced it is as to

representation, expertise, focus, objectivity and understanding of the curriculum's purpose.
