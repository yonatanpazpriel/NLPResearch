My overall impression of the curriculum is that it is not sensitive to the reality of Anti-Semitism. Many Jews in this country have been successful, not because Anti-Semitism is not a problem, but in spite of the very real fact of Anti-Semitism. Hate crimes against Jews are on the increase, but have been serious for many years. The Glossary contains the definition of Islamophobia, but no definition of AntiSemitism. The definition of Anti-Semitism is very important. It is critical to distinguishing legitimate criticism of Israel from anti-Jewish tropes. Nowhere in the sample curriculum is there a mention of stereotypes of Jews
The references to Israel in the curriculum reveal a very superficial understanding of the history of the Middle East. Are the authors aware that there was no independent state in the area that is currently Israel and Palestine for more than 2000 years? That the UN created two independent states, Israel and Palestine? That Israel accepted Palestine? That Jordan took over the West Bank and Egypt took over Gaza?
