From: gborden@borden-law.com Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 1:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: ESMC Revisions Needed
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
My husband and I have children who went through the California public school system K ï¿½ 12. We chose to have our children attend public schools instead of private ones in part because public schools would expose our children to the broad ethnic and other cultural diversity of California students. Our children were exposed to, and contributed to, this diversity, which we believe enriched all students..
I support teaching an ethnic studies class to all students. I have great concern, however, regarding the proposed ESMC as currently drafted. My concerns are:
 Jewish immigration to the US and California, which parallels that of other groups prominently included in the curriculum, is not included.
 Anti-Semitism and Jewish stereotypes, which is one of the most prevalent forms of ethnic hate in the US, is not reviewed.
 The sections on BDS of Israel are inappropriate and far beyond the scope of a California ethnic studies program. To be objectively taught they would need to discuss an international and historical context including Palestinian and Arab violence against Jews, Palestinian and Arab Anti-Semitism, the expulsion of Jews from all Arab countries, and the Zionist movement to provide Jews with a safe refuge from Anti-Semitic hate, including that which bred the Holocaust.
I urge you to consider these concerns, appreciate the seriousness of their impact on all students, and to revise the ESMC to address these concerns. Thank you.
Best regards,
Gale Borden
