California Wants to Teach
Your Kids That Capitalism Is
Racist
A new model curriculum for `ethnic studies' is a handbook for classroom propagandizing.
So goes California, so goes the Nation! Education, a word that is misused. It should be in California, indoctrination. The State is going down the drain I am a native of California, 95 years old and my wife is a native of the State of Tennessee....thought out the years, basic education has deterioted....to the present suggested curriculum by Statue. Native of public schools, Thomas Star King, Marshall High School, UCLA along with other life enriching experiences....I am appalled that out Depart of Education has turned out to be what it is today....a disgrace, an outrage. A kid in this state cannot be just a kid anymore....must be indoctrinated...not learn something that can enrich their lives, to learn hate, be deceived and led to not trusting but given anger and protest as day to day way of life. So sad! This will not be responded to. We have no children in the schools today, but we feel it necessary to respond.
