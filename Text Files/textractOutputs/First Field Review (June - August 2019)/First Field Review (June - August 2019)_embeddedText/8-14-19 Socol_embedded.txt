Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Although I think there are a lot of positive elements to the new purposed Ethics class for California High School students, I am deeply concerned that in some parts of the proposed curriculum there exists sections that are openly hostile to Jews in several ways. The curriculum overlooks the American Jewish experience as well as the Jewish contribution to this country. The curriculum also fails to cover anti-Semitism. On the other hand Islamophobia is covered frequently, in its own right. I deeply believe that we need to teach the history of the Arab struggle with hope that this teaching may alleviate islamophobia. Instead of showing the similarities that Islamophobia shares with anti-Semitism the curriculum incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes and an inappropriate attack on Israel. There are two sides to this history and although I think the history of Arabs is very important, teaching it using hate is not helpful to anyone. Please reconsider how this is conveyed.

Page 235 the word Nekba

Please understand that using the word Nakba is an interpretation of the Arabs. This is very one-sided and can easily be used to promote anti-Semitism which I truly do not believe is the intent of this course. Teaching the word Nakba alone ignores the facts of history that both the Arabs and the Jews were offered a piece of Israel and the Arabs rejected this and instead started a war.
