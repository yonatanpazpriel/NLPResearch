From: Susan Batel Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum for California public schools
As a California state certificated educator, and a Jew, I urge you to stop consideration of discriminatory treatment of both the Jews and Israel in any ethnic studies curriculum. Please consider: Will the curriculum be dealing with the issues of: Wealth in the United States by European whites earned on the back of black slave labor, and imported, underpaid Asian/Hispanic (etc.) labor and United States control of land that had been belonged to native populations ? It is indeed anti-Semitic to portray the behavior of Jews as sinful for the same behavior of non Jews that is condoned . . . Susan Batel Oceanside, CA
