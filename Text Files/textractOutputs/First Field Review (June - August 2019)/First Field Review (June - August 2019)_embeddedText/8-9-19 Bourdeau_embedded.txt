From: Patricia Bourdeau Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies "Model" Curriculum comment (negative)
In case the Word document does not come through (I wrote it on a Mac), my only general comment was:
The California Department of Education proves once again that it values diversity in everything BUT THOUGHT. Presenting diverse points of view was once valued in education. This curriculum will have the effect of driving more students out of public schools into home school, private schools and c (harter schools.
