From: DealsCart Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 10:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Re: CA Curriculum public comments
My Jewish family left IraQ under life threatening circumstances. Also, part of my family left IraN voluntarily, but apprehensively. Now our tormentors are about to impose a hateful curriculum. This only makes me and my family stronger. We will fight against your hate and devious plans. This is war.
Thanks, Isaac Levy
