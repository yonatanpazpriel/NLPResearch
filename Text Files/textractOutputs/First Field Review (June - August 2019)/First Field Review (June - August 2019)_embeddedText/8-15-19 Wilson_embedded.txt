After getting a PhD In physics from Stanford, I taught physics, and 1 math class, at San Francisco State U for 6 years. After that, I taught computer architecture for Intel customer training. If your proposed course "Math and Social Justice" is a class using statistics to analyze social justice issues in numerical detail, FINE. But if it brings social justice issues into the teaching of basic math, I think it will be a great disservice to the less math adept students by confusing them and making it even harder for them to master basic math, which is an increasingly important tool in many types of work.
Although I have no professional expertise in juvenile motivational psychology, it seems counter-intuitive to include convicted cop killers in a list of community leaders and activists - presumably these are people that students are encouraged to admire and maybe emulate. Suggesting that killing cops is an admirable way to push for changes one desires, in a democratic society, seems to me to be destructive for both the students and society.
