Glossary, lines 30 � 40. Strongly political and very one-sided. No alternate pro-Israel point of view is stated. Glossary, lines 42 � 47: Capitalism is criticized for what it has done against minorities, rather than strictly as an economic tool Glossary, Page 1 � no listing, or definition, of anti-Semitism

P. 234, line 4956 - -why is the Direct Action Front for Palestine lnked with the Black Lives Matter movement? P.242, lines 5159 � 5161. Too politically one-sided; what the Palestinians call "Nakba" was the Israeli war for Independence. PP. 254 � 269. Unnecessary emphasis on Hip-Hop lyrics and significance. Yes, kids listen to this stuff, but that doesn't make it art or literature. Also, very politically one-sided.
