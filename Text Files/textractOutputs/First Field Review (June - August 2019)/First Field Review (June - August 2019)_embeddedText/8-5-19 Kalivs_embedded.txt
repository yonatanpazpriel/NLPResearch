In private practice, I treat teenagers from every SES and from multiple ethnicities. I'm seeing a dramatic rise in young patients w severe dep and anx (including African American and Latino students) who are terrified to view dissenting opinions because many have been shamed by professors and bullied (sometimes physically) by groups of classmates.

conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation of alternative viewpoints by actively suppressing dissenting viewpoints, and by isolating themselves from outside influences. Groupthink is the heuristic that lead to the loss of NASA's Challenger.
Groupthink requires individuals to avoid raising controversial issues or alternative solutions, and there is loss of individual creativity, uniqueness and independent thinking. (Continued on next page)
The dysfunctional group dynamics of the "ingroup" produces an "illusion of invulnerability" (an inflated certainty that the right decision has been made). Thus the "ingroup" significantly overrates its own abilities in decision-making and significantly underrates the abilities of its opponents (the "outgroup"). Furthermore, groupthink can produce dehumanizing actions against the "outgroup".
Thank you for your consideration and due diligence in the creation and implementation of this Ethnic Studies program.
