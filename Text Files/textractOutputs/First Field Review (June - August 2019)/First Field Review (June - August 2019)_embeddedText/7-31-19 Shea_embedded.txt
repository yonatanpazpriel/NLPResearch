To teach children the opinion that "Capitalism is wrong", is a mistake. Capitalism is responsible for the building of civilization. It's why the majority of citizens in a Capitalist society, arent having to eat out of garbage cans, and why a loaf of bread doesnt cost $50. Economics101 Teach them facts; not your political opinions. Otherwise, what you are doing, is not only factually wrong; its teaching them that unless they rely on others for their wellbeing, they are "bad people". Remove the glasses of bias, and see the world without the fog of hysteria & misinformation, because THAT, is "why" kids leave school less educated than the year before. It's been a 30 year decline. Start doing the right thing; teach facts. It's been long enough. The "Marxist/Socialist/Liberal" way, has been proven a failure. Want different? Be different.
