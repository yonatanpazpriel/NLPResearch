I support all the content of Chapter 2 of the curriculum guide especially the information on Arab Americans and on Islamophobia beginning at line 4920 on page 233 and continuing to the end of page 287. I am thrilled that you included Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and Anna Tijoux's song "Somos Sur" among the many cultural materials.
