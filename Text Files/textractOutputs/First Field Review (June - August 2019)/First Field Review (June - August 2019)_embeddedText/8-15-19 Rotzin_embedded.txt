[Thank you for taking the time to review my comments. I request that the State please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. In America we have the privilege of educating our children with both sides of History allowing them to FREELY choose for themselves their own view. The curriculum is presenting only offering one perspective, and that is the effects of what has happened to Palestine. (1948 War, page 242) This perspective down plays many of the valiant efforts that Israel has taken to fight terrorism through out the world. (page 234) It also excludes heroic information such as, it is the Israeli doctors and military force presently that are saving many of the Palestine people from their own government. Thank you and I ask that you reconsider this part of the curriculum. ]
