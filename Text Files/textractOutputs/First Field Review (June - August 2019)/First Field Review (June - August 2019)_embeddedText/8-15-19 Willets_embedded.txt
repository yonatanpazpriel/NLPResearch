Unfortunately nothing can be simple when dealing with the government! In order to be politically correct and please everyone this gets bogged down with a lot of nonsense.
However I cant believe that Capitalism is being portrayed as "oppression". Our country was founded on the premise of free enterprise, it represents voluntary trade to mutual benefit without government interference. Do we want to teach our children that this is a bad thing??
Instead of inspiring students to learn about their American heritage and the positive affects of this, it seems to encourage hatred and resentment over events that happened centuries ago.
This report should be revised with close attention to whats educational and whats propaganda.
