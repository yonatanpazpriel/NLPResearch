P1, lines 10-16 How can it be that a course on Ethnic Studies not include a chapter addressing American Jews, especially (1) in light of growing antiSemitism today in the US and world-wide, and (2) when the articulated purpose of the Ethnic Studies class is to present "an opportunity for teachers to develop
culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining, help schools better connect with native students and students of color, equip all students with the skills and knowledge to think critically about the world around them and to tell their own stories, empower students to be engaged socially and politically, enable students to develop a deep appreciation for
cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." While Jews are generally not considered "of color" (though, in fact, many are), Jews are certainly a distinct minority. Surprisingly, , the word "Jew" appears only once in the entire Sample Course Materials (page 223 line 4734), and it used as a noun "immigrant Jew" which is much more politically charged than if the word were "Jewish" and used as an adjective, as in "Jewish immigrant". Contrast the very next line where "Austrian" is used as an adjective. (Note: the word "Jewish" does not appear in the document even once).

P 2, line 30. I think to characterize BDS as a global movement is misleading. In fact, even the website bdsmovement.net characterizes it as a "Palestinian-led movement" https://bdsmovement.net/what-is-bds Also any discussion of the occupied territories merits some discussion of why they are occupied (even if it is characterized as Israel's justification for the occupation)--to defend Israelis from decades of terrorist activities P234, Line 4972. It is not clear to me if this line is in fact suggesting that teachers actually "call" for their students to boycott, divest and sanction Israel, or if this suggests BDS as a topic of discussion. I assume it is the latter. To avoid the first interpretation, I suggest deleting the words "Call to".
P237, line 5045. The suggested activity is to have students "identify countries as "Arab" (line 5043). And on line 5045 the "country" of "Israel-Palestine" is listed. Israel Palestine is not a country!

P242, lines 5169-5178. Any thoughtful description of immigration in the middle of the 20th century should include a discussion about the unwillingness of the US government to allow Jews who were being persecuted in Germany to emigrate to the US, as highlighted by the plight of over 900 refugees on the M.S. St. Louis. While the US was not alone in barring entry, a course on US Ethic studies should at least mention this event.

P242, lines 5172-5716. To refer to the Arab-Israel War of 1948 only at "Nakba" and the "1948 Palestine War" is, again, misleading. First, the Arab nations surrounding the "Jewish state" established by the UN Partition Plan started the war. To the extent that Arabs living in the "Jewish state" as established by the UN Partition Plan were "dispossessed", they were dispossessed by the UN Partition Plan. To the extent Arabs living in the "Arab state" as established by the UN Partition Plan were "dispossessed", they were dispossessed as a result of the outcome of the war, where Israel, after being attacked by the Arab states around it, conquered some of the territories originally included in the "Arab state". Had the Arab nations surrounding the "Jewish state" not attacked, those Arabs would not have been dispossessed.
