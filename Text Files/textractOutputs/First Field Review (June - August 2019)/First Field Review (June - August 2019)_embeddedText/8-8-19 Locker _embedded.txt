From: Michele Locker Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 10:07 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Poised to Adopt Pro-BDS School Curriculum
Dear Committee Members:
As you can imagine, I am horrified to learn about the proposal of AB-331.
California is the most progressive, courageous state in the Union and I'm shocked to learn that the education committee deems it OK to teach incitement and biased anti-Israel propaganda paid for with tax dollars.
I'm Jewish and have been the subject of verbal assault. When you teach our children to hate the only Jewish nation state, the ancestral and legal home of the Jewish people, you teach them to hate and demonize Jews.
There is a reason why Jew hatred and crimes against Jewish people is at an all time high. That is because of curriculum like this one, disguised as social justice. You are fooling yourselves if you believe otherwise and playing into the hands of people who want 17 million Jews and our nation state destroyed. They won't do it with weapons, they will do it with words, discrimination laws and demonization of Israel and her people.
I'm not afraid of Trump's rhetoric or white supremacy. I'm afraid of these hate lessons warping the minds of our children.
I sincerely hope you will at least have the decency and courtesy to discuss the curriculum with the Simon Wiesenthal Center prior to publishing. The Wiesenthal Center is non-political and seeks to ensure the welfare of every citizen.
Thank you for your attention.
Michele Locker
