As a Jewish American I was very disappointed to see the draft of the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. The most common religious hate crimes in America are against Jews. There is a growing white supremacist movement many of whom still approve of the Nazis and efforts to rid the world of all Jews. It is sometimes terrifying to raise children in a country where many would be happy to see your children dead because of their religion.
When I read the curriculum my first thought was that the authors are probably antisemitic, and of course they will not defend out rights to practice our religion. I hope that is not true.
