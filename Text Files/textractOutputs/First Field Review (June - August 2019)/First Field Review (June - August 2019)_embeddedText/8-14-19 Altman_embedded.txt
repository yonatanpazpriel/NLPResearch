To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to you with deep concern over the proposed mandatory curriculum.... specifically in the area of Jewish studies. In review of the sample proposed curriculum materials, this course is openly hostile to Jews in several ways. The curriculum overlooks the American Jewish experience and our people's contribution to this country. The curriculum also fails to cover anti-semitism. Additionally, the curriculum also incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereo-types and a inappropriate attack on Israel.
Approval of this curriculum as such would be an unjust disservice to our students. It is my hopes that by voicing these deep concerns, you will please reconsider approving this course material.
Thank you.
