On page 234, the sample course material mentions "Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel" on line 4957. This simple sentence alone appears to encourage the BDS movement, rather than explain the movement in a non-biased way. Perhaps language in this section should include the opinions of not only proponents, but also of detractors of the movement. This section should explain why supporters and detractors believe what they do about this movement, in a politically unbiased way.
On the same page above, but line 4958, there is a topic mentioning "Comparative Border Studies". There are a lot of maps, that while true in their own way, need to be fully explained in context. Supplementary maps showing opposing viewpoints should also be shown and explained.
On page 242, starting with line 5154, I believe it is fine to explain the Palestinian perspective of this conflict, as long as the Israeli perspective is also explained. Failure to teach all perspectives regarding the 1948 war could lead to undue political bias and anti-semetism.
Regarding the poetry section on page 264-269, any poetry that uses anti-semetric tropes need to be fully explained on why one might write such a piece of poetry with full, unbiased context of the author's situation. Regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I would suggest talking about not only the Arab experience in Palestinian controlled territories, but also that of the Arab experience for those who live in Israel proper. This could include active pro-Arab political parties represented in the Knesset, as well as the Sharia courts that are currently active in Israel proper that regulate affairs such as marriage. Arab-Israelis are large minority in Israel. The Israel-Palestinian conflict cannot be properly covered unless all sides of the conflict are explained in an unbiased and full context.
Another thing to mention might be various possible solutions to the conflicts, such as the two-state solution, others, explaining benefits, points-of-view, etc.
