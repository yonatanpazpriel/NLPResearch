I strongly oppose this curriculum as do many of my peers. Aiming to rewrite the English language using words like "Hxrstory" instead of "History"?! or discriminatory terms such as Cisheteropatriarchy?! This type of language promotes sexism and that Caucasian people are white supremacists. This is not education, but indoctrination. Capitalism is not racist and should not be taught as such.
Promoting of protests such as sit in, die in, boycott, sanctioning Israel?!
Much of this curriculum exposes children to divisive bigotry and seems as if there is a strong political agenda at work here. The curriculum is biased, discriminatory and teaches selective racism. Keep your political agenda out of the education system please and instead teach from an unbiased standpoint.
