From: Katharina Probst Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Strongly requesting major revisions or a significant rewrite of ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply disturbed by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I strongly urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As the child of Germans who grew up in World War II, I am intimately familiar with the havoc prejudice and hate cause, from neighbor turning on neighbor to countless senseless deaths. I saw California as a haven from discrimination and prejudice, and this studies curriculum shows me that the opposite is true. I struggle to raise my children in a world without prejudice, but this curriculum clearly shows prejudice against Jews.
This curriculum would would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our
public schools. It cannot get much worse than this.
I again urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Katharina Probst
