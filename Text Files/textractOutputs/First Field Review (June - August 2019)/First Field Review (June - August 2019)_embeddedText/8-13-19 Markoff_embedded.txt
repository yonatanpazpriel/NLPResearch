While we find a high school course in ethnic studies to be a noble venture it can be fraught with bias and misinterpretations if not totally objective. In fact, an attempt to objectify the facts of various minority groups can actually do the exact opposite and can cause irreparable harm while the purpose is noble in intent. We would imagine that every viewpoint from any group is subject to debate and we cannot pretend to represent any group in totality but our opinion is that your draft does serious harm to our interpretations of Jewish History and present Jewish culture in America and Israel. In fact, we read it as anti-semitic in both what it states and omits. It obviously was written without consultation with Jewish leaders from all walks of Jewish persuasion and therefore will cause more prejudice than it alleviates. If you are truly attempting to educate students about all types of views rather than simply pushing an agenda, we hope and recommend you elicit the perspectives of those people who have already contacted you with differing opinions of your current draft. If not, and this goes for all persuasions, you will be sowing the seeds of discontent and furthering the prejudices you are purportedly attempting to alleviate.
