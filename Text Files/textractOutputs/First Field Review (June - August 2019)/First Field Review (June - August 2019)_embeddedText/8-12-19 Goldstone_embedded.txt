To Whom It May Concern:
There are three basic steps required for the creation of an all-inclusive ethnic studies program. The first is to conduct a Google search to build a list groups, or just go the LA Unified list of foreign languages spoken by students in the district. The second is to organize the groups so they run the gamut from the most objectionable group to the most admirable. The final step is to research information that will uphold the creators' most intense prejudices and ensure the transmission of those prejudices to the captive audiences of the classrooms.
When I served in classroom (Los Angeles County Office of Education, Division of Special Education and Division of Juvenile Court and Community Schools; see www.warrenedther.com) from 1973-2007 producing such a document would have been an anathema to the professional standards I was taught to observe.
To produce the program I outlined above would guarantee that the resulting document would have been interminably bogged down in the courts as one group after the other challenged the absence of the most glorious moments of their compatriots and the unmentioned and unforgiveable sins of those they consider their most merciless enemies.
What to include and exclude? That is the question. When one side calls an event the resettlement of an ancient land and the other side calls it outright theft, who makes the decision?
Perhaps such an approach is doomed to conflict.
Perhaps the answer lies in an approach that emphasizes our similarities and doesn't exacerbate our differences. After all, the proposed program is supposed to be about ethnic America, not ethnic Europe, Asia, etc. Perhaps the answer lies in an approach that emphasizes the events after we came to America and downplays the incidents that separated us before we arrived.
E pluribus unum; out of many one.
Then, we can argue over how much coverage each group gets. Don't think this is easy!
