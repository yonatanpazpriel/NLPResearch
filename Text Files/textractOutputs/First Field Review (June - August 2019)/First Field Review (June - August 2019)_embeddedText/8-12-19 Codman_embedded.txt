Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am objecting to the entire curriculum framework. From reading through the materials presented here, I find the curriculum focusing, not on the positives of diverse ethnic communities in our national melting pot, but on victimization and negativity. The contents of this curriculum will only lead to more dissatisfaction and violence in our society, not greater appreciation and understanding. As an employer who would like to employ young people coming out of school, I am finding that students and new graduates are woefully unprepared for the real world while fixating on "safe spaces" and developing a sense of entitlement that is inappropriate. It is getting harder and harder to hire these young people. How about teaching what really matters: the basics of reading, writing, science, math, and ACURATE history, as well as how to be a good citizen and a good person. Blatantly antisemitic and anti-Israel. Israel is the only democracy in the middle east. Much of the information alluded to is false and not at all historically accurate. Filled with inaccurate and biased information.
