Why add another layer of "education" instead of doing something to improve our students basic skill sets... reading, writing, math, real science, and logical thinking.
If you want to add another layer... teach the kids about personal fiscal matters, what they can do to help insure their future financial security, not what they should ask of the government, but what they themselves should do.
