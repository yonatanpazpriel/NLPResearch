p. 2 definition of BDS. This definition is politically motivated, biased and factually incorrect. It describes Israel as an apartheid state. It is not. That is a label being used by some to delegitimize Israel, which is itself a racist goal. It offers no critical perspective about the current, complex controversy. It simply adopts the hateful approach of those who seek to destroy Israel and has no place on our public school system. p. 234: encourages teachers to promote BDS, which is a biased political movement. It offers no voices in opposition to BDS and does not teach the implications of this strategy to make Israel a pariah nation. The analogy to Israel having to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks to US border policies is simplistic and simply wrong. One cannot and should not equate the two. No where is there a discussion of how wrong terrorism is or the unfair toll it has take on Israeli citizen, especially women and children and other non-combatants. p. 237: it is factually incorrect and biased to use language that states that IsraelPalestine as a whole is an Arab country. Israel is the only country that expresses the national identity and heritage of the Jewish people. The choice of language on this page denies both that reality and the right of the Jewish people to their own homeland. This is a racist notion and it singles out the Jewish people as the only people not entitled to their own homeland.

p. 242: Does not accurately describe the war of 1948, which was started by Arab nations who rejected a UN resolution for partition and instead marked the campaign to destroy Israel and to deny the Jewish People a homeland. This campaign has existed until today but nowhere is there any explanation of this. Pp 256, 264-269: these pages encourage teachers to use a poem that harshly criticizes Israel but offer absolutely no counterpoint, such as all wonderful parts of Israel, its democracy, its pro women and pro LGBT policies or the way in which Arab citizens of Israel are given opportunities in Israel that are denied elsewhere, such as a college education, seats in the parliament, seats on the Supreme Court, etc.. There is no criticism of Palestinian leaders, who has repeatedly turned down proposals that would have established a Palestinian state.
