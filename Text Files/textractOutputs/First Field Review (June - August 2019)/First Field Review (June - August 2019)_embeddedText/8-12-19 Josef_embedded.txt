From: Amit Josef Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 9:28 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Reviewing a Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern,
Please do not marginalize the history of the Jewish people and their struggles through wars and attempted ethnic cleansing. I do like the idea of including ethnic studies and it's important for our youth to understand the dangers of excluding people based on religion, race, or sexual orientation. With that said I find it more valuable to ADD TO THE CURRICULUM rather than replace it with one-sided antiJewish rhetoric.
Best Regards,
