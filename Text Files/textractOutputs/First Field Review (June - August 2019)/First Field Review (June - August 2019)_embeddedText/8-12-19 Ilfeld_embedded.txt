I am a parent of 3 children in high school in San Diego as well as a voter and taxpayer", and I am outraged to read about the proposed political indoctrination represented in the proposed "Ethnic Studies Model" curriculum. It is grossly unbalanced, promotes beliefs and opinions that are just that-- opinions; but, presents them as fact. Promoting BDS and villainizing the only democracy within the Middle East is only the beginning of the offensive and outrageous proposed "curriculum". I urge you to remove all references to BDS and Israel--at the VERY LEAST (although I believe most of the curriculum is horribly biased and has no place in our schools: far from teaching children to gather information and make decisions themselves, it provides only one side to many issues and thus indoctrinates our children without improving their decision-making skills in any way.
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you, Brian Ilfeld San Diego, CA
