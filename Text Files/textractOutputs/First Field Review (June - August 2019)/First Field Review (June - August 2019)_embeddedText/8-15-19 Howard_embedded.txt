From: Lee Howard Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 5:29 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Curriculum
As a grandmother of 3 school-age students attending a California Public School, I'm writing you today to express my concern over the proposed introduction of the Ethnic Curriculum. I do not agree with this type of curriculum being taught to our children/grandchildren, and hereby request that you do not proceed with this.
Respectfully yours,
Lee Howard
