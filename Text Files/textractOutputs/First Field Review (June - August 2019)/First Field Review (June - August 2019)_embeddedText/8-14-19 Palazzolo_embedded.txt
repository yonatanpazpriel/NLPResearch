Hxrstories? Are you kidding? This whole thing is a blatant attempt at reverse racism. It appears that the state of CA is trying to make anything done by whites look evil. That makes Californians look like the best current example of ignorant racists. Capitalism is still the best thing we've got unless you think Venezula's progressive history will somehow pull them through. Not to be disrespectful, but what are you people smoking? They are called hallucinogens for a reason, you know!
