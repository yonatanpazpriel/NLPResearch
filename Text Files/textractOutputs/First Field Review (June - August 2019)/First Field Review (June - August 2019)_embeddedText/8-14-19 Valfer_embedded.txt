From: Ernst Valfer Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Tony Thurmond Subject: proposed new ethnic studies curriculum
My wife Lois Brandwynne and I request in the most urgent terms that the proposed ESCM be significantly rewritten in line with the recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Council. I myself am a Holocaust survivor who lost half my family, including my parents in the Holocaust. I therefore know first hand about discrimination and persecution of minorities and strongly support addressing these issues for all minorities. Antisemitism is, most unfortunately, a major and growing curse in our American fabric and today exceeds that of anti-muslim incidents. It is essential that a fair and honest presentation of this issue is included in any ethnic studies program. Sincerely, Ernst S. Valfer, Ph.D. Berkeley, CA
