The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to develop culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining, help schools better connect with native students and students of color, equip all students with the skills and knowledge to think critically about the world around them .... Critical thinking is key. It is currently part of high school curricula learning objectives. Why not take this model curriculum to high school students themselves for critique? I suggest a random sampling of high schools that will ensure representation across ethnic and class lines. Run a pilot program that includes the task of critically evaluating the Model Curriculum that evolves from the one you have presented here. Let the students have a chance to apply what skills they have and hopefully provide input from their perspective so at least something that stems from the potential learners will be considered for incorporation into the curriculum.

At its core, the field of Ethnic Studies is the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity with an emphasis on experiences of people of color in the United States. I understand the emphasis on people of color part but I don't think it should constitute the complete exclusion of other ethnicities and their experiences in the US -- and their history prior to coming here. Why? - Because our current problems are systemic and I firmly believe (as a formally trained sociologist) that our current circumstances cannot be fully understood without taking history into account, owning it as a nation, and digging deeply into our systems to fix these problems. Here is the kind of history I am talking about: For example, Italian-Americans were placed into internment camps during WW II, and CA had many of those camps. While they are not people of color, this is an important historical fact. Additionally, Japanese Americans were similarly interned, and they ARE people of color. Further, there is a long history of immigration discrimination from well before WW 2, and many of those legacies persist today, originally applied to Caucasian groups and now applied to people of color. Suggestion: Have a solutions focus built into the curriculum. One example could be: let the students consider helpful ideas for immigration/refugee status reform as part of critical thinking, thinking that cuts across racial lines. Another prime example to look at is the refugee experience of Jews from Russia and at the turn of the century (owing to the pogroms) and again before, during and after WW 2. This should NOT be overlooked in the Ethnic Studies model Curriculum, especially in light of the resurgence of anti-Semitism in the US today. I wish to express my concern that the numerous mentions of Israel and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict seem far afield from the stated purpose of Ethnic Studies, which, as stated, is to focus on the experience of American students. Ex-Us geopolitical issues hardly seem appropriate as a focus for this program. There are finite resources involved here and the intended US-centricity should remain the top priority in allocation of those resources. Further, casting Israel in an unfavorable light, as this model curriculum does, is a type of bias that ironically, the curriculum is supposed to be teaching students to avoid.
