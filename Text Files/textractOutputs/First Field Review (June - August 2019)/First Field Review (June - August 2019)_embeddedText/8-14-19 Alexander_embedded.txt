To whom it may concern,
Anti-Semitism is a growing concern for my family and friends living in Southern California. The new CA state curriculum is going to increase this problem and make children even more unaware of the challenges Jewish kids face in the world today. We must fix this now! Stop the hate! Stops the crimes against all minority groups , including Jews! Please fix the curriculum !
Thank you.
