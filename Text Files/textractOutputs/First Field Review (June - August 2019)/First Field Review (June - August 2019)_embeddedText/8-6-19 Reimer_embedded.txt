Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2 of Glossary and Bibliography, lines 30-40 Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Page 234 of the Arab American Studies Course Outline, lines 4956 and 4957 I see bias in the proposed curriculum because this encourages teachers to highlight BDS which promotes hate and division. Page 237 of the Arab American Studies Course Outline, line 5030 This implies that Israel-Palestine is an Arab country.
