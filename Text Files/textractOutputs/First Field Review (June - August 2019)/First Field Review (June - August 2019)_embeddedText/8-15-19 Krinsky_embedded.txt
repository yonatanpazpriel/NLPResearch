My name is Tamara Krinsky, and I am the parent of a child who is currently enrolled in LAUSD elementary school. I'm writing to ask you to please re-consider some of the content in your current draft of the Ethnic Studies high school curriculum.
My daughter goes to a Magnet school, and one of the things I really appreciate about the school is that she has learned so much about the different cultures, backgrounds and ethnicities of the students. We love that about our school, and we want her to continue to learn more about diversity in middle and high school. However, your current draft of the proposed Ethnic Studies program seems to have a major anti-Jewish bias and that is unacceptable.
According to everything that I've read, despite it's stated purposed, the proposed curriculum has no lessons about Jews as a sizable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism and discrimination, both in the US and around the world, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Understanding the history of the Jewish people and the frequent ways their very survival was threatened by everything from pogroms carried out by their fellow citizens, entire governments committing genocide, and acts of desecration to holy spots � such as when local boys drove a bulldozer into one of my hometown synagogues in New Jersey and painted swastikas on the building "just because they thought it was fun" - is key to understanding the current state of the Middle East. However, your proposed program speaks out against Israel while not studying the history of the Jews as a marginalized people and the rising tide of anti-Semitism in the U.S. and around the world.
In 2017, anti-Semitic acts rose by 57%, and in 2018, the single largest mass shooting in a synagogue occurred. I can't imagine any curriculum neglecting to address this horrible issue for the Jewish people, not only because of what it's doing to our community, but because of what it says about all communities.
One of the goals of a good high school education is to encourage critical thinking. This is crucial if our children are going to be good citizens in an increasingly complex world filled with lots of fake news, conflicting opinions and loud

voices that often drown out subtler conversation. But critical thinking starts with having all of the different sides of the
story. Your current curriculum proposal is woefully one sided, and therefore does our students a great disservice.
Please re-consider revising your program and teach our children about all of us, not just some.
Thank you.

Example of bias in the proposed curriculum: A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
