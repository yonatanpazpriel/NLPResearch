From: Norman Brooks Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:00 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
As a California tax payer, a parent and grandparent of CA students and an educator I strongly urge you to protect the true history of the Jewish people. Jewish history has made invaluable contributions to science, history, the arts and to all mankind. It is your duty to protect this history and this culture in our educational system.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter. Leslee Brooks
