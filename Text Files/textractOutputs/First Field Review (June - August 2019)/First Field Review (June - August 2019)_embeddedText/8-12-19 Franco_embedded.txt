Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
As a UCLA alumni, LAUSD alumni and university student who has taken 12 ethnic studies courses in the Department of Chicana/o Studies at UCLA, I wholly approve of the document as an ethnic studies model curriculum. This curriculum model is consistent with analytical and critical social analysis present at the university level and within college curriculums. As a high school student, I wish I could have taken an ethnic studies course and this model would provide any student in California a critical lens to analyze social phenomenon applicable to ethnic groups today. This curriculum is comprehensive in nature, it is because of this that the curriculum model should be preserved as is without omission. I believe that an omission of any curricular units present in the current version would be a disservice to the wide array of critical analyses and vantage points that we as students of California are accustomed to.
