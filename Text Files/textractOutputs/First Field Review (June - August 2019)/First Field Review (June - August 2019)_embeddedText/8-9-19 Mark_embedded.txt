This curriculum as a whole is racist. It will inflame divisions and reinforce tensions between students from different backgrounds. Public schools should work toward unifying all members of their communities and not separate students based on race or ethnicity. Dividing students based on their heritage and teaching them differently according to their background is segregation and has no place in a public school.

Please do not use this curriculum in any school. It will have deep, lasting, damaging effects on all students subjected to it.
