To whom it concernsI'm Opposed to the proposed CA curriculum that could promote divisive influence and not inclusiveness . The draft 2020 model must be rejected and instead a model of tolerance for all people, minorities should be adopted. Let's not put any human in harms way, let's keep politics out of public education as well. Thank you, Caryn J Yarnell
