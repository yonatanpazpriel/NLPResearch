I'm immediately turned off by the spelling of "hxrstory" and "hxrstories" throughout, and the implication that demonization of males and the "establishment " will surely be a part of the curriculum. Sadly, American Civics have been gutted from our schools, and we now have a generation of students who have little understanding of how our government works. The arts have also been greatly diminished in our schools, and they provide a wonderful platform for bringing diverse populations together while exploring different ethnic viewpoints and experiences.
