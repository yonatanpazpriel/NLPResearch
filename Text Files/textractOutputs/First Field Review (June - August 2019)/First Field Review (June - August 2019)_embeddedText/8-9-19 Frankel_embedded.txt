From: Harley Frankel Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: I have devoted my life--Head Start, Pell Grants, college access, etc. to Improving Education
This ethnic studies curriculum under consideration is a disgrace to education. It is propaganda written with a vile slant with a purpose that is not consistent with good educational curriculum purposes.
� Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. � This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. � The ESMC omits antisemitism. . The most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement.
Please don't disgrace your reputation and California's educational system by approving it.
Sincerely,
Harley Frankel A CA Resident for 35 years
