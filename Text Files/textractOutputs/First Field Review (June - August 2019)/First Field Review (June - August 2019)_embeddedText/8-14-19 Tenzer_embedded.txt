Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I agree with the Los Angeles Times Editorial staff as well as the California Jewish Caucus. When it comes to BDS and the Palestinian/Israeli issue, there seems to be no room for a full discussion of this nuanced issue. This seems like something that needs to be taught in college by a professor with a full grasp of the issue and not a high school teacher. I am all for teaching tolerance; but let's not create intolerance while doing it.
