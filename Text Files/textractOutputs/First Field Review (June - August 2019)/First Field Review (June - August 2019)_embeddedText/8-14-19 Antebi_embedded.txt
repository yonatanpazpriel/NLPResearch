Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, As a parent of two multi-ethnic high school teen age girls I am very concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Excluding Jews as an ethnic group that has faced discrimination, is inconsistent with history, and could further put our community (including my two daughters) in peril, especially after recent events such as the shooting in Pittsburgh.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism.
I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Alex Antebi Palo Alto, CA
