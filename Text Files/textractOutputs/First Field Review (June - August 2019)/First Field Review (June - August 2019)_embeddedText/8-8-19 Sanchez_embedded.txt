From: Kara Sanchez Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 9:14 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment
I would like to offer public comment that the ethnic studies course proposed and its approach to Israel feels quite uncomfortable to me both as a college lecturer and as a Jewish parent of a California high school student.
I have no issue with fair criticism of Israel but the BDS movement is not conducted in good faith. The California public school system needs to be more thoughtful about its approach to complex and potentially anti semitic topics.
Thank you, Kara Sanchez
