Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] BSD should be understood as the effort to ultimately destroy and do away with the State of Israel as the Jewish state where freedom of religion and gender equality reign . BDS seeks to flood Israel with millions of Palestinian refugees ("right of return"), thereby turning it into another Middle Eastern country where Jews and Christians are second class citizens and live in fear. Thank you for considering these comments.
BDS as a lesson subject.
