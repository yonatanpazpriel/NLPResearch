Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
234, 237, 242, 256, and pages 264-269. These pages fail to reference issues such as anti-semitism, yet focus on all aspects of Arab rights and Islamophobia. A balanced curriculum that reflects actual ethnic issues and discrimination as to Jews and Israel must be part of the Department of Education's teachings.
