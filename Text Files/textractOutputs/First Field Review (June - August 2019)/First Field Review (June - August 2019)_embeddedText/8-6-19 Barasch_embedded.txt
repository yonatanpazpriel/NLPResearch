Page 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269 I am concerned by the content in these pages. Although there is a specific unit on Islamaphobia, there is none on anti-semitism. Why is this not addressed as well. There is a huge issue with describing the BDS movement as "a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." Israel is not an apartheid country. It is the only democracy in the Middle East. Palestinians do not want to be associated with Israel or be Israeli citizens. Our own Federal government is banning BDS since it is not founded on truth. My Jewish ancestors are indigenous to Israel (my father is a Sabra and born in Afula) which means that our return is not the same as colonizing. The situation is complicated, it can't be turned into sound-bite.

Pg 235 �calling this day only as the Nakba and not Israeli Independency Day is terribly insensitive and negating the lives lost and the legitimacy of Israel PG 238 �Why is the Arab and Latino immigration experience being compared and no comparison of the Jewish immigration experiences. PG 258 �why is there no comparable study of Jewish stereotypes.

Why are Jews not considered a minority and not part of the curriculum? I am finding the curriculum blatantly biased against Israel and completely erases the American Jewish experience. Further it does nothing to educate about antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and will institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in public school. Why isn't Saudi Arabia, Quitar, Iran, etc. called out for their human rights violations, along with oppression of women, LGBT, etc? This is unacceptable.
