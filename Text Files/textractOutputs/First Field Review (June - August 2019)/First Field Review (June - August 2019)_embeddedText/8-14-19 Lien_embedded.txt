[Include the page and line number(s) here�Thank you so much for a genuine attempt to create a balanced and inclusive model curriculum, even if as an Asian American, I certainly would like to make sure students learn of key ethnic events such as Chinese exclusion, Japanese internment, Filipino labor movement, and Korean protests in the aftermath of Sa-I-Gu.] Very useful and accessible glossary. Wonder if we can include terms like "affirmative action," "ethnocentrism," "terrorism," and "white nationalism," so that students can have a better grasp of what's going on in current American politics.
