I am writing to you because I am alarmed at the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) . If AB 331 is approved by the California state legislature in the coming days, every high school student in the state will be required to take an ethnic studies course based on the ESMC before graduating. However, as currently set, the ESMC uses classic anti-Semitic stereotypes, and contains blatant anti-Israel bias. This proposed curriculum teaches children stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. Public education in Calfornia should not be allowed to be hijacked by those pushing a political and hateful agenda.

The anti-Jewish, anti-Israel bias of the proposed ESMC curriculum -- including its implicit portrayal of Jews and Israel as part of "interlocking systems of oppression and privilege" and its endorsement of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement as a form of "direct action" or "resistance" that students are encouraged to engage in -- clearly exposes the politically motivated and directed nature of the curriculum and its drafters. The proposed curriculum is being use as a tool for politically indoctrinating California's high school students with anti- Israel propaganda and encouraging them to engage in political activism against the Jewish state. This is certainly not what state legislators had in mind when they mandated the development of "a model curriculum in ethnic studies" for use in California high schools, with the primary objective of "preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures." Indeed, the political indoctrination at the heart of the ESMC does the exact opposite.

Moreover, there is considerable evidence showing that the kind of anti-Zionist propaganda and activism promoted in the ESMC is strongly linked to acts of anti-Jewish hostility, including acts of harassment, vandalism and assault. Implementation of a model curriculum that includes the promulgation of such political, ethnic or religious hatred can't help but threaten the safety and well-being of Jewish and pro-Israel high school students in the state.

The drafters of this curriculum should not be permitted to use the model curriculum to promote political, ethnic or religious enmity towards any group, or to weaponize high school students to take action based on such enmity.
