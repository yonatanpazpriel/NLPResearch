From: Steve Murray Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 12:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Feedback on model curriculum
California Department of Education:
The draft ethnic studies curriculum includes "critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression." Too often ethic studies classes are classes of propaganda not education.
There have been problems with capitalism and these should be discussed along with the problems with socialism and communism and other economic systems. If only the negatives of capitalism are discussed, students will be ignorant that this system has helped more people out of poverty (see Steven Pinker's book Enlightenment Now) than any other economic system in history. That's important to know.
"Ableism" is discrimination in favor of able bodied people. While disabled people should have every opportunity to achieve all that they are physically capable of doing, it's important to recognize that there are many things that only able bodies people can do. It is not a form of prejudice to recognize this.
I am a straight white male and feel it is unfair to hear many people reflexively assume that I am racist, homophobic and part of the patriarchy. I believe that too many schools and colleges indoctrinate students into making this assumption. Instead of dividing people into tribes, each with their list of grievances, I suggest that more time needs to be spent on what unifies us as people.
