What started out as a commendable plan o educate young Californians about the ethnic diversity of their state has degenerated into an ugly and divisive exercise. What motivated the writers of the current draft to single out the only true tolerant democracy in the Middle East for specific criticism and ignore the expression of anti-Semitism in our society? I urge your committee to reject this ideological product and commence a more meaningful and truthful report.
I am emeritus Professor of Political Science, University of California, Davis.
Sincerely,
Alvin D. Sokolow
