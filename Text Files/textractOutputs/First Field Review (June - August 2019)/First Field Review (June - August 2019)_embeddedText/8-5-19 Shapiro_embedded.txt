Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 please remove all mention of BDS from the curriculum. BDS, in the words of its founder, has the goal of the eradication of Israel as a Jewish homeland of self-determination. https://twitter.com/americanzionism/status/1133374479068008448 . Please remove all anti-Israel and pro-BDS incitement. Anti-Israel incitement on US college campuses has already been associated with the rise of raw antiSemitism and physical attacks on Jewish students on those same campuses https://amchainitiative.org/campus-antisemitism-report-8-8-18pr/ . It is reasonable to conclude the same would happen in public schools. Jews as an ethnic group should be included as an oppressed group, having suffered two thousand years of oppression and violence. Thank you. 2 Please see comments on BDS above. BDS should be removed from the glossary.
