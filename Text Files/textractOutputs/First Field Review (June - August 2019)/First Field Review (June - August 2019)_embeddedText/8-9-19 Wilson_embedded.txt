From: Joe Wilson Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:16 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Reject far-left ethnic studies curriculum
thanx to the pasadena star-news editorial for alerting its readers to this, new age, guru inspired pablum, which, if implemented will further dumb down the students. exposed to it. calif. has a miserable track record of educating students, and this proposal is just another example of people(with an agenda, or dupes) being in a position to foist yet another so called educational platform onto an already burdened student population. capitalism is what built and continues to sustain this country. in your header describing the goals of this proposal are racist, revisionist historical, comments and sheer lunacy. one could believe that the people behind this are ones that were"educated under this Calif. educational system, and this is the net result. you people need to be doing what other countries are doing(and cheaper) and their students are better educated and can go head to toe with our failing students and clean their clocks. this is another exercise in futility, doomed to fail and poisoning the minds of our young people with stuff that wont help them in an ever changing world, or compete with their counterparts worldwide. shame on you all, for this monstrosity . thank you, joe and lola wilson.
