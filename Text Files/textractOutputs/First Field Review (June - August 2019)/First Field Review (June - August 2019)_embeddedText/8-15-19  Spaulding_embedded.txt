I am concerned that this program, as outlined, will serve to be a divisive program that will inflame ethnic, cultural and racial differences rather than bring students from these different groups together. It also seems to be driven by a certain left leaning academic approach rather than an objective non-biased approach. This left leaning academic approach is value laden in such a way that students who may have a different point of view will be marginalized and made to feel wrong for not having the same values of the program's authors. I also question whether a program like this will actually benefit students academically which should be the prime focus of their elementary and high school education � to prepare them for college and the work place rather than prepare them to be social justice warriors.
