Dear educators at CRIFD: Please do be educators and not simply mob-mentality-followers of easy hate. Jews have lived in the land of Israel, called Palestine years ago, for thousands of years. Don't believe it? Look at the remnants of the Jewish temple. Need more proof? Look at the birth certificates of Jews who lived there prior to independence from the British mandate. The movie, "The Golddiggers of 1933" produced in Hollywood years before WWII has Jewish people as "Palestinians." Saying Jews do not belong there, regardless of what you call the area is antisemitic, racist, and wrong. As educators, it should be clear that you cannot just go along with haters because it is easier to follow along with their false narrative that Jews don't belong there. The people you may now call Palestinians belong in Jordan just as much as Israel. But singling out Israel as having no right to exist for Jews is just ignorant rantings of those too pleased to jump onboard the latest anti-Jewish train. The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should not be a state-sponsored instrument of hate against Jews. You might not care that a few mis"facts" get taught to the all-too-willing innocents of California but that is just the reason you exist: to prevent such travesties. Please do better. Thank you.
