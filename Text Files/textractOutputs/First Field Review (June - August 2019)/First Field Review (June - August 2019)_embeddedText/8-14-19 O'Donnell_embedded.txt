I don't agree that any curriculum that attacks capitalism has a place in the classroom. Capitalism has made our country the richest country in the history of the world pulling millions out of poverty. No economic system is perfect including capitalism but our market oriented system is by far the most beneficial to workers, prosperity and security.
This proposed curriculum is based on reprehensible ideological bias. Capitalism described as a form of racism, white supremacy and oppression is complete academic crap developed by out of main stream political indoctrination ideologues.
This is pure political propaganda, not education and does not belong in the classroom. It should be trashed and a new developed.
