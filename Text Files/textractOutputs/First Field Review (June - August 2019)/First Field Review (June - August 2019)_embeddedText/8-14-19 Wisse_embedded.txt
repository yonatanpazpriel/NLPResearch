Your mention of the BDS movement whitewashes its intent. BDS is dedicated to the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state and should not be given credence in your curriculum. And in general, ethnic studies does not mean victim studies. Your curriculum should focus on the accomplishments of groups, not on the discrimination that they have encountered.
