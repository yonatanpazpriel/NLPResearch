This proposed curriculum would make the former Soviets proud. It erases history, ignores facts, creates a new language for its propaganda, and has as its primary focus brainwashing rather than educating.

Where socialism, communism and dictatorship have left the world starving, an agricultural entrepreneur working in a capitalist system created a hearty, healthy form of grain that grows almost everywhere and largely wiped out large-scale hunger in the world. The proposed curriculum mentions nothing about this, and demonizes capitalism and exults communism (which is dictatorship by another name) and socialism.

Where communism and dictatorships create elites living off the work of their slaves, capitalism is the only system with healthy middle classes and true opportunity for lowerand middle-class residents to rise up to upper class through hard work and merit. The proposed curriculum mentions nothing about this, and demonizes capitalism and exults communism (which is dictatorship by another name) and socialism.

Where Israel is the only country in the entire Middle East that allows Palestinians to vote for President/Prime Minister (the Palestinian Authority does not hold elections anymore), the proposed curriculum goes out of its way to promote anti-Semitic organizations founded and supported by the terrorist organization Hamas (and indirectly by Hamas's financial backer, the terrorist government of Iran).

Time to put real leaders in charge of developing the curriculum, not a bunch of propogandists desperately longing to justify the years they spent earning degrees based on lies and fake history.

Junk the proposed curriculum. Start over, or (even better!) leave it to the counties and school districts to decide what is appropriate and needed for their students!
