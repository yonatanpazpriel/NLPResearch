From: Jan Flournoy Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:17 AM To: Superintendent Subject: New curriculum
My husband and I ask you not to pursue the new curriculum. It is dishonoring to Jewish people and is anti Semitic. Also we don t need to focus on how everything is unfair. We need to inspire hope and encourage use of opportunities Sincerely Jan a Flournoy
