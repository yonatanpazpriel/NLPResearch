I read the 26 page intro and was horrified. This is not Ethnic Studies; this is Racial Grievance Studies. The clear message that is being taught is that people with white skin are bad. By definition, this is racist. When did we stray from the "judging a person by the content of their character and not the color of their skin"? I would never let my children attend a school who used this curriculum. This will cause more demand for charter schools, private schools and homeschooling. It will also make it difficult for employers in Silicon Valley to hire families from outside California and from countries like China and India where education is a high priority. This curriculum will take California's public schools system, which is now on life-support, and kill it.
