I have an immigrant heart. I am a 1st generation daughter. My father was born in Mexico and his family legally immigrated to the United States. I was taught that America is the best country in the world and that I could be anything I wanted to be. I have a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Masters in Business Administration.
I do not understand how this course is going to help a person get a job or enrich themselves, if anything your are trying to create a radical racist by teaching this curriculum. What is the purpose of teaching racism to young adults and children? Teaching our youth that Capitalism is racist is simply wrong and untrue. The reason America is a great country is because of Capitalism. We can be anything we want to be we just have to work hard, look at the community and see what we can do to earn a living. For instance going to college to be an archeologist is silly. What job are you going to get; however getting a business degree will give you the ability to get a great job as every company has a business component. Trade schools are awesome because they partner with companies to develop curriculum that is going to help a person get a job utilizing the training they have received.
The colleges right now are not educating our young adults to be successful in the real world. The educational institution is failing short. It seems like your are trying to create a bunch of victims, not too mention trying to get everyone to hate each other.
Ethnic Studies is just one more way of trying to keep minorities down by trying to turn them into victims. If that is your agenda then I guess it will be achieved because nothing good will ever come of turning a culture into a bunch of victims. It will keep them oppressed which is probably the State's agenda.
