From: Ronald Friedenthal Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: ESMC Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education
I am upset by the proposed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I urge You to make major revisions or a significant of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand with US, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I am the Grandparent of a Fourth grade student and it is important to me to see a balanced curriculum which includes discussion of the rise of anti-Semitism and its negative impacts.
I support diversity and inclusion, but a oppose a curriculum that erases the American Jewish Experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of Anti Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
SIncerely, Ron Friedenthal Los Altos, CA
