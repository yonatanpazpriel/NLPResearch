No definition or inclusion of "Anti-Semitism" on page 1
P. 2; definition of BDS � interesting that this concept is defined while there is no definition for anti-semitism, as above, or for Zionism. Starting on p 234, lines 4956, 4957, 4958. I think it is laudable to cover Arab American history, particularly since Arabs and others of the Muslim faith have been persecuted in this country after 9/11. However, this should not be taught through the one-sided lens presented here � without any countervailing perspective regarding the history related to Israel/Palestine and arguments against the BDS movement, or that present the conflict in the Middle East in an objective way. The language and topics seem more reminiscent of the bias brought into Texas textbooks, and do not reflect what has been the more measured approach of California. P 242, ESM use politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61); P 268-69 (lines 5802-03) � this rap uses the classic anti-Semitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land. Is this really necessary?
