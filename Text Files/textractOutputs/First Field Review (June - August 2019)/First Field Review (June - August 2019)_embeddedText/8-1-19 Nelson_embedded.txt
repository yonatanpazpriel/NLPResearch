From: Don Nelson Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 6:19 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: My opinion
As a parent of students in the California school system, I give you a no vote on this ethnic studies plan. Leave this to the college level classes and just get these kids up to at level learning rather than adding this crazy course.
