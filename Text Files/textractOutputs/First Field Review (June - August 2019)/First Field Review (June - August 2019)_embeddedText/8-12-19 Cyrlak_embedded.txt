P2:BDS does not belong in the curriculum and its description is one sided. Israel is one of the most diverse countries in the world and it is not an apartheid state. BDS actions promote delegitimization of the state of Israel and dehumanization of its Jewish citizens through attempts to stop cultural or academic collaborations. On college campuses throughout the United States, proponents of BDS marginalize and harass Jewish students that support Israel. The inclusion and highlighting of BDS in this draft goes against the stated goals of the curriculum to promote "intercultural communication," "humanism," and "collaboration across lines of difference."as described on p1 of the Introduction. The specific concerns of Jewish Americans are not addressed. The American Jewish experience is completely ignored, including the experience of over a million Jews in California alone. The murder of millions of Jews less than one hundred years ago in the Holocaust ; the subjugation of Jews in the Soviet Union and Arab countries ; and the migration of Jews to the US are not addressed. The rapid rise of anti-Semitism in the US with shootings in synagogues (requiring most American synagogues to have guards and gates) and hatred of Jews fomented on college campuses with silencing and harassment of Jewish students must be recognized in a course on ethnic studies. There is no country called Israel-Palestine and Israel is not an Arab country .
The stated goal of building "..critical analytical and intercultural communication skills" and "..fostering of humanism and collaboration across lines of difference,,,"is not accomplished when only one narrative is acceptable and when the history and world view of "the other" is ignored. The Jewish narrative, including the Jewish homeland, should be a major module in any ethnic studies course.

The curriculum justly points out that anti-Muslim attitudes are unacceptable. Given the rising anti-semitism in this country, a similar statement is called for about Jews: It is clear that anti-semitism is unfounded and based on the ignorance and dehumanization of Jews.
