To whom it may concern,
We are writing in opposition to the recently proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum. While we are strong supporters of diversity and inclusion in public education, we object to a curriculum which despite good intent, omits American Jewish heritage and reinforces anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli stereotypes. Of particular concern is the clear reinforcement of and bias toward groups like BDS, which has a clear anti-Israel agenda, in the absence of any critical analysis of these groups.
We are deeply disappointed at the indifference and discrimination toward the Jewish community inherent in this curriculum and would like to voice our strong opposition to the inclusion of such principles in any educational curriculum.
