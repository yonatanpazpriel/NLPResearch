From: Cary Fulbright Sent: Saturday, August 3, 2019 11:52 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Against Ethnic Studies
I understand you've proposed an "Ethnic Studies" syllabus to be taught in our public schools.
I am against the entire idea of such courses. You should be teaching American History, not slicing and dicing America into various imagined and meaningless distinctions (you might think of them as "constructs"). Who cares what color a person's skin is, or what chromosomes and body parts they were born with, or with whom and how they choose to have sex? Conversely, why not teach how great our country is? It is the greatest country in the history of the world, and it has brought un-imagined wealth, comfort, and freedom not just to our own citizens, but to people throughout the world, thanks to our liberal capitalist system that encourages invention and the free exchange of ideas. Yes, it still has some flaws, but why dwell on those flaws instead of on the goodness and greatness that is America?
And please stop talking about "white privilege". Was it a privilege for neither of my parents to go to college, for one grandfather to work in a coal mine and the other to die at age 39 of a burst appendix on a cargo ship, for one grandmother to work in a textile mill all her life, and the other to clean house and raise rabbits for food during the Depression, for my first ancestor to come to this country as an indentured servant? The only privileges I and my family have are to have hard-working parents who sacrificed for their children, and to live in this great country.
I expect these words will fall on deaf ears, and in fact you probably are "shocked" that such thoughts and beliefs still exist in this state, but I believe they reflect the opinions of a silent majority in our country, and a significant minority of our remaining Californians. Please don't drive the rest of us away.
Regards,
