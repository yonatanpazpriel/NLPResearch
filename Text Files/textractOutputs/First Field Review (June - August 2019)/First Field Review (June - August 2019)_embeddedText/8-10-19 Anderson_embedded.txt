Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am upset by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I do not support even the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class. We should be putting an emphasis on how democracies work and how they fail. Your proposed Model Curriculum is clearly biased and divisive. Divisiveness is a major factor in the weakening of our democracy. The Russians recognized this in their anti-democracy campaign. Your required adult curriculum reading should be Larry Diamond's "Ill Winds: Saving Democracy from Russian Rage, Chinese Ambition, and American Complacency." I urge you to completely eliminate the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Ronald Anderson Mountain View, CA
