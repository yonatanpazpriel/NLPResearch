From: Annette Pulido Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 9:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model Ethnic Education Program - Capitalist is not oppressive.
Your intention to Equate capitalism as oppressive is wholly ignorant of the reality that it has lifted millions out of abject poverty-and contributes more to a free and democratic society than the Marxist precepts you are trying to expose(I would say poison ) California's children with (Example -India)! Your view is distorted/unfounded and renders any `educational value' devoid of the truth.
