From: lauriesculpt08 Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 10:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: I am shocked at this obvious attempt to control the hopes and dreams of our youth
Please do not attempt to edu-babble the young, pliable, impressionable minds of our future American leaders. I believe that your agenda is to systematically control and mold them into discontent and hopelessness...encouraged into dissent and negative action to further divide the uber-wealthy elitists from all others, essentially giving ultimate control to those few individuals. Please start using logic and terminology not invented with an aim towards chaos and anarchy. We owe our children a nation of hope, positivity, and encouraged success in their futures. Yes, this is not a perfect union, but change needs to be positive and promoting a bright future for all, not merely an aggrandized, negative reflection of our shortcomings. There is a dire need to inspire hope and to study our successes, and how to enlarge them to include all Americans.
