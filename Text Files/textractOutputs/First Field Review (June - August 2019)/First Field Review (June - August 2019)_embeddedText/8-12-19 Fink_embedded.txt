To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum and, in particular, its attitudes toward Jews, antisemitism, and Israel. I am a liberal Democrat but the political correctness nature of this curriculum recalls why so many middle-of-the-road Americans think that we liberals are totally out of touch and fearful of ideas that disagree with our own.
Where in this curriculum, as the Los Angeles Times editorial page has noted, are students encouraged to learn about all political perspectives? Are there never conservative arguments that might have value? How do we encourage students to express their First Amendment rights to say what they think rather than muzzle them because of their failure to follow groupspeak? Don't we liberals believe any more in Evelyn Beatrice Hall's statement, "I disagree with what you say but I will defend to the death your right to say it"?
And where is the recognition of the contributions in so many areas that one of our leading ethnic groups, American Jews, have provided to society? Where is a discussion of antisemitism and the challenges that American Jews have had to face? And what in the world does BDS have to do with the American ethnic experience? Is the curriculum similarly going to include sections on Palestinian terrorism, Chinese human rights abuses, or the denial of full societal rights to women and LBGTQ+ individuals in many Arab countries?
The study of ethnic groups and their contributions to and challenges from American society is far too important to be weighed down by political correctness and groupspeak that will merely serve further for fodder that demonstrates just how narrow and intolerant the liberal worldview has become.
