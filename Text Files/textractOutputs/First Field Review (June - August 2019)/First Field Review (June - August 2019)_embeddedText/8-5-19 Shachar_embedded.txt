The curriculum tends to proselytize and inculcate rather than open students' minds to weigh information and analyze. Choices are often funneled as though they are choices but are actually points of view already formulated. An example is when students can select to advocate for immigrant voting rights by developing arguments that would be presented at a community forum rather than perhaps taking the opposing viewpoint. There is a positive stance towards the BDS movement in the way it is characterized as having the aim to "achieve freedom through equal rights and justice." Having taught debate and also having worked with gifted students for over 10 years, I push my students to investigate both points of view, dig deep, and defend both points of view as an exercise in development of their own critical thinking skills. The curriculum needs the input of diverse perspectives from its writers and planners. It needs careful revision so that differences of opinion and perspective are respected and weighed. These are challenging, worthwhile, and relevant topics and deserve an openness to debate and discussion.
