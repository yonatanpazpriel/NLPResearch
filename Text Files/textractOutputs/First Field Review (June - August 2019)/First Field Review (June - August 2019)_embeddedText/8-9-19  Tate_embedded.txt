I object in the strongest possible terms to this so-called model curriculum. The liberal bias is overwhelming and offensive.

You attempt to portray capitalism in a negative light, by listing it alongside "patriarchy," "racism," white supremacy" and "ableism." This is not the place to argue the strengths or weaknesses of capitalism, but under no circumstances should an economic system be listed with such other terms.

This so-called model curriculum is riddled with typographical errors, falsehoods, and clear ideological biases. Please remember the role of an educator is not to push an agenda, but to present a rational, factual, and objective view of history and facts.

In conclusion, the document presented as a model curriculum is very clearly pushing a very liberal agenda. The content seems to favor social justice and political correctness over fact and actual historical events.

Ethnic studies can be a worthwhile topic if presented as an actual study, not as a tool to push a liberal agenda. Your attempts to push a liberal social agenda only cheapen the topic and lessen the value of Ethnic Studies.
