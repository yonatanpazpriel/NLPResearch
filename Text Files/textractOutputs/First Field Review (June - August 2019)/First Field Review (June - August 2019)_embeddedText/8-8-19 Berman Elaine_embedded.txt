From: Elaine Berman Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 9:57 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concern about Ethnic Studies Proposal
It is with deep concern for accuracy and clarity that we urge a revaluation of the Ethnic Studies Proposal which supports anti-semitic programs and references. It is important that accuracy and balance be applied to the material relating to all minorities and that all be treated with equal respect.
Elaine and Herbert Berman
