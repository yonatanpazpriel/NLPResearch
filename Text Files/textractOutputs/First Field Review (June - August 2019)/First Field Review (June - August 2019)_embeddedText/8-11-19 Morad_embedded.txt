From: Michelle Morad Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 4:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Angry and Against the Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As a liberal parent with progressive values, I am extremely upset by the proposed and extremely flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but implore you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. The current version is anti-Semitic and an embarrassment to all educators and a sad legacy to leave our children. I am a proud Jew who believes all peoples, religions, and culture deserve the utmost respect. The proposed curriculum is replete with anti-Semitic tropes, one-sided BDS bias, and demonization of Israel. Crucially, there is no mention of anti-Semitism. In addition, many sections in the ESMC are inaccurate, misleading and unbalanced. As the Calif. Legislative Jewish Caucus wrote, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. If you do not, you will be doing more than a disservice to our students -- you will be setting them up for a life of misunderstanding and lack of understanding of a crucial issue in our world today. It would be an incredible tragedy to see our tax dollars go to waste like this.
Thank you, Michelle Morad
