Please see the attached document. I am very concerned about the curriculum ignores the existence and experience of Jewish Americans. I am also concerned about how it highlights BDS, a movement that encourages hate and division. I am concerned that this curriculum will lead to more stigmatization of Jewish students and more antisemitism in the schools and among our youth. As a child growing up in the California public school system I experienced antisemitism firsthand and now as a parent I am concerned for my children.

Lines 9-16 - The glossary definition includes BDS which should not be in the curriculum. The glossary definition is 4x as long as any other definition in the glossary because it not only defines BDS, but it includes multiple BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campgin of hate which seeks to end Israel's existience. It is not a definition, it is anti-Israel propaganda. Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. It is not appropriate in California public schools ethnic studies curriculum. It will promote antisemitism and stigmatism of Jewish students and Israeli-American

students. There has been a rise in antisemitism locally/nationally/globally. Please do not contribute to it. In my county, a young man by the name of Ross Farca threatened to commit a mass shooting at a synagogue. He was arrested and was found to have an assault rifle, but he is out on bail. Anti-semititsm is alive and well in California and state curriculum should not encourage it : https://patch.com/california/concord-

I have numerous conerns about this section and the anti-semtic and anti-Israel sentiment that is expressed in it. I find the following area particularly offensive and misinformed: Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. A better and more accurate comparison would be U.S. policies on the border with Mexico and the U.S policies regarding European Jews World War II who tried to seek asylum in the United States but were turned away due to anti-semitism within the United States. (p. 234). Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269). Encourages students to study Linda Sarsour who has refused to Louis Farrakhan and his hate speech again Jewish people.

their families in Israel which has been completely ignored by the proposed curriculum? What if they have relatives who have been killed by a suicide bomber while they were just riding a bus on their way to work or school? What if they have relatives who escaped Nazi occupied Poland and tried to go to the United States but were denied entry and instead ended up in what is now Israel? Were they not behaving as rational actors by going someplace where they would not be murdered? This curriculum does not attempt to tell both sides of the story and does not attempt to explain an incredibly complex and long history of conflict and generations of oppression of Jewish communities in Europe and the Arab world. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. How can this lesson plan promote inclusion if it purposely excludes the Jewish community and their history? I urge the state to follow their goals of a curriculum which promotes diversity and inclusion by adding a lesson about American Jewish community as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, who have relatives who were murdered in the holocaust, have relatives who fled the tyrannical oppression and pogroms of pre-World War II anti-semitic Europe, the Arab Jewish community who were kicked out of their homelands or fled the constant oppression they faced due to their religion, and the discrimination Jewish people experienced in the former Soviet Union. Was a Jewish person on the committee that developed this curriculum? If so, please have that person explain to the Jewish community how this curriculum was developed. If not, please add a Jewish person to this committee.
