The haters believe Palestinian/Arab revisionist history based on lies about Israel. It's ironic but everything the Palestinians accuse Israel of, they themselves are guilty of, not Israel.
Arabs, in their mosques, media and schools blame the Jews for all ills in society and the world with neoNazi propaganda.
And now California is considering a curriculum which will indoctrinate students with the same libel.
