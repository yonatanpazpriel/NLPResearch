Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] I have been a Speech-Language Pathologist and educator in CA for over 40 years, both as an employee in various districts and in private practice working solely with ages 3-17. I have used the CA Curriculum as a guide when writing goals in special education. I was also on the CA licensure board for SpeechLanguage Pathology and Audiology for 8 years so have worked with professionals up and down the state. CA is almost at the bottom of the US academically in reading and writing. I fail to see how adding ethnic studies will help this dismal statistic. There are only so many minutes in a school day and many of the districts I have worked in have already been taken over by the state with mandates they cannot fulfill, thus not teaching history or science. Furthermore, using words like "power, privilege, asking students to judge their own power and privilege situation, or gender prejudices" only encourages disunity as they seek to blame others. Positive character attributes like personal responsibility and diligence to a work ethic are not even mentioned in this curriculum. These attributes are what helps students persevere regardless of their gender, ethnicity, color, background, home life or ability level.
