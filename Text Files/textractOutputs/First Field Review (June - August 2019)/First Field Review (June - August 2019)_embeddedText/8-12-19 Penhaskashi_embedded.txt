Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Including information about BDS in curriculum will promote hate against Jewish minority groups, creating a type of bias in the minds of the students. This is due to students learning about different countries boycotting trade with Israel due to differences of religion. My jewish community and myself promote a peaceful society where everyone loves each other no matter their views or religion. However, adding this information can sway the opinion of many students to have less respect for jews, therefore causing more division. Along with discussing BDS, in the second document in the pages I gave there are also mentions of anti-Israel views, which can also create biases against Zionists (people who believe Israel should be a state). If the district argues that they are including the views of all groups including those that promote BDS, I understand. However, I strongly recommend also including the American Jews as an ethnic group in order to stay along your theme of inclusion. Under this topic, I beg you to add lessons on those who fled the Holocaust, oppression against Jews in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
