From: Mary Davis Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Objection/Opposition to Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to voice my objection and opposition to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While noble in intent, the curriculum I reviewed politicizes the subject and presents it with a severe liberal ideology that lists far to the Left.
If I had children of school age, I would absolutely keep them home if/when this material is ever presented.
Simply stated, the current curriculum model is not education, but indoctrination.
Please go back to the drawing board and develop a curriculum that presents the material in a neutral, moderate manner.
Sincerely,
Mary Davis
