It's necessary for Ethnic Studies to be a graduation requirement for all California high school students to create the curriculum that will educate our students about the diverse cultures and their contributions to our society which is the only way to prepare them to live and be positive, productive members of the richly diverse world we live in. We also need to include Ethnic Studies in the general curriculum for all students from Pre-Kindergarten to post-graduate students in order to ensure that all members of our society are treated with the respect, honor, and dignity that every human being deserves. This is absolutely imperative for us to face and resolve the many problems that face us.
