The sample course models are biased towards a radical left-wing anti-American and anti-Israel world view. It would be a national disgrace and a disservice to the high school students of California to present such a slanted view without presenting alternative views. This bias appears to permeate every topic so I will not attempt to cite each example. But, for example:

p. 233, line 4940: "These negative sentiments toward Arab Americans stem primarily from ignorance, but they also reflect a troubled relationship between the US and the Arab world as a result of US imperialism." What "US Imperialism" is being referenced here? Is the Arab world not responsible in part for the "troubled relationship"?
pp. 234-235: why does the list of "significant figures" include anti-Israel activist Linda Sarsour but not Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the well-known activist in support of rights of Muslim women (who is not well-loved by the American left wing)?
p. 242, line 5176: "The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001 resulted in increased discrimination against Arabs not only among the American public, but at the level of government policy as well." To call the "Special Registration Program" a policy of "discrimination" is a perversion of that term.
Thank you for your consideration of these comments.
