I am writing in reference to Chapter 2 of the Sample Curriculum, pages 234, 237, 242, 256 and 264-269; as well as page 2 of the Glossary (BDS). I am requesting that the department remove references to BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum.
As a Jewish woman, a mother and a lifelong resident of California, I am pained to see my state's Department of Education put forward a model curriculum that would purposefully and systematically vilify the Jewish people and put my children and other children in danger.

With anti-Semitism on the rise around the world and here at home, it is shocking and appalling that the department would consider concretizing hate and antiSemitic tropes in the minds of its youth.

Nowhere in the ethnic studies curriculum about marginalized communities is there any mention of the marginalized and maligned minority of Jews. Jews were systemically murdered in the Holocaust and fled oppression in the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Several of our schools are filled with the children and

grandchildren of survivors of these atrocities. Where is the curriculum addressing our history and our stories?

Attacks against Jews in the U.S. this year reached near-historic levels. A curriculum that follows the hatred-filled rhetoric of BDS promises to contribute to that number in ways that horrify me.

The damage done by teaching thousands of children to hate Jews, to vilify them and to (wrongly, unjustly and inaccurately) associate our people with oppressors will be irrevocable. These lessons do nothing short of inspire hate for my people, and I fear for what California will become for my children if such fallacies and hateful rhetoric were taught as "truth."

BDS promotes hate and division. Its stated purpose is to delegitimize the Jewish state, vilify the Jewish people and work to eradicate the homeland of my people and the only truly safe harbor we have on this planet.

History has witnessed what insidious anti-Semitic pedagogy is capable of accomplishing. Our schools should function as a safe place to learn for all. They should function as bastions of inclusion, promoting understanding and building empathy. BDS accomplishes none of that, nor does it seek to.

This curriculum promises to sow the seeds of anti-Semitism, fostering hatred and placing Jewish children who attend public schools in California at risk of antiSemitic attacks. (The fact that the curriculum is also based in fallacy is an entirely different matter.)

Please consider the safety and well-being of all children when making your curriculum decisions. I applaud and welcome the decision to teach children what

it means to be marginalized � but not by marginalizing a select few of the children in the room.

Thank you.
