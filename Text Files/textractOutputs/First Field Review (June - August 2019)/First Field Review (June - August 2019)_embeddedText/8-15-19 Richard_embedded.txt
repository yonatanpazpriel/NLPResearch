Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Intro. p. 2, line 51. The "word" "hxrstories", according to two dictionaries is not a word and every time I see it in the Ethnic Studies Model draft I think "typo". Please do NOT "coin" words, it makes your document hard to read. p. 13 of 26 lines 306-308. It appears that this document is attempting to conflate "white supremacy" (a vile race based belief, ex: KKK) and "capitalism" (an economic and political system based on private ownership on industry and trade rather than government control.) I strongly urge the removal of "capitalism" from this paragraph of the draft document. (Comparing capitalism to socialism and showing the economic and social outcome of each system would be valid.) After reading about 20% of Chapter 2: Sample Course Models, I conclude that the current Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is much less about a broad and well balanced ethnic and cultural studies program and more about a progressive left program that makes little mention of other points of view. I recommend that the entire draft be scrapped and more inclusive program be developed that includes additional ideologies.
