From: angelajsherry Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Deep concerns about ESMC Current Draft
To the Instructional Quality Committee --
I am writing in strong support of the July 29, 2019 letter from the Jewish Caucus to your committee. As the granddaughter of two Holocaust survivors from Nazi Germany, I am deep concerns about the current draft of the ESMC, which has a glaring anti-Jewish bias. We must not institutionalize racism or negative stereotypes for any community ever, especially in our public schools, which should always be beacons of diversity and inclusion.
I attended California public schools, my child does so now, and both of my parents spent their entire careers as public school teachers and public school administrators in California. The current draft of the ESMC is simply not OK, and I urge you to discard it immediately in favor of curriculum that includes the American Jewish experience in a meaningful and respectful manner.
Thank you.
Sincerely, Angela Evans Resident, California Alumna, California public schools Parent, child in California public school Daughter of former California public school teachers and administrators Granddaughter, Holocaust survivors
