I am a Christian but believe we need to encourage cultural and religious diversity. I'm concerned that the proposed curriculum does not meet that goal.Anti-Semitism has been growing and the curriculum needs to study it's issues as well as other forms of hatred and bias. Examples are as follows: A glossary for the proposed curriculum includes a definition of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions but doesn't counter with other perspectives. p.234 Encourage teachers to highlight BDS but no voices critical of their perspective. p. 256 Encourages teachers to use a poem critical of Israel but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel There is not sufficient information about anti-Semitism.
