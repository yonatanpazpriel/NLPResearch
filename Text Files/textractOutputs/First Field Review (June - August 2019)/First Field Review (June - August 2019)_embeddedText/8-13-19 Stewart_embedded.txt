Page 1 Line 16 � Ethnic studies by definition does not "aid in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism". Portraying "students of color" and "white students" as separate classes of people based only on their skin color (i.e., race) is, by definition, racist. Page 1 Line 14 � Redefining justice as "social justice" may "empower students to be engaged socially and politically;" but it does so destructively, not constructively. It fosters divisions based on race. It portrays "students of color" as victims. It portrays "white students" as criminal aggressors, racists, and white supremacists. The division, with the anger it produces, are used to justify violence as political speech, and used to classify political speech of opposing views as violence. Case in point, "anti-fascist" protestors at UC Berkeley are themselves fascists � using physical violence to shutdown opposing points of view. Even at the college level, students have shown a widespread inability to act constructively to address "social justice." K-12 students cannot be expected to fare better. "The means represent the seed and the ends represents the tree." Don't plant this tree. It will not bring peace. Page 1 Line 22 � Stoking divisions of people based on their skin color is not loving.

Page 2 Line 25 � Ethnic studies fails to define what constitutes "ancestral roots". How many generations back define ancestral? One generation? Two? Six? Slavery has been prohibited by the United States Constitution for over 150 years; six generations if each generation is 25 years. How about 200 years? 1,000 years? 10,000 years? Go back far enough and you'll find there is only one race...the human race. DNA tells us there is only one race. The human race comes in a wide range of colors. Humans of all colors have mistreated humans of all colors throughout all times. Dividing people by skin color is a social construct created by racists to propagate racism. Continuing to differentiate people by their skin color, even as "Ethnic Studies � antithetical to racism," stokes the flames of racism and bigotry, and keeps it alive. Page 2 Line 34 � When public schools have advanced to the point where 99% of students can read at grade level, and students can comprehend the nuances of history, then the public schools can tackle advanced concepts such as "growing" an "original language." Empower all by teaching all the basics they need to teach themselves and become lifelong learners. Teach the ideal of this country's founding so that it may be realized. Do not teach division by skin color. Page 2 Line 42 � Ethnic Studies, which categorizes people based on the color of their skin, dehumanizes people. Humans come in all colors. "Indigenous" tribes of North America held slaves. African tribes held slaves. Ancient Egyptians held slaves. Inferring that the United States is unique in its enforced sociopolitical constraints based on skin color is a farce. It is a weak-minded view of history; an intentionally narrow interpretation of the causality of events to the point of willful ignorance to serve a particular political purpose. The cause of achievement gap is not racism. The cause of the achievement gap is culture. Cultures that prioritize family and value education at home have high rates of academic achievement. Cultures that do not prioritize family and do not value education at home do not. Skin color is not a factor. The sons and daughters of freed slaves had a higher percentage of English proficiency than students of today. Skin color is not the reason. "Ethnic Studies" is not the answer.

Page 3 Line 69 � There is no such thing as a hybrid human. A human is a human. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, -- That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness." Teach that. Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr. preached love of all. Teach that. Don't waste time teaching division. Teach unity. Teach of those who overcame far worse. Empower kids to make their own future by being the change they would like to see. Page 3 Line 74 � There is no such thing as a "white student." Even people with Albinism are multiple hued, not white.
Page 5 Line 114 � In Germany in the 1930s, students across the nation began calling for the establishment of the Third Reich. That was evil. Students across the nation calling for something does not make that thing intrinsically good. Page 5 Line 137 � A population that is growing larger in its majority is becoming less diverse, not more diverse. That the majority is Chicana/o and Latina/o does not make the population diverse. Global comment � As a California resident, I am deeply saddened that our education system has degraded to the point where these "Ethnic Study" proposals are taken seriously. As a parent, I am terrified. I pray my children and all others have vision enough to see though the lies and misrepresentations this "Ethnic Studies" program presents.
