To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to you to register my profound concern over the new proposed California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. As a diehard, dyed-in-the-wool liberal and progressive, I am gravely troubled by the proposed bill's one-sidedness and likelihood of suppressing political, social and cultural views differing from those reflected in the new proposed curriculum.
What California students desperately need is education about our myriad and serious political, social and cultural issues in a way that shows them how complex and nuanced these issues are before reaching knee-jerk responses based on an overly-simplified presentation of these issues. For example, while free-market laissez-faire capitalism has indeed historically been an oppressive system for most people, students need to learn that our economy (like all in the developed world) is a mixed economy, part-capitalism and part-regulation, so they can have informed opinions as to where that balance should be. Similarly, to characterize the BDS movement as a social movement "whose aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice," without indicating the widespread attack on the BDS movement as fundamentally anti-Semitic, impairs their weighing for themselves the pro and con arguments about the movement.
The proposed curriculum, by only giving California students a one-sided, over-simplified understanding of important ethnic, political and social issues, does them - and our society at large - a great disservice.
