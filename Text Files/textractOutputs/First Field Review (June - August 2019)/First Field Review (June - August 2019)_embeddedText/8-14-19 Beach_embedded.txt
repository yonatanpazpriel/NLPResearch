As a Jewish woman very invested in History and teaching this is how i feel: anti-Semitism is on the rise now and in the past this is evident all around us. Hitler started coming to power by educating with propaganda to the "YOUTH" his lies and hatred spread until he came to his real power. Do we want history to repeat it self!! This Assembly Bill 331 as a guide to educators has to be monitored so carefully and not give power to the wrong educators! We cannot indoctrinate our teens with the wrong messages about hatred, antiSemitism, and racism. They need to learn about the past and the anti-Semitism which is happening all over the world!
This is a very bad Bill 331 to send these messages to our young impressionable students!
