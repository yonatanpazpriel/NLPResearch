Page 32 of 300 When exploring historical responses to oppression and systems of power completely leaves out the rise of Hitler and the Holocaust. Our schools need to address and teach the dangers of hate groups and how they gain momentum with false narratives and dangerous rhetoric. Please include historical facts and dates into this curriculum.

Page 235 of 300, # 4970 Linda Sarsour is listed as a person of study. She is extreme in her anti-Israel opinions and unwilling to listen to any pro-Israel perspective. Her role in the formation of the Women's March is laced with controversy surrounding both financial and ethical practices. I have tried my best to review your draft and have not been able to locate any Jewish or pro-Israel (which are not synonymous) perspectives. https://www.history.com/news/gazaconflict-history-israel-palestine https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/womens-marchleadership-accused-anti-104052277.html this is where some of the false statements in the curriculum are addressed. https://www.wjcambclub.org/news/israel/sarsour-gaza-opinionhamas When Sarsour blames Israel for the plight of the Arabs living in the Gaza Strip, there is no mention of Egypt which also borders that region and does not have an open border. There is no blame on Hamas for the cruelty he leads with. Jews are a small global minority, who make up less than 0.2% of the world's population, and have endured great pain and loss of life from the horrors of the Holocaust. From the personal experience of my two children who attended public HS in Southern CA, they shockingly listened and try to correct teachers and classmate's denial of the Holocaust. That was beyond painful as their paternal great- grandparents fled Vienna in1939; bribing a guard at Dachau (concentration camp), fled with their 11-year-old daughter to a refugee camp in Shanghai until sponsored to come to America through Angel Island, San Francisco in 1941. (which is also not taught) We are experiencing a heightened increase in global anti-Semitism and hatred toward us and this part of the curriculum validates it. The lack of fact-based representation in this curriculum is deeply disturbing. Jewish Americans represent a minority group in our CA schools (documented in 2014 as 3.2%) The American Jewish community is wrongly being condemned because of controversies regarding Israel without objective representation of the facts. A few of the members of this selected advisory board for this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum appear to have a personal agenda of singling out Israel as an oppressive country and by association blaming American Jewish students. Our students deserve better than this, with multiple perspectives presented and factbased learning. Our Jewish community deserves a voice and a place in the public education and especially a curriculum model like this. Why are we not

represented? Did not one person on this selected committee see a problem with this anti-Semitic propaganda? How ironic and disturbing. We have many great role models who work tirelessly to bring about peace and global justice. https://www.record-bee.com/2019/08/09/is-californias-ethnic-studies-plan-too-politicallycorrect-even-for-california-2/ This article sums up the issues with the present draft. Please reconsider with these well thought out points in mind.

Page 237, 5030 is inaccurate as the State of Israel exists. It is not called IsraelPalestine. Hamas has never come to the two-State talks and has no interest in co-existing. Stop giving voice to false narratives- this is what is dangerous and misleading to our students. The idea that Arab countries print maps without Israel on them does not make it true. Let's all please teach facts: Israel was officially declared an independent state in May 1948. The UN approved a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and Arab state in 1947 but the Arabs rejected it. Facts matter. Teach history accurately.
