Dear Educators:
I have read your sample curriculum for Ethnic Studies. I find it abhorrent. Worse than endorsing awful jargon, it promotes the worst forms of anti-Semitism.
Because of my parents' foresight in applying for three visas to the United States in February 1938 and our family's good fortune in having an American sponsor, we escaped the terror of the extermination camps and the Final Solution. When we arrived here safely our hearts filled with utmost gratitude, despite rampant anti-Semitism in our new city, Detroit. Hitler's Third Reich is dead, but anti-Semitism lives on.
Now we see an upswing of the old right-wing anti-Semitism and an outbreak of left-wing antiSemitism by those who wish to obliterate the State of Israel, including a squad of four young Congresswomen. A discussion of the Arab ethnic group involves topics such as the Direct Action front for Palestine and BDS. Where is the discussion of attacks against the civilian population of Israel? Do the authors of this curriculum wish to guide a new generation towards anti-Semitism in ways that chillingly resemble the Nazi programs for German youth?
Beyond that, I see signs of a newer form of anti-Semitism which speaks of "punching up" against the majority group. Do these people not know that the Jewish population consists of a tiny fraction of a percent, and is highly vulnerable to the sort of hatred promoted by the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I was there when Swastika flags flew in Austria. Frankly, I am scared
