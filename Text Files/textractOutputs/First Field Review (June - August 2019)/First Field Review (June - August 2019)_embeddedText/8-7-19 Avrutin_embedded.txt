Glossary and bibliography (page 2); chapter 2 (pp.234,237,242;256;264269.) I strongly oppose current curriculum proposal and request its revision with alteration of following:
1) Withdrawal of portraying Israel as a sole source of Israeli-Palestinian conflict and an apartheid state, because it is not rooted in facts and is an opinion and an agenda item of many organizations promoting terrorism and financially benefiting from terrorism.
2) Inclusion of point of view of both sides of the conflict with introduction of the fact that there are organization in PA, whose program includes complete annihilation of Israel and who deny its legitimacy as a state.
3) Withdrawal of advancement of BDS as a constructive movement, as it seeks not justice, but destruction of Israel and further prevents the salvation of the conflict. This is in complete accord with the bill opposing BDS by US Congress that passed just recently.
4) Inclusion of Jews as a marginalized and persecuted group into the curriculum, with the discussion of anti-Semitism, Holocaust and historic facts of the formation of the state of Israel including oppression of Jews in the Middle East.

Current model of the curriculum promotes anti-Semitism which is, currently, on the rise, deepens barriers between ethnic groups and would make any member of Jewish community including my family feel unsafe in a public school environment.
