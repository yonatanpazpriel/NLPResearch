From: Deborah Klein Lopez Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
I am an elected member of the Agoura Hills City Council. As a result of my concern over the draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), I approached our Council about preparing a letter which was sent to you today, approved on a 4-0 unanimous vote.
In the letter, we expressed grave concern over the content of the ESMC as it seems to defeat the purpose for which it was created. We urged a thorough and thoughtful review of the major flaws in the curriculum, particularly as it relates to (or omits the experience of) American Jews.
In addition, I submit this letter to you as an individual, a resident of California, and a parent of three children who are of mixed race and ethnicities, of Latino and Jewish heritage.
I am personally opposed to the curriculum for reasons that are well-stated in the letters submitted to you by our Agoura Hills City Council, the Las Virgenes Unified School District, and the California Legislative Jewish Caucus.
Thank you for your consideration.
Deborah Klein Lopez, Councilmember City of Agoura Hills
