From: Charlene Beard Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model
Scrap it !
This is a biased curriculum based on socialist ideals and propaganda
It is anti Constitutional antisemitic racially motivated hate filled destructive liberal socialist ideology and propaganda
This curriculum model is politically and ideologically spun to the tune of social engineering You are attempting to-indoctrinate our children and it is unacceptable incomprehensible Within the framework you attempt to delegitimize Israel and the United States of America Its framers seek to revise and rewrite history for their own personal agenda
They no longer serve the people
It seeks to dismantle our Declaration of Independence Our Constitution and strip the people of any basic rights freedoms and core values this Nation was founded upon Endowed to us by our Creator
We have forgotten God who made us
Its framers have exchanged the Truth of God for a lie Our basic rights and core values are trampled upon This is an affront to anything good and true Gender redefined despite scientific evidence to the contrary Seriously You propagate killing the unborn by providing free unhindered abortions to 12 year olds without parental consent How can you claim to value or protect life You devalue it
This promises liberty but bring bondage Health but sickness and disease Equality but hate Where is the respect for one another You have taken it upon yourselves to sexualize and demoralize our children for your own perverted pleasure and personal gain
There is nothing healthy or sound about this
You claim intolerance to those who do not accept your worldview When in fact you yourselves are intolerant
You worship your own intellect

Your Ethnic studies exploits our children through social engineering when they are the most vulnerable to your radical extremists ideologies
Please reconsider This is insanity
Free enterprise is demonized and socialism is embraced in your model Anarchy encouraged Do you not know You yourselves are despots
Have we lost all sense of decency or moral conviction Any reasoning Have you any conscience that you would even consider perpetuating this garbage
Please reconsider implementing this curriculum Are we so politically correct that you have rendered yourselves incapable of righteous decisions based on truth
Have you not learned from history
We are an amalgam of people governed by the laws and values endowed by God Almighty and penned by our forefathers
As a nation we have prospered because of these principles and core values it was founded upon
You have forsaken the right way and gone astray
This curriculum will become a snare to you your children and your children's children You will reap what you yourselves sow
I implore you because I care . I love people our Country it's values it principles its liberty I love all peoples regardless of ethnicity I believe we are all created in the image of God and we should value life respect others and honor God Almighty I love my neighbors I believe and trust in God and His word I'm praying for you . Praying for our children I'm praying for our Country and for His mercies
Please reconsider Respectfully In love and truth
Do not forget this one thing You will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead
Whether you believe or not
We put ourselves in the place of God

Yet we are only man Repent I implore you Do righteousness Love the children more than yourselves Evil prevails when good men do nothing Respectfully I'm hoping for the best !
No disrespect intended
