From: Andrea Vassilev Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC bill must be stopped
Dear California Department of Education,
I am writing to voice my strong opposition to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC"). I am a doctoral student and am planning a family in the near future. If I am so blessed, I plan to send my children to public school in the Los Angeles Unified School District.
My tax money should not be used to support anti-Israel propaganda! Please nix the ESMC.
Best, Andrea Vassilev PsyD Doctoral Student California School of Professional Psychology Alliant International University
