Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
My wife and I, who is an educator in North Hollywood, respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel biased curriculum from the current sample course model. It is offense to me, my family and does not portray an accurate representation of the entire conflict in the region.

We also urge the board to add lessons on American Jews as an ethnic group as they are by far one of the most persecuted and vilified peoples in history. Any conversation about ethnic studies needs to just turn to history to find the scapegoat of nearly every society throughout history
