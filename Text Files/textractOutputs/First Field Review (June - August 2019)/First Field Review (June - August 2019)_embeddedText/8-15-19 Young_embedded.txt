From: Cheryl Young Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 8:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Concerns for Jews about Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply troubled by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. As a Jewish parent, I'm very concerned about this curriculum. Our children already face biases and misunderstandings from their peers and strangers who are misinformed about Judaism and Israel. We need to ensure that antisemitic stereotypes are not reinforced in the schools.
Despite the substantial contributions of Jews to California's schools, history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's continued struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. We cannot allow this exclusion, as it is completely opposite the intention of the ESMC to promote inclusion and tolerance. Specifically, the omission of any mention of antisemitism and the one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a situation where it's likely that Jewish students will be stereotyped, harassed, and unfairly judged.
I urgently request that you please make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these very important concerns.
Thank you, Cheryl Young Los Altos, CA
