I support the inclusion of Arab American history in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, particularly the sections on immigration and the dispossession of land from Palestinians. Ch. 2, p. 236, lines 4986-4990 states that "[t]his lesson introduces students to the history of Arab immigration to the United States, patterns of settlement, and issues faced by Arab Americans. This lesson plan can be used any time immigration is being discussed but is specially designed to be used in the eleventh-grade curriculum, which calls for studying immigration policy and reform and the diversifying effect of immigration on American society." As an 11th grade Ethnic Studies, English, and Geography teacher in the Bay Area, I believe it is essential that students understand patterns of immigration, especially the factors that lead to migration for marginalized groups. The model curriculum provides context to understand the complex geopolitics that led to the creation of Israel and dispersal of the Palestinian people. Ch. 2, p. 242, lines 5157-5163 explain that "[t]he largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade." There is a large, thriving Palestinian community in the Bay Area. By including their history in the model curriculum, students are able build empathy and make connections to their own family's migration narratives. The Nakba is a significant historical event that has had devastating impact on many Palestinians. It should not be silenced and must be included in the model curriculum.

I support the cause for Ethnic Studies to include Arab American studies in order to combat injustices that have been placed on the community. As referenced in chapter 2, on page 233, lines 4933-4939, Arab Americans are being targeted for things that have happened in the past.
I think that we should be learning about Arab Americans because we usually don't get their perspective; we usually only get the perspective of European Americans. I think including a course about Arab Americans will help us understand the position they are in. On page 237, lines 4921-4931 it explains how by making a course on Arab Americans it will provides a welcoming environment for them. We can learn about where they are coming from. It will also help us learn more about the world because we can't just keep learning about what the Europeans did, we have to look at other places or other kinds of people. People of color are usually marginalized, so it would help people who are usually excluded. I support the inclusion of the Arab American studies as part of the Ethnic Studies curriculum in California. In chapter 2, page 241, lines 5132-5144 clearly states, "Immigration has always been a central characteristic of the American experience" Which outlines that fact that immigration has always happen and it is part of the American history, so the idea of not having this included is not fair and are excluding. I support the incorporation of the Arab American studies. On page 237, lines 4921-4931 this whole section talks about how they adapted to the world when immigrating. A similarity is that my family also went through same struggles. It would also be nice to learn about other ethnicities and not similar ones. I think it is important that we can learn about different studies.
