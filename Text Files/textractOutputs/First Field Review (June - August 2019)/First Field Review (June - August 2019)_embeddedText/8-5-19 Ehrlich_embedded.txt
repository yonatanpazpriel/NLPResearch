[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] The sample lesson plans, while well-intended, present extraordinary proPalestinian and anti-Jewish biases as they: -Highlight BDS and the pro-BDS group Direction Action for Palestine but offer no critique of these groups biased perspectives [p.234] -Present a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering its communities in order to murder innocent people and U.S. border policies with Mexico [p. 234] -Support the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War without offering an alternative Israeli perspective [p. 242] -Imply that `Israel-Palestine' is an Arab country [p. 237] -Encourage the use of a poem that harshly criticizes Israel but do not include any criticism of Palestinian leaders nor present any positive view of Israel [pp. 256, 264-269] -Does not present any lesson about the Jewish community, in itself a small minority group. This is extremely disturbing given the rise of antisemitism in our country and worldwide and the widespread ignorance about the Jewish people who have made crucial contributions to the betterment of society.

I would urge you to add lessons about American Jews, a small minority ethnic group, and include the perspectives of those who fled genocide in Germany during the Holocaust and those who suffered oppression, even death, in the Middle East and in the former Soviet Union.
