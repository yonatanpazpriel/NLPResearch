From: Shelly Malinow Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern, I am deeply concerned and disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes that Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and promotes boycotts against Israel.
I strongly suggest that you remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and any anti-Israel bias from this curriculum. I actually urge you to add lessons about American Jews who fled the Holocaust, add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism, and speak to the advances in science and medicine brought about by Jews in American and Europe.
Thank you for listening, Shelly Malinow
