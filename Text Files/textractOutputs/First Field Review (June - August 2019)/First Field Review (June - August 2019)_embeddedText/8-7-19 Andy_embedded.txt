From: Librarians for Fairness Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 10:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The New Ethnic Studies Curriculum Is Anti-Semitic & Clearly Biased Against Israel
Dear Ms. Chao: As librarians, archivists, and academics, we at Librarians for Fairness strongly protest against this
unacceptable curriculum for California's students. Its bias against Israel, the only democracy in the Middle East is apparent, as is its downplaying of the contributions of Jews. It is anti-Semitic and should be promptly scrapped.
Sincerely yours, Leon Andy. M.A., M.L.S. Coordinator, Librarians for Fairness
