Concerns with proposed curriculum
� Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned. � Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-
based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. � The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no
balancing perspective.
