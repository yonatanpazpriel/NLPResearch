� I am asking for the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. You can look to pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 for examples. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antiSemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
�
� The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:

� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).

� Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
� Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
� Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
� Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
The state should include lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. As an 8th grade English teacher, these lessons will go against everything I teach my students about tolerance. My students are much more empathetic towards Jewish suffering and victimization after learning about Anne Frank's story. These anti-Semitic lessons will only serve to unravel my lessons and cause irreparable harm.
