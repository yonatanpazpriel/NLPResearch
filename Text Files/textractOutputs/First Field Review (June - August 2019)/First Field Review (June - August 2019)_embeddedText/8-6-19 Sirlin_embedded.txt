RE:
2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
Dear Sirs:
The above proposed curriculum is severely fundamentally flawed.
It is not proper to teach about the BDS movement with respect to Israel without adequate background. The background should include:
(1) The long history of murderous oppression of the Jewish people, which created the need for a Jewish homeland.
(2) The extreme difficulty of implementing a solution that meets the needs of both Israel and the Palestinian people.
(3) The growing antisemitism in many countries.
Thank you for carefully considering these issues.
Philip J. Sirlin
