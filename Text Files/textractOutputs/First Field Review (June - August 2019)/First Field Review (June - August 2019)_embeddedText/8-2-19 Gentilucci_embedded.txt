I am writing to express my deep concern about adding "ethnic studies" to the extant K-12 curriculum. I am a retired professor of education and a research specialist with more than 41 years of experience with K-12 education. As such, I want to make the reviewers aware of weaknesses in the so-called "research" upon which this effort is predicated.
First, ANY research sponsored by an advocacy group such as the National Education Association is suspect, and I urge you not to ignore the obvious confirmation bias present in NEA's position papers because the leadership of this organization is ideologically invested in finding evidence that supports its political goals.

Second, the NEA report's author, Dr. Christine Sleeter, is a critical pedagogist. She is a self-described social justice, racial, and ethnic "activist," and her work must be read in that light. Moreover, the study by Dr. Sleeter is methodologically weak. Upon careful reading, you will note that it is merely a review of "selected" literature from the fields of social justice, racial/ethnic studies, and critical pedagogy, NONE OF WHICH has been empirically proven to improve K-12 student academic achievement. The outcomes of this body of work are agenda-driven and "fuzzy" at best. At worst, they are an attempt to present solipsistic self-reports as rigorous academic research findings.

In closing, I wish to state that I support culturally responsive teaching that promotes healthy diversity. This is where the Department of Education should focus its efforts--NOT on the addition of dubious "ethnic studies" courses in the K-12 curriculum.

Thank you for considering these comments.
