This is not good education. Commercialism is not a bad thing. In fact it has helped many out of poverty. People of all races have bennefitted in our country from commercialism. It is now also helping people in poor nations to be able to support their families.
Israel has a right to exist as a nation and as such has the right to protect itself. The U.S. should continue to support Israel.
Do not have a cop killer to basically mentor our children to follow radical ideology & join in groups who are anti-semitic, and are against law enforcement and others.
Please shift your focus to teaching the Constitution; the Bill of Rights; as well as English, writing, math, history, and science. Our children are poorly taught and have a long way to go to come back to being at least toward the top and not toward the bottom of the heap of the world's educated children. We should include the 10 Commandments as a guild to morality as I strongly believe this would reduce the amount of violence in our schools & elsewhere in our country.
Thank you for this opportunity to express my views & to take them into your consideration.
Respectfully,
Sharon Sweet
