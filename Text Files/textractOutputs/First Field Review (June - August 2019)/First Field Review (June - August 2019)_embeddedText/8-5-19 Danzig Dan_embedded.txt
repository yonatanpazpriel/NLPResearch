The glossary provides a definition of the Boycott, Divestment and

Sanctions movement which describes it as a social movement

whose mission is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions".
Merriam- Webster defines apartheid as "a former policy of segregation and political and economic discrimination against non-European groups in the Republic of South Africa". Hence, the reference to "apartheid conditions" is factually incorrect as Arab Israeli's of Palestinian decent participate in all facets of Israeli society including as members of Israel's parliament (where Arabs generally hold between 10% to 15% of all seats), several Supreme Court Members, Professors, Physicians, Police Officers, Actors, Singers, attend the same universities and classes as Jewish Israeli's, etc. In short, Israeli Arabs participate in every facet of Israel's economy, educational system, government and society in numbers reflecting their overall percentage in the general population.
It is also important that the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement definition contained in the glossary misrepresents the true purpose of this movement. The following are direct quotes for Omar Barghouti the founder of the BDS movement.
"[Palestinians have a right to] resistance by any means, including armed resistance. [Jews] aren't indigenous just because you say you are....[Jews] are not a people...the UN's principle of the right to self-determination applies only to colonized people who want to acquire their rights. "
"Good riddance! The two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is finally dead. But someone has to issue an official death certificate before the rotting corpse is given a proper burial and we can all move on and explore the more just, moral and therefore enduring alternative for peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Mandate Palestine: the one- state solution."

"(The one state solution means) a unitary state, where, by definition, Jews will be a minority."
"A Jewish state in Palestine in any shape or form cannot but contravene the basic rights of the indigenous Palestinian population and perpetuate a system of racial discrimination that ought to be opposed categorically....Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine."
This is just a sample of quotes by Mr. Barghouti, there are dozens more from him and other leaders of this movement, that clearly demonstrate that the true goal of the BDS movement is not a fight for Palestinian rights, but the destruction of the State of Israel, the lone democracy in the Middle East and the world's only Jewish nation. Finally, as of 2016 the U.S. State Departments definition of contemporary acts of Anti-Semitism include the following:
 Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.
 Applying double standards (to Israel) by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.
As such, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement is at its heart a hateful, Anti-Semitic movement which seeks to deny thousands of years of Jewish history connecting the Jewish people to their native land and advocates for the destruction of a nation and its people.

Pg. 234, line number 4956 & 4957.
This section encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a Pro-BDS group Direct Action for Palestine. As the BDS movement is at is heart a hateful, Anti-Sematic movement, this is a grossly inappropriate lesson that does not even offer voices critical of this perverse perspective. Pg. 234, line number 4958.
This section promotes a false equivalency between Israels attempts to stop suicide bombers and terrorists who have killed thousands of Jewish, Muslim and Christian Israeli's since the 1990's and the United States efforts to regulate unauthorized and non-violent immigration. Pg. 237, line number 5030.
This unclear verbiage implies that Israel-Palestine is a country (it is not) and that its origin is Arab which again is historically incorrect. Pg. 242, Line # 5157 � 5163.
This section frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 conflict as fact without providing any alternative perspectives. Pg. 256, Line # 5477 � 5483.
This section encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective of Israel nor any criticism of the Palestinian leadership included their repeated rejection of peace offers and Anti-Semitic comments and policies. It is hard to comprehend how a US ethnic studies curriculum could exclude American Jews from the curriculum. I strongly urge the State to add sections about the American Jews including those who fled the
