Introduction Kathleen Conrey Educator

The introduction section of this proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to...enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."
However, this proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. In addition It openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry.

Glossary p2

BDS definition is inaccurate and biased. BDS and" "Direct Action for Palestine promote hate and division rather than inclusion.

Conclusion Kathleen Coney

Language is unclear: It is implied that "Israel-Palestine" is an Arab country.
Treats the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact. No alternative perspectives are included.
Poem which is promoted uses harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of of Palestinian leaders.
This educational effort is meant to teach students about marginalized communities and to develop appreciation for cultural diversity and eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism. Despite this goal the proposed curriculum mentions Jews only in passing.
Ignorance about the Jewish people gives rise to antisemitism, which is a major problem in our society.
