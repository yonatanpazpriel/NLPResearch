General comment: I am glad to read that the Department of Education has decided to take a second look at this curriculum. Because the curriculum will be reexamined, it probably makes sense for me to give general comments, knowing that others presumably have commented on the specifics of the (now-to-berevised) curriculum.
I was very alarmed when I originally heard of this curriculum, as it seemed as if the Department was putting its imprimatur behind a one-sided presentation on issues involving Israel and the Middle East more broadly. Indeed, it sounded as if the curriculum could have been written by any of several anti-Israel activist groups whose stated mission is the destruction of the state of Israel. In this way, the curriculum would, in effect, have come out in favor of the position that Israel, alone among all nations, has no right to exist and should be destroyed. While there are significant legal and public policy reasons why the BDS movement should be considered to be anti-Semitic, there is no opposing voice referred to in the curriculum, and BDS is presented as if it is an unalloyed positive thing.

While this curriculum is to be an ethnic studies curriculum, oddly it contains no reference, other than in passing, to the Jewish community, nor does it deal with the historical and very real present-day issues of anti-Semitism, which of course provided part of the backdrop for the origins of the Zionist movement in the 19th century, and for the founding of the State of Israel in the 20th century. Seeing what is going on in the US and elsewhere today (including in Poway), it certainly cannot be said that the era of anti-Semitism is behind us.
I am a concerned member of California's Jewish community, and so it was the treatment of issues related to the Jewish people and to Israel that originally caught my attention and caused me to look into this. But Jews are not the only minority community ignored or given short shrift in this curriculum. Indians, Hindus, Koreans, Armenians, Greeks and Coptic Christians also receive very little (if any) attention, despite the fact that all these minority groups are present in California today.

I also understand that capitalism is treated, in this curriculum, as being a form of power and oppression, along with racism and white supremacy. I would have thought that a balanced presentation would note that capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty, worldwide, than any other form of economic system.

I am sorry to say that this curriculum gives off the impression that it was not written by educators seeking to actually educate their students, but rather by partisan activists intent on indoctrinating their students in the very latest ideas fashionable in the activist communities within college faculty lounges and elsewhere in society. I hope that you will, indeed, take a serious second look at the entire curriculum.
