I would like to express my thoughts about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which addresses crucial issues pertaining to the core groups of Black/Africans, Native Americans, Chicanos and Asian Americans, as well as the inclusion of Arab Americans and Pacific Islanders. It is very commendable that the last two groups have been added to the core group, but it is very surprising and disappointing that the Armenian American community has been excluded from this very important educational project. Armenian American immigrants have been a very influential segment of our nation who despite experiencing XENOPHOBIA have been able to integrate into the fabric of this nation, bringing forth significant contributions in all aspects of the American experience. They have come in waves of immigration for over a century, fleeing massacres and Genocide at the hands of the Ottoman and the Young Turk governments, and later escaping from countries in the Middle East who had given them refuge, because of political and social upheavals in those countries. Armenians have proven themselves to be loyal and resourceful citizens who have contributed to many significant advancements. Just to cite a few examples: G. Kazanjian invented the hair dryer Varaztad H. Kazanjian pioneered plastic surgery Stephen Stepanian invented the truck-mounted concrete mixer Peter Halajian manufactured the Mounds candy bar Asadour Sarafian co-invented the automatic transmision Arshile Gorky was one of the founders of abstract expressionism Rouben Mamoulian was a film and theater director Alex Manoogian invented the Delta faucet William Saroyan was a famous American writer Victor Maghakian, Ernest Dervishian were WWII heroes Hampar Kalidian was an orthopedic surgery pioneer who saved Senator Bob
Dole's arm when he returned from war as a young soldier Kirk Krikorian was an industrialist and philanthropist Alan Hovhaness was an American composer Steven Derounian was a US congressman Rostom Bagdasarian created Alvin and the Chipmunks Mike Connors was a film and TV actor

Unfortunately, Armenians have been the most neglected and obscure immigrant group in the US because of geopolitics associated with our nation's alliance with Turkey. Armenian students have had the heartache of learning world history where their ancestry and Genocide at the hand of Ottomans/Turks were literally erased from the pages of the History books they had to study. The Armenian Genocide education is now mandated in California schools, which is a significant progress towards including historically accurate information and is conducive to fighting against "man's inhumanity to man" in our country and across the globe by educating students across our state, and hopefully across our nation in the near future. I am reaching out to you for the purpose of ensuring that the Armenian Immigrant Story is included in your plan, for the reasons stated above and because the story of the Armenian immigration from across the world, the resilience in the face of discrimination and xenophobia, and the significant contributions to our country by the Armenian immigrants over the past decades cannot be brushed over and neglected. The Armenian story is the story of the American hope and triumph in the face of the adversities that immigrants and minorities have faced in our country.
