From: Matt Glickman Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Input to Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by parts of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from a number of groups who are attempting to create a diverse, inclusive but fair and accurate curriculum.
I support diversity and inclusion, but oppose a curriculum that "erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools."
Please proceed with your important curriculum but revise it in a way that addresses shortfalls in this early draft. This isn't about tilting the scale towards one group - it's about ensuring that everyone gets fair treatment.
Thank you, Matt Glickman Palo Alto, CA
