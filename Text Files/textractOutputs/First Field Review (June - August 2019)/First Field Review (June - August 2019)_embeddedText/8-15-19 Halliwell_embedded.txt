I only heard about this yesterday, so did not have a chance to fully read your Model Curriculum; but after glancing at the outline, glossary and a few suggested exercises; I have a few observations.
The idea of teaching ethics in high school along with history is good. However, the appears to be areas that I wouldn't consider ethics and it appears to be biased in certain areas. For example, I don't understand the relationship of `power' to ethics; there is power everywhere; some ill-gotten; some not; some should be respected (like your boss); some overturned. People have choices of how to deal with power; which gives them power over their own situation. Why is a discussion of Capitalism with discussion of power. Socialism and Communism are also forms of power. All governmental and economic systems are systems of power; one's own power lies in having choices to decide under which system to live. Why do thousands of people every year risk their lives trying to get to the US? Also, in discussion of equal treatment of everyone; why would you talk about reparations for black slavery; while not even acknowledging the hundreds of thousands of white men who died trying to eliminate slavery? It is very complex to analyze two year old history without a complete knowledge and study of the times. Those slaves descendants now live in the free US; not in Africa. Why do you seemingly support BDS, when that organization works against Israel? That seems in contradiction to the equal treatment philosophy. Children need to taught history and facts, so they can analyze and make their own judgements. Ethics is about Integrity; Honesty; the Golden Rule; not dictating philosophy.
How can I hear about proposed changes in the CA School Curriculum with more time to respond to Requests for Public Comments Thank You, Janet Halliwell
