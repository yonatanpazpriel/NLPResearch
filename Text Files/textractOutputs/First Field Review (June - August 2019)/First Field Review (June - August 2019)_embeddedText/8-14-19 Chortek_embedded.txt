From: Chortek, Robert L. Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 2:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Chortek, Robert L. Subject: Opposition to Draft ESMC.
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As a concerned California citizen, I took the time to read the draft ESMC. I was very disturbed by what I read and urge you not to approve the draft without major revisions.
I firmly believe in diversity and inclusiveness. We should encourage our youth to be tolerant and accepting of people's differences. After reading the draft, however, I felt the proposed curriculum focused far too much on "victimhood" and undermined the idea of personal responsibility.
I was also disturbed by the omission of any discussion of antiSemitism, especially since there has been a large rise in the number of anti-Semitic attacks in the United States in recent years. The draft has an anti-Israel bias and is anything but even handed in the discussion of the Arab Israeli conflict.
I urge you not to approve the current draft without major revisions.
Thank you,
Robert L. Chortek San Jose, California
