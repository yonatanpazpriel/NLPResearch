From: John Phillips Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:48 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom this may concern,
Thank you for your hard work in developing curriculum for our public schools. However I request that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum not be implemented. Curriculum should provide teachers material to inform students and teach actual history. The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will indoctrinate students, forcing them to agree to politically correct leftist views of society. This must not be used in our California public education system.
Sincerely, John Phillips Vacaville , CA
