From: The Review Institute Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 12:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ca ethnic studies course promotes antisemitism
I am appalled that CA public school system is presenting this ethnic studies program that supports BDS who its agenda is to destroy the State of Israel by isolating it economically, culturally and politically. The State of California should not be teaching its young students one side only in an international conflict. It casts Israel as an oppressor. This can backfire and cause extreme antisemitism in California and USA>
Please take into this matter seriously and stop this immediately, Thank you! -Rachel Bond Social Media Specialist The Review Institute
