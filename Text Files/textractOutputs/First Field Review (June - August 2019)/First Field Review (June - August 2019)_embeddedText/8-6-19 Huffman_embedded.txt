Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Lines 306 & 307
I am a capitalist. I had a corporate career. I own stocks and bonds issued by companies. In the referenced lines you group capitalism as a form of power and oppression along with racism and anthropocentrism, among other evils. Do we want to tell our children that capitalism is ipso facto evil? Yes, it has been used to oppress people of color. At the same time many such people have benefited from the opportunities that good privatesector jobs provide. What about people of color who are capitalists? Is a socialist society somehow less oppressive? I think you need to give this language more thought.
