My thoughts can be best described by this LA Times article: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-02/californias-new-ethnic-studies-curriculum I believe it is wrong for California to source a mainstream public state curriculum required for graduation only from one side of the spectrum from radical Marxist activists. Teach kids to think, not brainwash them to one sided ideology. We can do better than this for the children of California!
