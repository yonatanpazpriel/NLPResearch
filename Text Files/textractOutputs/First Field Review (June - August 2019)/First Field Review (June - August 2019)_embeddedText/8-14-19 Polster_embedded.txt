To Whom It May Concern, I sincerely hope you will re-draft your existing proposal with a different group of authors. I have been a Carlsbad home owner for 31 years and this proposal is very troubling to me. It's true I am Jewish and I feel this curriculum is extremely anti Semitic. I feel we need to teach tolerance in our schools and in our lives and not this divisiveness. I ask you to please reconsider this proposal as I feel it will do much more harm than good. Sincerely Gary Polster Carlsbad CA.
