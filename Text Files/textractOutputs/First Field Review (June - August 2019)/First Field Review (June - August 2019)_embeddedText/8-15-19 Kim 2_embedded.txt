Overall suggestion to include Korean American as part of the overall American Experience. With the first Korean to become a naturalized American Citizen, Phillip Jaison in 1890, the first married couple, Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and Helen Lee arrived in 1902, and the mass wave of immigrants arrived in 1903, Korean Americans have become a thriving part of this county's progress and prosperity, serving as a significant mediator for the strong economic, political, and cultural alliance between United States and Korea. The United States is home one of the largest diaspora of Koreans in the world.
