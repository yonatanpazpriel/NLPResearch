Hi folks,
I am forwarding you an email that I sent to Shawn Hubler of the Sacramento Bee in April 2018.

Dear Ms. Hubler,
I just read the following on the SacBee website:
http://www.sacbee.com/opinion/california-forum/article207873999.html
I found the following paragraph particularly interesting:
----------------------------------------------
A 2016 Stanford University study showed that ethnic studies courses helped high school students increase their educational outcomes, attendance and credits earned. Researchers discovered that students' GPAs improved by 1.4 grade points, attendance rose 21 percentage points, and class credits earned increased by 23.
----------------------------------------------
Since you were kind enough to link a summary of the study in the article, I went and read it.
Here's a relevant quotation:
------------------------------------------------
The researchers found that attendance for those encouraged to enroll in the class increased by 21 percentage points, GPA by 1.4 grade points and credits earned by 23.
-------------------------------------------------

That would seem to support Mr. Alejo's apparent contention that such a requirement would be generally beneficial to *all* students - except for the fact that the study actually does something which Mr. Alejo fails to do and specify the group studied. The study focused on students close on either side of a 2.00 and the gains "particularly concentrated among boys and Hispanic students."
This is exactly what I would have expected. Actually paying attention to at-risk students and making them feel like they matter is probably going to have good results.
That does not mean that it generalizes to the student body as a whole. In fact, compelling students to take a class in ethnic studies would probably be more likely to be counter-productive since people already whine about taking things like math classes - which *should* be mandatory. Courses in ethnic studies should be offered but should generally remain voluntary (I have no objection to an intervention for at-risk youth).
I don't know if Mr. Alejo was attempting to be misleading by deliberately omitting relevant information but, as I've complained to previous editorial page editors, just because something is an opinion piece that doesn't mean it should be exempt from basic fact-checking.
Best wishes, Donald D. deRosier
