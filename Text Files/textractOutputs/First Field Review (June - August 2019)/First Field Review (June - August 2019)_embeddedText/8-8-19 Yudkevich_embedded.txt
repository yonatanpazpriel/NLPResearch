Kenneth McDonald Education Programs Consultant
Dear Mr. McDonald I was notified by my synagogue about preparation educational program that promotes BDS movement. I said promotes, because, by my opinion, any mentioning that movement without linking to hate ideology like similar ones communism and Nazi, is promotion. Today I found on Internet fresh track of existing in USA anti-Semitism: "FBI announces $20,000 reward for information about fires at Chabad centers"
https://abcnews.go.com/US/fbi-announces-20000-reward-information-fires-chabadcenters/story?id=64821795 Also, I am visiting synagogue in Poway, neighbor to one that recently was attacked and woman was killed. According to organizations monitoring anti-Semitism, that movement on the rise in entire World and in USA, especially in schools and academic institutes. Let me refer to great person Jonathan Sacks ( http://rabbisacks.org/ ). Recently he had speech before Britain parliament about the rise and danger of anti-Semitism in Europe. His opinion is that anti-Israel activity is the modified form of anti-Semitism. It is hard to believe that movement for destroying of Israel state can be discussed in any reasonable way. Population of Israel is about 8 million persons, that gathered there because it is historical Jewish Land and because living in other places led to full disappearance of Jewish nation. If state of Israel is destroyed where to those people move? Most likely they will be killed by their neighbors and other Jewish haters. So, where is the ground for rational discussion of that problem? I cannot see it. Let me do one more citation: " The real aim of BDS is to bring down the state of Israel" As'ad AbuKalil, professor of political science, anarchist, and BDS leader, University of California.
Sincerely, Ilya Yudkevich
