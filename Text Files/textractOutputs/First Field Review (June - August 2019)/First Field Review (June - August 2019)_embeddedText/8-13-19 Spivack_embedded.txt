I have read about the proposed curriculum at the California high schools regarding Ethnic studies. I find it disgusting that these studies are more directed toward bigotry and hatred then the understanding of the real issues that are facing ethnic groups. In particular I find disgusting that specific programs are proposed which are totally political in nature rather than discussing the issues regarding this ethnic hatred and control rather than addressing these issues in a non political and more intellectual manner. answer program now stands I feel strongly that it should not be approved and that much more work needs to be done to make this program more inclusive and less political.
Sincerely, Bruce Spivack
