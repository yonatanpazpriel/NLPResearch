1. While I applaud the goal of increasing students' knowledge of and sensitivity to the issues of ethnicity, prejudice, and discrimination against minorities, I strongly disagree with the initial draft of the ESMC. The reasons are two fold:
1. Absence: The ESMC completely ignores any reference to the Jewish experience in America, to the Jewish immigration and to antisemitism.
While many ethnic and religious groups are addressed, any mention of the Jewish group is glaringly absent. Similarly, any mention of antisemi-
tism and discrimination against the Jews is nowhere to be found. For such an important topic, which unfortunately still exists in America today, to be totally ignored is unacceptable. Its omission from the ESMC is,
by itself, an indication of bias, and is totally unacceptable. 2. There are inaccurate, misleading and inflammatory "facts" concerning
the Palestinian immigration to America. There are also hateful and ignorant references to Israel. I will detail these misleading information in my
next paragraph.

The model curriculum aptly lists the hallmarks of Oppression, the 4 I's: Institutional, Ideological, Interpersonal and Internalized. It aptly cites Dehumanization, Xenophobia, White Supremacy, and the social movements against them as key topics of the course. Yet there is no mention of antisemitism!!!
Lists BDS, (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) against Israel as a worthy "social movement" against oppression. It completely ignores its hateful and biased stand against the democratic, multi ethnic country of Israel. A country born out of the evils of antisemitism.

Lists 3 prominent politicians leading BDS in America, (Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar), all openly making antisemitic and inflammatory statements. It also lists the late Helen Thomas who called for American Jews to "go back to Poland", the country in which millions of Jews were massacred during the Holocaust.
Uses the word "Nakba", the anti Israel term for the 1948 War of Independence. It misses the opportunity to address the precursors of the war, and by so doing it shows ignorance and anti Jewish bias.

Provides a misleading, biased and anti Jewish definition to the 1948 War of Independence. Providing a one-sided explanation of the so called Nakba. It erroneously refers to the 1948 War of Independence as the "1948 Palestinian War". This is extremely biased, antisemitic, hateful and ignorant misstatement of facts. It also misses the glaring absence of any reference to antisemitism, and to Jewish freedom movements. It reflects a hateful bias against the Jews, their persecution, and their quest for self determination and freedom. It is also ignorant of the 1947 United Nations Resolution for the Partition of Mandatory Palestine between Jews and Palestinian Arabs. A Resolution accepted by the Jews but rejected by the Arabs. Following their rejection of the UN Resolution armies of all Israel's neighbors attacked the Jewish State, thus opening the first Arab-Israeli war of 1948.

These are instances of blatant antisemitic and defamatory stereotypes against Israel and against Jews, many of them are Holocaust survivors or descendants of survivors, and Jews who were forcibly expulsed from Arab countries for being Jewish. These are statements, songs and other slogans all inciting against a people and against a nation. Statements of hatred and vengeance. Statements of distorted historical facts, in which Jews, an oppressed and persecuted minority, are dehumanized and defamed as oppressors, colonialists and racist.
