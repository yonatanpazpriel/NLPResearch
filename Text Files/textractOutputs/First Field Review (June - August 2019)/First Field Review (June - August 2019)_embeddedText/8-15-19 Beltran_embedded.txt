From: Celia Beltran Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 5:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ETHNIC STUDIES PROPOSED CURRICULUM
I sincerely hope that you reject this proposed curriculum. This is nothing but a political agenda that is divisive, racist, anti-capitalism and anti-semitic. How about teaching logic in Math instead of making a child think, "Am I only a statistic?" Social justice has its place but not in the curriculum intended to radicalize young minds. This proposal does not belong in the public schools. OPPOSE!
