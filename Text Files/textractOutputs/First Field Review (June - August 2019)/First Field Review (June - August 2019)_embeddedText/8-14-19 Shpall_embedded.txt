P.22, lines 30-40 BDS The representation of BDS is one-sided omitting facts. BDS is a movement to isolate Israel. Arabs living in Israel have full privileges and rights including the right to vote; most visitors to Israel and scholars would dispute the use of the word "apartheid."
P.233 line I disagree with the term "U.S. Imperialism" as if it's an accepted fact.
P.236 lines 5008-9 and P. 239 lines 5078-5083 Comparative border studies between Israel and Mexico is a specious argument. The U.S is trying to make the borders safe and offer humanitarian aid to migrants. Israel works to stop terrorists at the border from entering the country to slaughter their people .
P.237 5030 "Israel-Palestine" There is no state or country of Palestine. The area is Israel, a Jewish state, with lands that were bought and given legal status through international recognition.
P. 242 lines 5157-5161 give a one sided, non-historic view, of what occurred after Israel declared its independence, and it omits many facts. Arab leaders advised Arabs to leave their homes, and 5 Arab armies attacked Israel.

like victims instead of encouraging them to take responsibility for themselves and be optimistic about accomplishing their goals.
p. 263 line 5656 rap song It is untrue that Arabs cannot shop at "these malls" in Israel. Arabs are free to move about and shop wherever they wish. This is another example of how there is no apartheid in Israel.
This curriculum needs to be factual and historically accurate, and it should not depict a one sided, victim promoting, and politically correct bias. Please refrain from using politically fashionable jargon
