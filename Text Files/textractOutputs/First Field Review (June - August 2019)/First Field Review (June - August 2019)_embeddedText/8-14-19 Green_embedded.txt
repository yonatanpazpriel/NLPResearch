From: Norm Green Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies and California History
The published summaries of a proposed ethnic studies curriculum are in some respects outrageous.
California students ought to learn about the various ethnic groups in California and how they have impacted our state in so many ways. Issues that arise should not use curriculum that is designed to be utterly biased.
Unfortunately currently, almost no California students are exposed to any California history after 4th grade. Such a course ought to be required, and it ought to include ethnic studies.
