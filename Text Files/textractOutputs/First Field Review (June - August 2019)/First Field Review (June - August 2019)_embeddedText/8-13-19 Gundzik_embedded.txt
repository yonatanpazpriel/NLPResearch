I write to oppose the proposed curriculum. It excludes the Jewish-American experience, neglects discussion of anti-Semitism, and highlights the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement launched against Israel." There is no indication that the Israeli-Palestinian issues have two sides. This at a time when anti-Semites are marching in Charlottesville, shooters are going into synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway, and the California Attorney General's Office reports that hate crimes against Jews in California increased more than those against any other group in 2018.
