Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum leaves out and erases the Jewish experience in California. This is offensive! By excluding the experience of one group � the curriculum is offensive to all groups. The curriculum purports to cover bigotry but omits antisemitism. It denigrates Israel and Jews and supports the antisemitic BDS movement. Our schools are being hijacked by interest groups who wish to promote their agenda and not true liberal education for California students.
