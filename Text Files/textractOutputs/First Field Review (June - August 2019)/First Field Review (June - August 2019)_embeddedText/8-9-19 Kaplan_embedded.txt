I am concerned that the range of the Ethnic studies proposals is too broad to be effective. I would submit that, tailoring the syllabus to the ethnic makeup of the local student body is in itself culturally insensitive. There are a few universal examples, which are apropo to the California experience, that could be focused on, such as the appropriation of California from Mexico by the (Anglo-European) US, the destruction of the native American culture by the Spanish invaders. There is a "victim" mentality running through the whole endeavor contributing to my perception of a one-sidedness of the curriculum, for example the notable exclusions of successful groups such as East Indian and Persian ethnic groups in California. I think there is co-mingling of different concepts here, reflected by the usage of "gender neutral" grammatical constructs. This is Ethnic studies, not gender studies.

One point which I fail to see adequately addressed is the balance of cause and effect over time. Neighborhoods aren't just created; they evolve. Political and prejudice, likewise. Concepts like "The Holy Land", "Jerusalem in America", "Divine Right" led to real events, catastrophic to the natural order of the native populations all over the world. I think maybe that is the most salient lesson which needs to be taught. The idea behind Ethnic studies, as presented here, doesn't seem to reflect that at all. This program seems to glorify ethnicity at the cost of attaining wisdom.
