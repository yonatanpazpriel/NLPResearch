I'm scared for what will happen if the curriculum, as it is now, were to be taught in public high schools all across California. First off, as an ethnic studies course, it disregards Jews as part of an ethnic minority. Throughout the curriculum, the topic of racism Islamophobia are continuously brought up, as it should be because they are very serious terrible things. However, the word anti-semitism is brought up less than ten times. This is very concerning , as it is a form of racism that isn't being acknowledged in an "ethnic studies" course. It is also very concerning to me that blatantly anti-semetic groups, BDS, are being promoted. This is a problem because if this curriculum is taught in public high schools of California, students will be taught with an underlying message that anit-semitism is not a form of racism, and therefore okay. Lastly, this curriculum fails to shine light on the thousands of years of Jewish history and persecution, and disregards the fact that the Jewsih people are indigious to the Land of Israel. Please consider all of the harm this curriculum could bring.
