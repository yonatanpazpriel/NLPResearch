From: therese mughannam Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 12:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: INCLUSION OF ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
Including Arab American studies in curriculums taught in California is more vital now than ever before. Not just studies of Arab history and culture, but also of other minorities who are being marginalized now in our country. It is the only way to train our children to be not only tolerant of other cultures, but also appreciative of others' histories and contributions to humankind.
Thank you. Therese Mughannam
