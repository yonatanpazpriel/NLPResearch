Page 49, et seq. References to police "brutality" are inaccurate, conclusory, inflammatory and misleading. At a minimum, the word "brutality" should be replaced throughout the entire document with the words, "Use of Force." (E.g., "Police Use of Force"). The application of force by a police officer is often appropriate, necessary and legal. It is certainly incorrect to label all use of force as "brutality" which this draft document does.
