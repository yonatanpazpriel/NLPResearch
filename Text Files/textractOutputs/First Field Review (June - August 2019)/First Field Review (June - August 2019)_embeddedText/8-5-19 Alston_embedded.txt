Really? This course is a joke, right?
As a resident of California, I find this so radical and has no place in our schools. capitalism lifts up people and provides opportunity and is the opposite of what you are waning to teach.
You do this, we all just ouch For vouchers and private school to get away from this fascist idea of the world.
