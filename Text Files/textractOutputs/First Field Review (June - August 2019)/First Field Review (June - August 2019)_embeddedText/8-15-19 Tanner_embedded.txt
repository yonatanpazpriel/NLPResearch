I asking that CA's ethic studies curriculum includes the Jewish experience (which is missing as of now) yet other maligned groups like Islam are included. This is remarkable that anti Semitism and the history of anti Semitism, Nazism, is left out when there is even an increase in attacks on Jews in the last few years. Whoever organized this has a bias that needs to be addressed.
