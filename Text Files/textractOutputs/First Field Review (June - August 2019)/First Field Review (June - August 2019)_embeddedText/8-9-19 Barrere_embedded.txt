From: Kirsten Barrere Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:33 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
This country is currently swimming in an atmosphere of hate and white nationalism with deadly consequences for any American. I urge you to do nothing which will further inflame our country, or give rise to other types of hate, and blind prejudice.
I am concerned about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination. When the California Department of Education changes the Ethnic Studies Curriculum it must be certain that the re-write will not demonize any groups. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual. Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Thank you.
Kirsten Barrere Oakland, CA a voter
