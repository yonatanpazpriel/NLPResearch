Page 234: Racism in America was mandated in laws and racial policies were implemented by both the American government and citizens. Racial differences are still affecting individuals' behavior in the United States. In Israel, however, the conflict with Palestinians is not a racial or a religious matter but rather political. Racism has never been and never will be a mandated behavior or policy and it is against the law to discriminate due to any reason including race. Relating American racial issues with Israeli Palestinian conflict is a distortion of facts and promotes hate against both Israel and Jews. Besides, there are many races among Jews and Arabs alike and if you walk down the streets of Israel, you can see all skin colors and extreme genetic differences. Did you know there are Arab Jews, too?!...Jews who have lived in many Middle Eastern countries until the establishment of Israel in 1948.

Page 237: When identifying Arab countries in the Middle Eastern, it is suggested that Israel is defined as: Israel-Palestine. Sadly, this name is another historic distortion. This is why: When the Roman Empire conquered the land of Israel, back then, it was called the Kingdom of Israel/Judea, they wanted to cut the ties Jews had to that land and they exiled them. Then, they renamed the Kingdom and called it Palestine. Many Jews stayed in the land and all inhabitants were called Palestinians, regardless of their faith. The Arabs and Islam did not exist yet. The Romans lost hold on the area, then came the Byzantines, the Khalifates, the Crusaders, the Mamelukes, the Ottomans and the British. The name Palestine remained the name of the area until the British handed it over back to the Jews in 1948 with the agreement of the United Nations. The Jews decided to give the land its ancient name of Israel. Before this final establishment of Modern Israel, the United Nations offered to divide the land between Arabs and Jews. The Jews agreed reluctantly for the sake of peace, but the Arabs refused to share the land. To this day, they want all Jews to be expelled from the only Jewish state there is, while there are 22 other Arab countries.

Page 242 (starting in line 5158): The 1948 war broke out as soon as the Jews who had lived there declared Independence soon after being given permission by the UK and the United Nations to make a Jewish country there. All residents, Jews and Arabs were called Palestinians, since they all lived there. When the Jews accepted the partition plan, and the Arabs did not, the Arabs attacked the Jews. A possible short movie that can give a balanced view on the topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wo2TLlMhiw
Page 264-268: Undoubtedly, music is a wonderful way to express ideas, teach and promote change and understanding among people and countries. However, Shadia Mansour, who is a very talented artist, might instigate violence, racism and hate in her songs, please watch one of her songs, to the end, it's followed with translation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwSjIk63rhg. Very clearly she describes terrorists in Gaza as martyrs and Israeli as vicious Zionists, some of her lyrics: "I will suck your brain out and pour them in my cup...bang, bang, bang,.....Zionism shall be defeated....etc." Do we promote co-existence by legitimizing a singer whose aim is to destroy the only democracy in the Middle East? By delegitimizing Israeli military and falsely portraying it as hostile and hateful towards children do we promote peace or do we destroy decades of political and social attempts to create closeness between Arabs and Jews in the region? Aren't there Muslim and Arab artists who can be better agents to the Arab world? She describes Israel as a colony and does not respect the right of the Jewish people for a land, while she expects the world to accept her demand for the same exact right.

A serious research online in reliable sources can teach more on how Palestine is actually an ancient Greek/Roman name that was given to the land of Israel much before the current Arab - Palestinians adopted it. The name Palestine remained the name of the region until the Jews were given the legal permission to build in their forefathers' land they were expelled from nearly 2000 years ago by the Romans.
During WW2, when 6 million Jews were being slaughtered in the Nazi extermination camps all over Europe, no country accepted the Jewish refugees, that was when the world realized Jews needed one land of their own. Today, Jews finally have one small country to flee to (size of New Jersey), while there are 22 Arab countries. Is this fact being taught alongside with the program about the Arab-Israeli conflict? Is the long and painful process of returning to their forefathers' land and recreating a land of their own after 2000 years of living in foreign lands being taught as part of the current Arab -Israeli conflict?
Is there any word about The Partition Plan the United Nations suggested to both the Jews and the Arabs and that the Arabs kept opposing to before the 1948 War?
Are there any lessons about the Jews who fled Arab countries such as: Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Morocco, Syria, Jordan, Algeria, Tunis, Libya....in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950's? Lost their homes, land, money and property?
Is there any lesson about the horrific attacks Arabs committed against Jews in Palestine in the late 1800's and during the 1900's which led to the formation of the Jewish Defense forces (Etzel, Lechi, Hagana, Hashomer Hatzaeer) since the Ottomans (Turks) and then the British forces did not protect them??....
While Israel offered many Arabs to remain in Israel in 1948, many fled to neighboring countries or to the West Bank and Gaza. Is this mentioned anywhere in the program?...
Is there any mentioning of the many lands Israel gave up Gaza, much of the West Bank to the Palestinians in 2004 and over the past two decades?

Is there a mentioning of the fact that Hamas, a terrorist organizations, uses children, women, old people, hospitals, schools and so on as human shield and as ammunition storage or simply to launch rockets into Israeli homes?.... Is it mentioned that Hamas does not respect human rights as most democratic countries do?
Israel will make peace with the Arabs living in Gaza and the West Bank, if only they wanted. The problem is they do not accept co - existence with the Jews and therefore, peace is not an option.

Dear California Education Associates and Supervisors,
My name is Rachel Nissim and I am a resident of California and a citizen of the United States. I am a teacher in the DLIFLC in Monterey and, with your permission, I find it my responsibility to share with you some of my concerns here.
I heard about this initiative to teach in public schools a program about the Middle East and I am truly thankful for this initiative.
While it is highly important to teach students about all nations and people of the world and their history, it is also important to teach the facts carefully and responsibly.
As a teacher who often is engaged in this topic in class, I read the suggested plan carefully and have some questions to you.
In addition to the form I filled out as required, I have written some of my remarks and questions to you:
A serious research online and in reliable sources teaches us that the word: Palestine has nothing to do with the Arab people or Arabic. It is actually an ancient Greek/Roman name that was given to the land of Israel much before the current

Arab - Palestinians adopted it. The name Palestine remained the name of the region until the Jews were given the legal permission to build in their forefathers' land they were expelled from nearly 2000 years ago by the Romans. Is this fact mentioned anywhere in the curriculum?
During WW2, when 6 million Jews were being slaughtered in the Nazi extermination camps all over Europe, no country accepted the Jewish refugees, that was when the world realized Jews needed one land of their own. Today, Jews finally have one small country to flee to (size of New Jersey), while there are 22 Arab countries. Is this fact being taught alongside with the the program about the Arab-Israeli conflict which is part of this new program?
Is the long and painful process of the returning of the Jews to their forefathers land (now called Israel again) and recreating a land of their own after 2000 years of living in foreign lands being taught as part of the current Arab -Israeli conflict?
Is there any hint about '"The Partition Plan" the United Nations suggested to both the Jews and the Arabs and that the Arabs kept opposing to before the 1948 war?.....
Are there any lessons about the The Jewish Exodus from Arab Countries, when Jews who fled Arab countries such as: Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Morocco, Syria, Jordan, Algeria, Tunis, Libya....in the 1930's, 1940's and 1950s?....Lost their homes, land, money and property to the expelling Arab countries?
Is there any lesson about the horrific attacks Arabs committed against Jews in Palestine in the late 1800's and during the 1900's which led to the formation of the Jewish Defense forces (Etzel, Lechi, Hagana, Hashomer Hatzaeer) since the Ottomans (Turks) and then the British forces did not protect them??....and to more violence in the region?

Is there any mentioning that Hamas does not respect human rights in Gaza and that Gazens actually prefer Israel to govern in Gaza but they are afraid to say that?....
Israel will make peace with the Arabs living in Gaza and the west bank if only they wanted. The problem is they do not accept co - existence with the Jews and therefore, peace is not an option.
I am attaching here the form that is required by your department and the suggested lesson plan for your review and will be happy to hear back from you.
Thank you so much for your time, Rachel Nissim
