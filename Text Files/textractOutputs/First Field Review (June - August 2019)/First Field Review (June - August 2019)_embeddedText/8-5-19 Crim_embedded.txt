The 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum isn't an educational proposition, it is drivel. While some of the guiding principles outlined in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines seem reasonable the underlying theme is that some folks self-identify as victims and rather than constructively participating in civilization, they want to tear it down. The supporters of this "curriculum" want to turn the game board over because they feel somehow wronged. Having read through the guidelines, chapters 1 � 4 and the appendices, I am certain this "curriculum" is harmful as it embraces, celebrates and exalts a self-defined sense of victim-hood in every tiny little fragmented social and anti-social "ethnic" group. This supports the "balkanization" of society. It plays into the hands of dictators who will claim that only they can reign in the disparate mobs that will result from teaching this type of hate-inspired "curriculum". Your "curriculum" is not an intellectual product. Rather it is a rant and a shout to the mob, reliant upon inherently biased and self-reinforcing ethnist-created definitions that ignore the totality of the 5000-years of recorded human civilization's history and the fact that as humans we have all suffered at the hands of others over time. That as humans, as members of the human "race", we will only improve our circumstances by understanding that there is only one "race", the human "race" and that we have to work together, find common understanding, build common institutions and create agreement as opposed to fragmentation. This "curriculum" is incredibly myopic, relying upon a current, localized, misanthropic observational and opinion-based illogic intended to appeal to a mob with perceived grievances. The "curriculum" is a sure path to failure for all and thus failure for the individual. Do not implement this "curriculum".
