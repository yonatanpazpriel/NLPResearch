From: Bill and Pat Crawford Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 12:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Proposed Ethinic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern: Your Microsoft word form does not work. I was unable to enter my comments on it. Doesn't speak well to encouraging comments on this curriculum.
We strongly disagree with this politically motivated proposal for our public schools. This does not encourage students how to think; rather it tells them what to think.
What are we to make of a curriculum that includes capitalism, the economic system of a free country as an evil with white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy (for Pete's sake!) and "other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society."
Anyone who approves of this "Orwellian" speak, should be singled out as abusive to children.
