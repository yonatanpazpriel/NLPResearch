To the committee for a proposed California "Ethnic Studies" curriculum:
I am a product of California public schooling (kindergarten through University.)
I am now an parent of California public middle-schooler, a California public high-schooler, and a California public university student.
I object to the introduction of an `Ethnic Studies' component to the California curriculum.
Let our public schools strengthen their core purpose - to give students a solid foundation in the basic academic subjects and prepare them for college and/or career. Can we truly say we have come even close to achieving these core purposes??
The `Ethnic Studies' curriculum being proposed sounds decidedly activist! and as such is totally out of keeping with the charge of public schools to be a neutral, non-religious, non-partisan environment. Let families impart their social activism priorities to their children, if they so choose, just as they do with their their religions and cultures.
School is not the place for these things.
"Ethnic Studies" may have a place in University, where the open study and comparison of various thought forms and their implications is, in fact, one of the core purposes. But it is out of place and completely inappropriate in the mandatory environment of primary, middle and high school - where our good teachers are endeavoring to teach kids you are limited only by your skills, knowledge and desire to succeed.
(And it hardly needs mentioning that the proposed course topics (as I have read about them in the media) are highly likely to agitate disputes and alienate students from different groups - again, completely contrary to the purposes of public exhaustion.)
No to "Ethnic Studies" in public elementary, middle and high schools.
