This is a horrible. It is nothing but a ridiculous attempt to breed hate and division. It is a socialistic point of view that does not celebrate the special beautiful things in all people and races. I do NOT support this being taught to my children. I think your focus should be on better education which has been getting nothing but worse in our State, under these types of changes.
