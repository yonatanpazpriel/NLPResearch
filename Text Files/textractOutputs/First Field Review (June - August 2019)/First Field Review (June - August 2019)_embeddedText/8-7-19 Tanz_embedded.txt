Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the middle east and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. I request removal of comments about BDS and other any-Israel bias. I would urge the state to study the history of Israel and history of the so call Palestinians, who were always citizens of the country of Jordan. A country that participated and attacked the country of Israel three times and had lost three times. You might also look at the views of the Koran that state that no Muslim will be rolled by infidels (all who do not adhere to the religion of Islam).
