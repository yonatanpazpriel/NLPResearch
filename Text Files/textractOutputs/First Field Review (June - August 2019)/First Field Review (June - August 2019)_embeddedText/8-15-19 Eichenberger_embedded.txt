Page 2, lines 30-37. This explanation of BDS offers no perspective on Palestinian leaders goal to end Israel's existence. The description fails to note how BDS interferes with any genuine peace efforts. BDS is inherently antiJewish and California education should not endorse this effort. Page 234, lines 4956, 4957, 4958: These lines exemplify how the lesson plans are entirely one-sided. They support only Palestinian claims with presenting Israel's existential issues. There is no mention of Palestinian terrorists who infiltrate Israel and kill innocent citizens. There is no mention of the terrorist group Hamas that controls Palestinian territories. This is wildly biased. There are no lessons explaining concerns of the minority group...Jews who are a tiny fraction of the population in the area. Page 237, line 5030: How is it that the sovereign nation of Israel is named here as a hyphenate: Israel-Palestine? This is at best inaccurate and at worst, an attempt to mislead California students for a pro-Palestine agenda.

Page 242, lines 5158, 5159, 5160, 5161: These lines present a one-sided description of the 1948 Israel War of Independence. There is nothing about the Jews massacred by Arabs, the simultaneous attack by several Arab countries. While some Palestinians were expelled from the new state, others were asked to remain but followed the Arab attackers who urged them to leave. Why is this "history" so skewed in this lesson? The proposed curriculum does not include any lessons about the Jewish community in California or the U.S. It doesn't go into the rise of antisemitism and general lack of knowledge by many Americans about Jewish history in the U.S. or in Israel, the discrimination against Jews particularly in the 20th century or the contributions of Jewish Americans to medicine, the arts or society. Jews are also an ethnicity in this country. Why are American Jews not a part of this curriculum?
