From: Sam Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Class?
I am a retired social studies teacher, with forty years of teaching experience, ranging from elementary to the post graduate level at UC Berkeley. It is with alarm and disbelief I read of this proposed curriculum. Please review current text books and supplementary materials used by educators who are on the frontlines. If there is room for another required class, let it be on how to properly use loans, invest for the future, understand taxation and how an individual's decision making can profoundly a young persons life. There is no real need for a politically motivated requirement that really does not truly benefit the student's quest to be a productive citizen. The fact that the proposal is politically biased is underlined by the anti-Israeli bent of the curriculum, as there is no mention of the equally pressing problems of ethnic Kurds, Yemenis, Copts, Syrians, Sudanese. Perhaps another group in this area of the world has not been listed- these groups come to mind. Where is the indignation and address? If examined, it appears one group is addressed, and it smacks of the ancient curse of anti-Semitism. If you push this class, please include these facts: the only country in the Middle East where Arabs have the right to vote, the only nation to evacuate black people to safety (Ethiopians), the nation with some of the best technology in the world, the unwavering ally of the United States, is the tiny nation of Israel.
