Public Input Template�2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
Matthew Sander, parent I read the entirety of Chapter 1, and it is clear this is an unadulterated attempt at entrenching the practice of identity politics within our young adults, falsely claiming that "Ethnic Studies" is there to broaden one's perspectives on our various citizens' cultures. Instead, by referencing literature written by and basing curriculum created by known socialists and communists (re: Wheeler and Boggs), it is clear this is focused on inculcating solid leftist philosophy on CA student bodies. I'll be okay if CA wants to discuss the "oppressive nature" of capitalism if it turns around and also notes that it is the single greatest form of economics to bring individuals out of poverty: just ask the 450 million Chinese who moved into the middle class from 2000 to 2015 after their capitalist market reforms started taking effect by the mid-1980's (https://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-middle-class-is-exploding-
2016-8).
The individual is critical to the great American "experiment" of liberty and freedom, yet the focus of these "Ethnic Studies" is about the group, promoting identity politics that is in itself the most racist ideology we see today. Every Native American and black person does not have the same experience, but you speak of the "experiences of Native People/s and people of color," as though they do. This is the basis of your teaching philosophy: "these" non-white people are different and their "shared" experiences must be understood. And yet, a poor white child raised in urban Philadelphia will have a more similar upbringing to a poor Mexican-American in Los Angeles than he will with a middle-class white child raised in Springfield, Illinois. This "collective" experience of sub-groups is one of the bases for standard socialist thought and leads to groupthink. And groupthink erodes individual creativity and personal accountability � vital tenets of a modern civilized society.
Throw in the decision to rewrite the word "history" throughout this chapter, the focus on "encouraging students . . . to become

agents of change, [and] social justice organizers" (versus a focus on stimulating debate and learning), and the idea that identity based on race is so important vs. the identity as an American or simply as an individual � and you have a curriculum offering that actually sows more division than unity among our young citizenry.
Stick with the "stand alone" options for Ethnic Studies, like my college class on "Female African-American Writers of the 20th Century." I learned more about the African American female experience from Toni Morrison and Zora Neal Hurston in a class of 15 persons (I was one of two young men) � and not once did someone ask me how I felt about the literature as a "white man of privilege" or how the story resonated with one of my classmates as a "woman of color." It was honest, open, and everyone was an individual � not a representative of a certain category.
