I am respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. With the rising hatred and antisemitism in our society, the exclusion of the jewish people from this curriculum will increase bias and ignorance towards them. A one-sided view of problems never leads to a resolution of conflict, on the contrary it perpetuates the division.

References: pages 234, 237 and 242, 256 and 264-269 of the sample curriculum lessons offers no critical perspective to the BDS movement, does not touch on the indoctrination of hatred towards Israel and Jews since a young age, uses un clear language that compares Israel's acts against terrorists to acts of murder. The curriculum's introduction, despite its goal to develop appreciation to diversity and inclusion, by offering a one-sided vision and by excluding the jewish community, will promote the extermination of the jews, an ethnic minority. I do not want my children to grow up in an environment of hatred. The BDS movement does little to close the division or prevent another holocaust to occur.
