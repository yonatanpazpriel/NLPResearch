The members of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum advisory committee should be commended for taking on a difficult task and for their work on producing a thoughtful draft. All curriculum, regardless of the subject, requires revision and refinement because education is dynamic and always a work-inprogress. The fact that there is disagreement and criticism is a healthy sign that the democratic process is at work and that people are engaged.
The charge that the model curriculum is biased seems odd since ethnic studies is a relatively recent attempt to bring some balance to the longstanding bias in American education, at all levels, that has privileged European Americans and ignored the experiences and contributions of many peoples, especially indigenous and communities of color, who have been and continue to be such an integral part of U.S. society.

Ethnic studies is important for all Americans and very much needed in the K-12 schools because it provides a fuller understanding of who we are as a nation. A more diverse and honest accounting of our past and present is necessary for a collective envisioning of a future in which there is liberty and justice for all.
