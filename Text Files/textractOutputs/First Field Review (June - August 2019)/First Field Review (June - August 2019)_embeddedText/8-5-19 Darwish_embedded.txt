From: sue darwish Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 8:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic California curriculum
Dear Sir: I disagree with the ethnic studies you have proposed for California schools because I have two grandchildren going to go to those schools and do not want them subjected to these views. I was born in a country that discriminated and hated Jews and don't want the same to happen in California. Mrs. Darwish
