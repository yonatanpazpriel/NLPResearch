Committee Members,
I am extremely disappointed with the proposed curriculum. As a life long academic and educator, I believe curriculum must be based on facts, not on the political mood of the moment nor social fad. Briefly, I take exception to:
Capitalism being incorrectly described as a "form of power and oppression." Were you unable to locate an economist, who could provide the actual definition?
Individuals, such as Mumia Abu-Jamal (a convicted murderer) and similar criminals being offered up as "potentially significant figures."
Omitting the Jewish people in the discussion of historically oppressed groups. For the record - I am not Jewish.
California once had a great reputation in education. This Is no longer the case and the proposed curriculum is not worthy of our students. Please get a new group of curriculum developers, experts in their fields and without political agendas. It is worth a complete rewrite to provide a factual curriculum.
