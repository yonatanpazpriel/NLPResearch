Reg: Public Input Template�2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft.
It's my understanding that the State of California is currently reviewing a model Ethnic Studies curriculum which promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. Disturbingly, this agenda was inserted into an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities. Despite it's stated purpose, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism.
A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
As a former educator, I appeal to you to not promote Anti-Israel Hate in California Public Schools. What are we doing? No parent should allow these inferences and omissions and political propaganda to be presented to their children. Please address these concerns below quickly and thank you in advance for probing this important matter further.
Thank you very much for your consideration.

Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Specific pages include page 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269. BDS promotes hate and division. Inclusion is of utmost importance. Please add lessons about American Jewish people as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union (Page 234).
Please remove the false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (Page 234). Please do not encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256,264-269)
The introduction of the curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jewish people only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing and troubling.
Page 242 frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 237 is unclear language and implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country.
