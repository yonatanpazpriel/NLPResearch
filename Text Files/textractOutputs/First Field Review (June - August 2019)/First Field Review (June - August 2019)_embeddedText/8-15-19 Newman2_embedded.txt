From: AL KATZ- Help Elders Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:53 PM To: SBE Subject: REJECTION OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM
California State Board of Education Sacramento, California
Dear California State Board of Education:
The draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should be rejected outright on the basis of its severe anti-Semitic and anti-Israel biases, neither of which should ever be given the imprimatur of governmental sanction to impressionable young students.
It is my understanding that the Curriculum includes, inter alia:
1. No course outlines on Jewish Americans, although it contains course outlines on Arab Americans; 2. barely any mention of anti-Semitism; 3. promotion of the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement and its supporters; 4. anti-Semitic stereotypes, such as Jewish control of the world press; and 5. labeling of Israel as an oppressor and as a colonist nation.
This Curriculum has attained national notoriety due to the above and it has no place in California's schools.
