Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population. I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.

I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students. As a person of Jewish heritage, I am grateful that I've had the opportunity to revise the highlybiased, ignorant, and anti-Arab view points I was raised with. Learning about Arabs and Arab Americans has enriched my experience as an American and as a Jew. Including Arab American perspectives and contributions to society is vital to Ethnic Studies, and to exclude it does a tremendous disservice to all students of this discipline, to Arab Americans, as well as to the general public. Including the experience of Arab Americans in Ethnic Studies may trigger fear on the part of Jewish people who have not yet had the opportunity to learn from the Arab and Arab American experience, but it is certainly NOT not anti-semitic.
