Hello,
I have read your sample curriculum for Ethnics Studies and I am strongly opposed to it.
Aside from the fact that it ignores Jewish Americans as an ethnics group (which is the subject to increasing attacks), it shows a clear bias against Jews and the State of Israel.
Can you explain why a discussion of the Arab ethnic group involves topics such as the Direct Action front for Palestine, the BDS (voted against in Congress) and a study of the borders of Palestine and Mexico? What does Ilhan Omar have to do with the American Arab ethnic group?
It seems that the authors of this curriculum have a broader agenda: education of a new generation towards antisemitism and resentment of the state of Israel.
I urge you to adopt a curriculum that educates our youth for respect of ALL ethnic groups, including the Jewish community in an unbiased and balanced way.
Best Regards,
