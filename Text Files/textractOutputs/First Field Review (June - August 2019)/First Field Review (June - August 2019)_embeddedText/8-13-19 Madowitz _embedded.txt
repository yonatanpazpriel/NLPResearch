While I applaud the inclusion of Ethnic Studies to broaden students
appreciation 6f diversity and promote inclusion I respectfutty betieve the
current curriculum does not promote decreasing and hopefully eradicating racism, hate and bigotry. Specifically, while I think it is appropriate to include drscussio n of the BDS movement, I don't believe that emphasizing the point of view of Direct Action for Palestine, without offering the perspective of opinions that oppose fhis movement is neither fair nor likely to improve understanding and perspective. Furthermore much as I disagree with the US policy on our southern border, equating Israel's efforts fo sfop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent civilians to that of the United States policies on the border with Mexico is I believe a distortion and unfair. Finally as the son of Holocaust survivors I am deeply offended that Jews are not offered or included in those that have suffered major bigotry. lt is one thing to be discriminated against and another to have millions of your people slaughtered. I applaud what you are trying to achieve believe if needs major revision fo be successfu I and to help eradicate bias and hatred.
Sincerely,
