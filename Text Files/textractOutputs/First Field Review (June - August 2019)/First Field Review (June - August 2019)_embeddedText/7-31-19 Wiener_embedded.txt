I writing to comment on the assertion that the curriculum for ethnic studies states that capitalism is racist.
I have not had time to review the entire guideline, but I think it would be misleading that capitalism is racist.
An economic system cannot be racist, but people who advocate a system can be. Also, racist individuals and practices can affect the experience that people have in an economic system. That's different from saying that the system is racist.
It is true that racism past and present has made it more difficult for people of certain races to benefit from capitalism. The solution to that is not to abandon capitalism. To say that capitalism is racist is deceptive.
I think this needs to be corrected.
