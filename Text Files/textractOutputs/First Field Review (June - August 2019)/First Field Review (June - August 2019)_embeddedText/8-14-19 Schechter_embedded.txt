Page 1 omits a definition of anti-Semitism
Page 2 includes a definition for BDS
Page 242 (lines 5157-61) uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel Pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land. In general, I am concerned that the draft curriculum according to the California Legislative Jewish Caucus:
1. Neglects the American Jewish experience 2. Omits anti-Semitism as a form of bias and hatred 3. Does not sufficiently reflect Jewish ethnic and cultural identity 4. Unfairly calls Israel out for condemnation

I want to encourage the California Department of Education to add lessons about the history of American Jews as an ethnic group. This curriculum will impact my children and thousands of children in the community. May it be in as positive and accurate way as possible. Thank you.
