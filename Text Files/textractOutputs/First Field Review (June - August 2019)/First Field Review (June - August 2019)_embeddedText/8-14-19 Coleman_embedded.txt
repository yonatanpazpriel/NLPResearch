Hello, I understand that the pro bds movement is trying to establish a curriculum in california public schools that would teach anti semitism and anti israel propoganda.
I am urging the cde to not let the pro bds movement influence the curriculum in the great and noble state of california.
We already have way too much hate in our country and we dont need anymore.
The pro bds movement is not a pro palestinian organization as it clAims to be. There was a factory in israel that was employing Palestinians and israelis and the Palestinians were making higher wages than people in Gaza. Because of the efforts of the pro bds movement, this fActory was shut down and the Palestinians lost their good paying jobs. I ask you, how is this pro palestinian!?
If you want to keep the u.s. safe from terror, then it is in everybody's best interest to support israel as it is on the frontlines of fighting terrorism. Without israel, the whole middle east would fall apart.
Furthermore, this kind of curriculum would teach a whole generation to hate jews and israelis. And it would probably lead to more shootings like the ones at the synagogues in Pittsburgh and poway california. We dont need more extremism and we dont need extremism and hate being taught in our schools.
Israel is a country in which jews and Muslims and Christian's work alongside each other. Israel is by no means a country of apartheid.
The pro bds movement want to present li da ardour as a role model. She is not a role model. She is a hater and an extremist.
I beg you to not let the pro bds movement influence our children's education.
Let's be responsible and reasonable. Thank you, Rachel Coleman
