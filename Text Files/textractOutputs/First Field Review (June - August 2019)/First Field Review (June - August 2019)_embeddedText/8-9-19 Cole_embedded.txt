From: Adam Cole Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 10:11 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The draft ethnic studies curriculum must be amended
For two reasons:
1. It is one-sided and coercive. Students should never be urged to take one position over another. Rather, they should be given arguments for and against and allowed to decide for themselves.
For example, the treatment of the BDS movement as socially progressive and worthy of support should be explicitly paired with the fact that it denies the right of Jewish self-determination (i.e., says Palestinians have a right of self-determination but Jews don't). Students must be encouraged to understand both sides of BDS and it must be made clear they are free to decide whether BDS is a force for good or a denial of one minority's right of self-determination.
2. The curriculum fails to include Jews as a discriminated-against minority. With anti-Semitic incidents escalating exponentially, it should be clear as a bell that Jews also are victims and in danger. The curriculum must make that clear.
The department of education must change the curriculum to address these critical issues.
