Pages 2,234,237,242,256,264-269. In page 234 I do not agree with the statement that teachers should encourage and highlight the BDS movement, and not offer criticism. Also on the same page I do not believe that is right to compare Israel's wall to stop terrorists from blowing themselves up in schools, shopping centers, and squares to the United States and Mexico border. On page 237 there is some unclear language that suggests that Israel-Palestine is an Arab country which it is not. Also in page 242 it only states the Palestinian narrative and doesn't allow students to see both sides of the narrative. The last problem in this draft is pages 256,264-269 is that teachers should recite a bigoted poem against the Jewish State without offering positive content about Israel or critisicim of the failed Palestinian state.
