Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I very much support the expansion of Ethnic Studies classes in California. However, I'm concerned that the recommended curriculum would not include anti-Semitism as a topic when discussing bigotry, hate groups, and hate crimes. Half of the hate crimes based on religious bigotry are anti-Semitic in nature. As a Jewish person, a native Californian, and a school mental health counselor in East Oakland, I urge you to adopt the recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter and shine a light on all forms of bigotry and hatred so that our young people can take action to rise above them together.
Sincerely,
Shana Barchas
