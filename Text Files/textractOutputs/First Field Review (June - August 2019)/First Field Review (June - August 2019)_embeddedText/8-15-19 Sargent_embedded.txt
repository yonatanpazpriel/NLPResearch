My objections go far beyond specific pages or citations. This entire curriculum reads as an extreme political indoctrination agenda, presented under cover of an ethnic studies program, using the school system as a factory for churning out future one-party voters. This is outright brainwashing of our children into promoting a far-left-wing political agenda and has no place in schools.

Your definition of capitalism is very biased pushing a left-wing agenda. By defining capitalism as a "form of power and oppression", it fails to see the value that capitalism brings to society. The United States was founded on the principles of freedom, and people from all over the world flock to the US, my parents included, for the opportunity for a better life founded on capitalist principles.
Characteristics central to capitalism also include the notion of private property, capital accumulation, and the voluntary exchange of goods and services leveraging a price system found in competitive markets. This push to brainwash our children moving us from the ideals our country was built upon, and ideals for which so many of us have worked hard to achieve, is absolutely frightening.

Page 2, rows 42 � 47: Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified.

This curriculum is biased against Israel and Jews. The California Legislative Jewish Caucus said it best and I agree with and support their position. To put on record my concerns in this regard, I quote their position:
"Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government -- and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination -- the ESMC effectively erases the American Jewish experience. Indeed, notwithstanding widespread agreement that Judaism is a form of identity that is broader than religion, and the inclusion of religion in sample courses for African American, Native American, Latin American, and Arab American Studies, Jews are essentially excluded from the ESMC. . . .

While the ESMC specifies the importance of studying hate crimes, white supremacy, bias, prejudice, and discrimination, and specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of antisemitism. . . .

In the few instances where the ESMC acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics that inappropriately delve into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with strong bias and little nuance and asserts that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture," a classic antisemitic trope about Jewish control of the media." Page 234, row 4957 It is troubling that California is promoting a campaign to "boycott, divest from and place sanctions on Israel" for its treatment of Palestinians. The issue is a complex one and this is promoting one side's view on the issue. This is an abuse of your captive child audience to brainwash kids, pushing propaganda, and create left-wing protest soldiers. Political indoctrination is not an American value and has no place in our schools or this country.

It is flabbergasting that California schools would teach our children that our country deserved what happened in the 9/11 as a result of "imperialism." It is not acceptable to teach children that murder and destruction is OK, if justified.
Given the whole tone of this document, this is brainwashing children to think that all of the injustices in the world demand action, and this section condones violence and terrorism as a means to that. That's absolutely terrifying that you are creating the mindset for this yet will point to gun laws as the problem with violence in this county. THIS propaganda is as much to blame, if not more, than the access to weapons to carry out the ideals brainwashed into people's heads.

Page 233, row 4937 - 4942 "...students will be exposed to how Arab Americans...have suffered from being perceived as a domestic enemy in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. These negative sentiments toward Arab Americans stem primarily from ignorance, but they also reflect a troubled relationship between the US and the Arab world as a result of US imperialism."

This curriculum is pushing divisive bigotry of the political left, in this case demonizing whites throughout as the evil lords to be blamed for all of the ills of the world. Bigotry is wrong, regardless of political affiliation and schools should not be stoking racism and anger against people who look different from us, regardless of color, including against whites.

To quote Martin Luther King, Jr. "I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character"

We should be moving in a direction where skin color is just a physical feature, and not one that divides us into fractions. The divisiveness and tone of this document is moving our country in the wrong direction and I implore you to attempt to use this curriculum to move us in the direction beseeched by the wise MLK.
