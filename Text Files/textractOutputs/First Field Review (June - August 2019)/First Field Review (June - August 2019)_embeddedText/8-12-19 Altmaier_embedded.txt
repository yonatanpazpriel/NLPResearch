I think this chapter misses the entire point of education: to enable our children to perform well in the world, perform well at their future jobs, in their family and community lives. The suggestion we should teach children to understand historical dehumanization and relate that to present achievement of the children is disrespectful to minorities and is a preposterous concept. All children can learn. Minority children can learn. To teach our children that they have an achievement gap due to past wrongs, is ridiculous. From the start, it suggests a child of color is not expected to do well. Such a teaching and approach is morally and ethically wrong.

Ethnic studies at the elementary school level has no place. Our children need to be taught to read and write and that they can achieve greatness by individual effort and focus.

To teach a child that wrongs to their ancestors means this child faces such struggles or needs to support a resistance movement or racially heal, is totally wrong and harming our children.

Every proposed course item in this chapter is wrong legally and morally to teach our children. This entire chapter is what is called a "victim mode" style. It presumes a person is suffering constantly due to others and can do nothing for themselves. We cannot and most not teach victim mode of thinking. We must teach our children to read, write, be great at math, and know they can achieve greatness by working hard and helping others to succeed. I totally oppose teaching any of the lessons in this chapter. They are horribly disfiguring to our children.

The writer of this chapter should be ashamed for creating such nonsense and an absurd manner of thinking. Where is the future founder of Google in these lessons? Nowhere to be found. Instead we find the child is expected to waste their education hours with grievances and complaints and expect to be oppressed. My overall sense is the person who wrote this curriculum is so full of hate and anger they cannot see straight. Every aspect of this curriculum has no place in our education system from K to 12. I totally oppose it.
