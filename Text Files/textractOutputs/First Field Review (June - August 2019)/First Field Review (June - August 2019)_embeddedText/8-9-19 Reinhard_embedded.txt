I am writing in full agreement and support of the critical objections to the curriculum made by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus in their letter dated July 29, 2019 https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_LNvdDqJa0Aougc9deePJ-XyB7JurNz/view Indeed it is unconscionable only four months after the horrific events of the shootings at the Poway synagogue and less than a year after the mass shooting of congregants in Pennsylvania � just as examples - that the state of California would consider this document even in draft form instead of returning it for being unacceptable and unfit for public comment. Denialism and subtle propaganda such as the draft reflects are in league with other persuasions that have supported a climate of hatred in our society. The draft is certainly out of touch with the general principles set out for the curriculum guidelines. As regards particulars of Israeli/Palestinian relations � if that is a subject for inclusion at all � the core people from both groups seek peace, inclusiveness and mutual respect, regard and honor for the traditions and dignity of all. The state would be disgracing the intentions of those good efforts if it taught a curriculum promoting the false pictures the draft contains now. [I live in Sen Scott Weiner's district]
