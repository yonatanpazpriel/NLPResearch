Dear members of the department. I am really sorry to find the curriculum rather heavy on self pity and devoid of factual information regarding the general American experience. Almost every wave of new immigrants suffered discrimination, and struggled for success and acceptance. While acknowledgeing those struggling groupd we will do them much greater service by providing knowledge of success of Catolics Italian Armenian , early Arab immigrants,Jews, poles , Italian and other immigrants. Who were stereotyped too, and are now main stream. Stereotyping white Americans as bad and discriminatory by nature is first not true and secondly would not contribute to true improvement to the lot of struggling groups. Respectfully. Ze'ev Zalk
