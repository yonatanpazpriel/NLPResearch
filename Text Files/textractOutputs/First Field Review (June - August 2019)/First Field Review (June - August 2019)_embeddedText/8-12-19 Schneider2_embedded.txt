From: Morgan Blum Schneider Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Anita Friedman Subject: Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education,
On behalf of the Jewish Family and Children's Services Holocaust Center, we appreciate the work of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee (MCAC) in producing a multi-chapter CA 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) draft. We greatly value the opportunity to comment on this draft. The attached review provides recommendations aimed at ensuring accuracy, inclusion, and pedagogical rigor for California's students. Given that AB-331 would make a one-semester high school Ethnic Studies course a requirement for graduation in California, we believe it is all the more important to ensure that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is of the highest quality and adheres to California values, standards, and law.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with further information.
Regards,
Morgan
