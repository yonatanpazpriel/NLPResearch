From: Lara Hochstein Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 4:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerns about ethnic studies model curriculum
To Whom It May Concern,
As a parent and educator, I have very serious concerns about the ethnic studies model curriculum and urge the Board of Education to reject this proposal. While the intentions behind this curriculum may have been good, this specific proposal pushes a very clear political agenda, which is not appropriate for public schools. I read through the curriculum and agree with the LA times that it seems designed to "proselytize and inculcate more than to inform and open minds". Given the increasing polarization in our society, this is especially problematic; we should be encouraging students to entertain different opinions and think for themselves, not ramming a particular ideology down their throats.
I am also absolutely appalled by the blatant antisemitism in this curriculum. Encouraging students to study BDS without acknowledging that this is a controversial movement and mentioning "islamaphobia" as a problem but not "antisemitism" -- this is simply unacceptable and especially disconcerting in light of the rise of antisemitic incidents in the US and abroad.
If this curriculum is adopted and mandated in public schools across California, it will do a major disservice to our students and to our society at large.
Sincerely,
Lara Hochstein Redwood City, CA
