From: Joe Fryd Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 3:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti Israel hate in new curriculum
Please remove the anti-Israel bias from the new curriculum, which would promote BDS against Israel. Stop anti-Israel and anti Jewish bias. Jews are also an oppressed minority. That is not in the proposed curriculum. The offensive parts of the curriculum are on pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256 and 264-269. Please see that they are removed.
