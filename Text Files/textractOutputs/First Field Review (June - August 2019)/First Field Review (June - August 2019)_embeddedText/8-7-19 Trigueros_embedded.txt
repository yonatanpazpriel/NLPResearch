Hi very concerned of the intent of teaching curriculum that deals with the inaccurate teachings of capitalism being racist. That's very upsetting and I for one will let all my friends know. I didn't vote for this. THIS better not pass to our little ones. Very disturbing! ALL forms should be taught to our children and let them decide on their own. Socialism is terrible
