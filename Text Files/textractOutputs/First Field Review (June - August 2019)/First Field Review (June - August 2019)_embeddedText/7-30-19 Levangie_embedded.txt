From: Gigi Levangie c/o Foumberg and Co. Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 12:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject:
As a child of the public school system, and as the daughter of a public school educator (and granddaughter of one), and having put my own children through public school - I have to say, what you're doing is wrongheaded on so many levels. For example, you're encouraging kids to think that capitalism is evil - when actually, the Latin community is doing very well within the capitalistic system - check the statistics - more home ownership than ever before. Capitalism encourages us all to do our best, to rise above our circumstances - to make it in a sometimes harsh world. You're encouraging children to think of themselves not as strong and independent and able to think critically on any subject - you're encouraging them to think of themselves as victims, seeing obstacles wherever they turn.
This is bordering on child abuse - it certainly is inculcation.
The public school system is broken - our children are testing lower than every before; this certainly isn't helping. Stick to STEM, stick to math, stick to children being able to write an essay before they get to college.
I shake my head at what you, our teachers and educators have become. You're worse than Antifa - at least we can see that they're violent idiots, hurting the very people they profess to want to help. You are a virus. Our children will pay the price.
Cheers,
