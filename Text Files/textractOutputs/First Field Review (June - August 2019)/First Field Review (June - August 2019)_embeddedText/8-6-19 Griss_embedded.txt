The curriculum suggests that it will enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." It seems to suggest that only people of color should be considered � yet whites from various countries, including Irish, Jews and others are also part of ethnic groups that have been defined, vilified and targeted. In particular the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community and the decades long anti-Semitism and the Holocaust. Ignorance about the Jewish people and the bias they have faced is still a major problem in our society, and the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

Pg 234 -Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives.
Pg 234 -Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.

Pg 237 � Deliberate use of language to implies that "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country.

Pg 242 � Claim the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War and the "Nakba" as fact, with no alternative perspectives such as multiple Arab nations attacked Israel, that there was a continuous Jewish presence in Israel and that all Jews are not "colonists" I am very concerned by the curriculum's inclusion of the divisive BDS movement, which is inconsistent with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines to `create space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality or citizenship, to learn different perspectives.' " Pg 2 � Only entry in "B" is BDS � a rather long, incomplete/incorrect definition, ignoring the calls for eliminating Israel.
Pg 5 � Usefully defines Ethnicity which clearly could include the Jewish people, yet there is no mention of Israel or Jews in the Glossary

Pg7 � Genocide mentioned, yet no examples like Holocaust, Rwanda, etc. offered.

Pg 10 � Islamaphobia mentioned, but anti-semitism not mentioned at all. Antisemitism which certainly has had a bigger impact.
