From: Michael A. Mahony Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 7:04 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: PUBLIC COMMENT RESPONSE TO 'ETHNIC STUDEIS MODEL CURRICULUM Importance: High
This curriculum is a HUGE mistake for the following reasons:
� curriculum presents a serious problem of fairness to students � it's training students to become ideological activists and proponents of identity politics. � The curriculum is entirely wrongheaded when it comes to critical thinking � The curriculum lauds bilingual education, but it omits that this program--in which teachers
conducted class mostly in Spanish until seventh grade--failed in California and was disliked by much of the Latino community. � The curriculum perpetuates the myth that the Indians had the same values as present-day ecologists. In truth, Native Americans had a mixed approach to nature. The curriculum writers should have looked carefully at the scholarly evidence presented in Shepard Krech's 1999 book, "The Ecological Indian" � The curriculum describes subprime loans as an attack on home buyers with low incomes rather than a misguided attempt by the government to help such home buyers. Politicians--Republicans and Democrats--imposed lower underwriting standards on the home-loan industry. Republicans billed it as a way to expand the middle class, while Democrats crowed that it would aid the poor. � Teachers are encouraged to cite the biographies of "potentially significant figures" such as Angela Davis, Frantz Fanon and Bobby Seale. Convicted cop-killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur are also on the list. Students are taught that the life of George Jackson matters "now more than ever." Jackson, while in prison, became "a revolutionary warrior for Black liberation and prison reform." The Latino section's people of significance include Puerto Rican nationalists Oscar L�pez Rivera, a member of a paramilitary group that carried out more than 130 bomb attacks, and Lolita Lebr�n, who was convicted of attempted murder in a group assault that wounded five congressmen. � economics. Capitalism is described as a "form of power and oppression," alongside "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy" and "ableism." Capitalism and capitalists appear as villains several times in the document � It is difficult to comprehend the depth and breadth of the ideological bias and misrepresentations without reading the whole curriculum--something few will want to do
