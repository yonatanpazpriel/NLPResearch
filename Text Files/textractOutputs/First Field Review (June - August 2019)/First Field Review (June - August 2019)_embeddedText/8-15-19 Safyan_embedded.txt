To Chai rwoman Chao and Mem bers of the Instructional Quality Commission:

We write as Members of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus to share our deep concerns with the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The ESMC is inaccurate and misleading in several critical respects and is drafted in a manner that reflects an anti-Jewish bias. For this reason, we are strongly opposed to the ESMC moving forward without significant revisions.

As elected representatives and mem bers of California's diverse Jewish comm unity, we have consistentl y prioritized efforts to promote inclusion and have strongly supported efforts to ensure that Cal ifornia students understand our state's com plicated history and rich diversity. However, we cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fai ls to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereoty pes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutional ize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes i n our pu blic schools. We respectfully request that the IQC address the matters outlined below.

The Draft Cu rriculu m Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and
government-and our community's longstandi ng struggle against hatred and discrimination-the
ESMC effectively erases the American Jewish experience. Indeed, notwithstanding widespread agreement that Judaism is a form of identity that is broader than reli gion, 1 and the inclusion of
religion in sample courses for African American, Native American, Latin American, and Arab American Studies,2 Jews are essentially excluded from the ESMC. We have been advised that

this exclusion appeared to be intentional and reflected the political bias of the drafters of the ESMC. This purposeful exclusion is deeply insulting, fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of ethnic studies, harmful to Jewish and non-Jewish students, and indicative of an anti Jewish bias in the ESMC that would be dangerous to institutionalize in our curriculum.
The Draft Curriculum Omits Antisemitism While the ESMC specifies the importance of studying hate crimes, white supremacy,
bias, prejudice, and discrimination, and specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of antisemitism. 3 This glaring omission is deeply troubling, especially against the backdrop of a recent surge in violent antisemitic incidents, which has included the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh-the dead liest attack on Jews in U.S. history-and the tragic shooting at the Chabad in Poway earlier this year. Moreover, while the Jewish Caucus applauds the inclusion of "Islamophobia" and other forms of discrimination in the ESMC Glossary, it is difficult to understand how a similar definition of antisemitism was not included, especially given that a majority of religiously-based hate crimes in the United States in 2017 were motivated by anti-Jewish bias.4 In sum, we find it alarming-to say the least-that at a time when Nazis are marching openly in Charlottesville chanting "Jews will not replace us," and Jews in our own state are being physically attacked in houses of worshi p, the ESMC would intentionally turn a bli nd eye to hatred and discrimination against our community. 5
The Draft Curriculum Denigrates Jews In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a
denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics that inappropriately delve into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with strong bias and little nuance, and asserts that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture," a classic antisemitic trope about Jewish control of the media.6 It is difficult to fathom why-especially at a time ofrising antisemitism and real fear in the Jewish community-the State of California would want to actively promote a narrative about Jews that echoes the propaganda of the Nazi Regime.
The Draft Curriculum Singles Out Israel for Condemnation The anti-Jewish bias of the ESMC is further reflected in its not-so-subtle promotion of
the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BOS) movement, which is widely perceived by many in the Jewish community and beyond as an effort to promote discrimination against Jews, Israelis, and/or Israeli-Americans. Notably, in stark contrast to brief and dispassionate references to other global conflicts,7 the ESMC singles out Israel-the world's only Jewish state-for special
3 Other forms of oppression and discrimination i n the ESMC Glossary incl ude Racism, Sexism, Anthropocentrism, Cisheteropatriarchy, Heteropatriarchy, Classism, Colon ia lism, Homophobia, Imperialism, Islamophobia, Patriarchy, Transphobia, White Supremacy, and Xenophobia. California State Department of Education, Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Chapter 4: Glossary and Bibliography at 1-3, 8-10, 12-13, 15-16. 4 Nearly 60 percent of hate crimes motivated by religious bias in 2017 were anti-Jewish. U.S. Dep't of Justice, 2017 Hate Crimes Statistics, Incidents and O.ffenses, available at https://ucr.tbi.gov/hate-crime/201 7/topic pages/incidents-and-offenses. 5 The failure to meaningful ly acknowledge antisemitism despite statistics and recent events is further evidence that the ESMC was drafted with an anti-Jewish bias. 6 ESMC Chapter 2 at 270. 7 See, e.g., ESMC Chapter 2 at I 05 (referencing the civil war in El Salvador), and id. at 41 (the Vietnam War).

critique and condemnation that is both out of context and factually i naccurate. 8 Singling out the Jewish State in this fashion and placing BOS alongside domestically-focused civil rights movements is especially problematic as BOS is an i nternational movement whose focus goes significantly beyond the disciplinary boundaries of American ethnic stud ies, which focuses on the experiences and struggles of ethnic groups within the United States. Moreover, contrary to the ESMC guideli nes, the references to BOS are not inclusive, and present a single viewpoi nt on an extraordinaril y complex international political dispute.9 The effort by the drafters of the ESMC to stretch to include BOS in the cutTicul um is directly contrary to establ ished California law and policy 10 and raises further quest ions about the drafters' anti-Jewish bias and effort to institutionalize the teaching of thei r own narrow pol itical ideology.
***
It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to hel p alleviate prejudice and bigotry were to i nstead marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community. Without significant edits, the ESMC will do just that. The California Legislative Jewish Caucus appreciates your consideration of the points in this letter and your review of the proposed culTiculum. We ask for your timely attention to this matter and we look forward to participating in the process moving forward.
Sincerely,

8 See, e.g., id. at 242. 9 The inclusion of BOS is also antithetical to the u nderlying val ues of ethn ic studies, as it promotes discrimination on the basis of national origin and rel igion and calls for the boycott of Israel i scholars and academic institutions regardless of thei r viewpoi nts or pol icies. 10 E.g., Assembl y Bi ll 2844, 2015-16 Leg.
