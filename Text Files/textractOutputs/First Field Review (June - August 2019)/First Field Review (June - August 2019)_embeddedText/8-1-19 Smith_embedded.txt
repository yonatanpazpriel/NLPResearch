From: Diane Smith Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 6:57 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As a Californian from five generations here and a concerned parent and grandparent, I am writing to express complete disapproval of this "course" being taught to our children who do not have an opt-out option as though it is objective truths. It clearly is divisive leftist propaganda and indoctrination. DO NOT push this on our children as "education"!
