[P2, lines 30-40] - The glossary defines BDS in a positive light without any reference to the group's anti-Semitic goals, founders, or supporters. For example, the co-founder of BDS, Omar Barghouti, said, "[Palestinians have a right to] resistance by any means, including armed resistance. [Jews] aren't indigenous just because you say you are....[Jews] are not a people...the UN's principle of the right to self-determination applies only to colonized people who want to acquire their rights. " Barghouti statement is a clear call for violence against Jews and an attempt at delegitimizing Jews as a people. In addition to its founders, many well-known supporters of BDS (i.e. Roger Waters has a big pig balloon with the image of a Jewish star at his concerts), ones in which the organization claims as their own, have used anti-Semitic language, symbols, and call for the destruction of the State of Israel. BDS incites anti-Semitism and play into Jewish stereotypes. Unless BDS is used as an example of anti-Semitism and Jew hatred, BDS should not be integrated into the curriculum.

[p. 268-269 � lines 5707-5845] � The curriculum uses a song from Shadia Monsour which contains anti-Semitic lyrics. On p. 269, lines 5818-5819, the lyric reads openly: "For every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded For each greeting, a thousand houses were demolished They use the press so they can manufacture, but when my sentence is judged, reality presents itself." The quote, "They use the press so they can manufacture," is clear anti-Semitic language that fuels Jew hatred. Artists who play into age-old Jewish stereotypes should not be mentioned in the ethnic studies curriculum. Using such artists, runs counter to the goals of the ethnic studies curriculum, feeds into Jewish stereotypes, and promotes hatred for the Jewish people.

The curriculum is filled with distortions about capitalism and economic policy. To take one example, the curriculum takes a one sided and biased approach to capitalism without considering the disastrous alternatives of socialism, democratic socialism, or communism. The curriculum does not include Jews as an ethnic minority or as a unit of study. With the rise in anti-Semitism around the country and with such attacks occurring in the Pittsburgh and Poway synagogues, overlooking Jews as a minority undercuts the entire message of the ethnic studies model curriculum, delegitimizes Jewish identity, and indirectly fuels Jew hatred. The curriculum should include a unit discussing the Jewish experience in the United States from immigration before and after the Holocaust, cooperation with the Civil Rights Movement, the experience under American anti-Semitism, as well as the American Jewish contribution to the fields of art, science, medicine, and history. Thank you in advance for taking these concerns seriously.
