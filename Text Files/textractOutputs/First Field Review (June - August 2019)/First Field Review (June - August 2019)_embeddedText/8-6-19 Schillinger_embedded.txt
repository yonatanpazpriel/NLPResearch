Pg 2; line 30 of the glossary Sample course model: 234;237;242;256;260-269 I applaud Arab education in the school system to combat Islamaphobia and promote cultural diversity. However, I do not see similar attempts to teach Jewish education in the curriculum. I do not support comments regarding the BDS movement � antisemitism by another name; a movement Congress has uniformly stood against. Additionally, to develop a curriculum that does define, teach and educate regarding antisemitism continues to support an expanding level of divisiveness tearing through our country. The FBI reports a greater than 50% increase in antisemitic attacks over the past 2 years. The horrors and the lessons of the holocaust should never be forgotten. I support Arab education but not at the expense of others.
