I have spent time looking at the document and am absolutely frightened by the purely radicalized propaganda nature of this curriculum. Pol Pot (Khmer Rouge) and the Chinese Red Guard would be impressed by the brazenness of the agenda. California has always been an ethnically diverse region and our ability to absorb immigrants has been our great strength. This curriculum is a clear attempt to institutionalize anger and prepare future "progressive" warriors for an anticipated class war. Start completely again and this time eliminate the hate.
