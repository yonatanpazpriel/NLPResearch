Why or why doesn't the state of California focus on teaching the students under their care to read, write, do math, be kind, be helpful? This VERY politically correct ethnic studies curriculum is going to drive another nail into the coffin of California ever finding its way beyond being ranked near the very bottom in successfully educating its students when compared to other states. This curriculum is anti-semitic. It teaches that democracy is racist. The jargon is just beyond understanding: `cisheteropatriarchy', `H-X-R-S-T-O-R-Y', `hybridities', `nepantla' and so on. Please start taking on your true responsibility to educate the children under your care, not indoctrinate them. I am a school board member, a retired teacher in California public schools, a 4th generation Californian, educated K-Grad School in California public schools, the grandmother of a granddaughter who is just now starting Kindergarten. If I had an alternative, I would place my granddaughter out of the reach of the indoctrinators at the State Board of Education.
