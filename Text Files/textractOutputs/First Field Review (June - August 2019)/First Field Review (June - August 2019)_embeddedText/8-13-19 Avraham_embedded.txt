From: Lior Avraham Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum embarrassment
To the California Department of Education,
I am against the proposed curriculum and glad it will go through a revision. I strongly believe that the panel that develops this curiculum be made of a panel that accurately represents our population. It is clear these "ethnic studies" experts have an agenda that is based on views many consider as radical political and deceitful. As the son of Jewish refugees from Muslim countries I am offended by your proposed designation of Israel as a colony, your omission of antisemitism and your attempted delegitimization of Israel which took my grand parents in as refugees after living in persecution and fear in Muslim countries for many generations . Please do not ever again allow our children's education to be usurped by activists with agenda. This is has always been a judeo - Christian country. Sincerely,
Lior Avraham, Esq.
