From: Marc and Susan Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education:
I would like to voice my opinion AGAINST the favorable description of BDS and the exclusion of antisemitism in the glossary of the curriculum. I also object to the unbalanced characterization of the Jewish nation versus the Palestinians in which the curriculum is heavily weighted in favor of the Palestinians.
It would seem that this curriculum is seeking to influence the students' thinking rather than provide information on both sides to allow the students to come to their own conclusions.
Please consider my comments.
Thank you!
Sincerely, Susan Carnohan
