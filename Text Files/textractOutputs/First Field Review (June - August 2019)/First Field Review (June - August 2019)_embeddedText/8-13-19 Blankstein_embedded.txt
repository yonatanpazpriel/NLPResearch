From: David Blankstein Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Sirs or Madame:
I strongly disagree with your draft curriculum on Ethic Studies.
You are openly supporting the BDS movement and omit antisemitism from the Curriculum.
I would like you to become more educated on the above subjects by having a dialogue on these issues with many of the Jewish organizations that have requested you create a more nuanced discussion of these complex issues.
Thank you,
David Blankstein
