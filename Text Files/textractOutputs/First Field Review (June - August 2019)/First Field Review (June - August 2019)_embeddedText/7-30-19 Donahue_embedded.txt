This should be stopped immediately. This is not "ethnic studies" where we truly see an objective contribution of people from various backgrounds who are Americans--or perhaps simply people from around the world-- which would be a wonderful curriculum because it would unite us all more in our humanity.
Instead, let's be honest and sincere--this is one more neo-Marxism ideology where, according to chapter 1, the following is the central ideology: "The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression, including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, that continue to impact the social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political experiences of Native People/s and people of color."

This is an introduction to Cultural Marxism, a very tainted and dangerous ideology where people all fight for victimhood instead of striving for higher order thinking via the objective application of logic and universal principles and higher moral character via virtue. It is also a static ideology:

Hispanics are currently the majority in California, so it is factually inaccurate to categorize them as a minority.

Teachers and students should never be forced to believe a dangerous, lower order thinking ideology such as Cultural Marxism. At most, students should be taught general principles of respect and kindness. To wade into by force the difficulty of biological science and tolerance while still balancing the highest priority of freedom of speech into trangenderism is extremely difficult and best left to general principles as gender dysphoria needs much love and truth to hopefully cure but if not to demonstrate tolerance and dignity. To wade into multiculturalism where we once again need mutual respect but value the rule of law that all countries have or objectively understand that not all cultures are equal, as culture is an ideology, a system of traditions, beliefs, customs, etc. is extremely difficult and to simply call someone a racist or xenophobic because they objectively state that they are against or see certain cultural behaviors as less beneficial or even harmful is wrong and stifling of truth and objectivity. And finally, already neo-Marxism is apparent in the quote as white supremacy is named directly but there is no mention of the horrors of gang violence generated by certain cultures that have struck havoc on so many communities that were secure and peaceful before. Why? Because it does not fit the static Cultural Marxist narrative. Or why not mention the Communist Revolutions of Mao and Stalin that literally killed millions of people, or the many horrors occurring in Africa due to militant tribes butchering weaker tribes, or the Trans-Saharan Slave Trade?

A much better, a truthful, a just, curriculum, would be to objectively analyze how human beings have contributed both good and bad as we seek to progress and co-exist and how we can find universal life principles to peacefully live together.

Please do not promote Cultural Marxism; there is no place in schools and children should not be indoctrinated as they so often are at the university level where anyone who disagrees with the CM ideology is punished by assigning the student failing grades, or worse, labeling them as a bigot, a racist, xenophobic, transphobic, homophobic, a white supremacist, etc. and causing huge psychological damage to young people as dominant professors stifle their freedom of speech and seek to label them unjustly, often even resulting in suspension or expulsion. We do not need this to occur in public schools for grades 7-12! Schools are obligated to teach higher order thinking; schools should never indoctrinate students and force them what to think!

History is already taught. English is already taught. There is absolutely no need for this destructive Cultural Marxist curriculum. Objective analysis of all human beings is necessary to prevent former white Anglo or Male dominance--reversing the course and instead demonizing all Western or Anglo or Male or traditional Judeo-Christian values on which America was founded, and though these should be openly debated, they should not be demonized and labeled "oppressive" when they have led to the richest, most free, most prosperous nation in the world.

In closing, let's not force indoctrination on students. And let's not open the door to an extremely predictable rebellion where teachers are forced to teach morality and social constructions that are often against their own belief systems (this is akin to forcing a religious doctrine upon teachers and students) when the inevitable dissension occurs, putting teachers and administrators in the no-win situation to either allow students to completely disagree or punish them if they state that they are not white supremacists for supporting a security wall to protect against illegal

immigrants seeking to enter the U.S. or if they state they are not xenophobic if they state they are against many Islamic teachings of polygamy or women covering their faces or if they state biologically there are two genders and a transgender person is a belief system that creates complications if someone simply identifies as being a female but looks 100% like a male and desires to enter female bathrooms, of if they state they believe, for religious views or secular views, that marriage should be defined as one man and one woman--will the teacher allow students to agree to disagree and openly exercise freedom of speech or will this student be labeled as "hateful" for such a traditional family or biblical or Koranic or Jewish view? Is there tolerance under this curriculum for dissenting views?
