--Lacks Balance--
Comment
SBE's "Guidelines for Ethnic Studies Curriculum" and CDE's "History and Social Science Framework for California Public Schools" require that all students be taught a "balanced" curriculum." The Guidelines also call for materials that give a "cultural understanding of how different groups have struggled and worked together."
This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised: The two songs that are included conflate the viewpoint of indigenous peoples in Africa and Latin America with the "Free Palestine" idea that the Jewish people somehow don't belong in the indigenous Jewish homeland. No material is included recognizing the Jews as the indigenous people of the Levant.
Suggested revision: Eliminate these songs and choose other materials that don't conflate the IsraelPalestine conflict with unrelated issues. One song that is recommended would be "Diaspora" by Young Gravy, a young Jew of color: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qy1PSKX5RE8

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised:pages 233-287 on Arab Americans devote an disproportionate amount of the curriculum to a relatively small portion of the California population. By contrast, the Jewish population in California is almost entirely erased. Many of California's Jews arrived here directly from the Middle East and North Africa as refugees from government persecution because of their religion; their stories are well documented, and memorialized in documentaries such as The Forgotten Refugees http://www.jimena.org/resources/forgotten-refugees/ and The Mizrahi Project https://www.themizrahiproject.org/, which feature first-person testimony from many Californians. They were the third wave of Jewish immigrants to the US fleeing religious persecution; the first wave being those from Eastern Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century, the second being survivors of the Holocaust, and there was a subsequent fourth wave of Jews fleeing the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Population figures from the Arab American Institute suggest that there are about 19,000 Palestinian Arabs in California (https://www.aaiusa.org/demographics). The Iranian Jewish population alone in the Los Angeles area is about 60,000 people. The fact is that even Jews whose ancestors lived more recently in Europe are also not "white", as multiple historical episodes of persecution and genocide by white Europeans attest. Therefore, any curriculum which is to focus on people of color cannot exclude Jews. The DNA of Jewish populations provides incontrovertible evidence of recent (within 2000 years) origin in the Middle East. Therefore, the exclusion of so many Jewish Americans who served major roles in expanding civil rights and equality in the United States is also an erasure from the stories of minorities in America. Whether it was rabbis such as Abraham Joshua Heschel marching arm-in-arm with Dr King at Selma, Jews who rode with African Americans as Freedom Riders, Jews who registered voters in the South (several of whom, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, were killed in the process), or community organizations such as the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish story is deeply tied in with the civil rights movement. And the historical role of the Jewish community in unionization led to Jewish support for Cesar Chavez in his efforts to unionize farm workers in California https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-forgotten-story-of-ce_b_7260814.
Suggested revision: An entire section on the Jewish communities in California, with emphasis on those who arrived as refugees.

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised:. As of 2015, there were nearly 300,000 Indian Americans in California. https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/indian-immigrants-unitedstates#Distribution_by_State_and_Key_Cities Yet Arab Americans receive about 25% of the time and space in the curriculum while the Indian American population is mentioned only in passing
Suggested revision: the amount of time devoted to specific groups in the Ethnic Studies curriculum should reflect the relative sizes of these populations in California

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised: The definition of BDS, and the polemicized language within it, are not only unbalanced but inaccurate. The goal of BDS, as defined repeatedly by its leader Omar Barghouti, is the elimination of the Jewish state of Israel. The fraudulent BDS definition of "international law" as requiring Israel to be forced to accept unlimited generations of descendants of Arab refugees from the war which the Arabs launched against the Jews is based on a nonbinding UN General Assembly resolution (UNGA 194, 1948). By the criteria adopted by the US Department of Education, BDS is an antisemitic movement because it opposes the existence of the Jewish state within any borders.The House of Representatives, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, recognized that "the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel is not about promoting coexistence, civil rights, and political reconciliation but about questioning and undermining the very legitimacy of the country and its people: "
Suggested revision: eliminate this definition entirely, or rewrite it to 1) eliminate the one sided language and 2) include the language of H Res 246 in describing it.

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised:Glossary includes a definition of Islamophobia but not antisemitism. Hate crimes against Jews are the most common against any ethnic group both nationwide and in California.
Suggested revision:add definition of antisemitism based on the IHRA definition which has been adopted by the US Department of Education.

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised:within this document https://www.mediaed.org/discussion-guides/Reel-Bad-Arabs-Discussion-Guide.pdf there is the following text: "How can one stand up against violence against Jews and simultaneously hold Israel accountable for the fiolence [sic] the state commits against Palestinians?" Then it goes on to condemn Israeli violence against Palestinians while NEVER mentioning the terror/violence committed by Palestinians against Israel or Israelis. It's a complete double standard and lacks balance
Suggested revision: use a more balanced source as a discussion guide.

This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised: "This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year." This statement, especially given the current political environment, can easily be misconstrued to suggest that the Johnson-Reed Act was a ban on Arab immigrants. Which it was NOT.
Quotas for specific countries were based on 2% of the U.S. population from each country as recorded in 1890.[2] Yes, Arabs were affected as stated, but ALL populations poorly represented in 1890 were prevented from immigrating in proportionate numbers--the Act especially affected Italians, Jews, Greeks, Poles and other Slavs.[1][3][4]
Suggested revision: The section should be re-written to correct this misunderstanding, and to include all the groups affected by the Johnson-Reed Act, along with the Arab affect.
