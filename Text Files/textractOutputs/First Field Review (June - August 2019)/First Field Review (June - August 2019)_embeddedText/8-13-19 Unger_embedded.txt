From: Toby Unger Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:16 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Against ethnic studies
I am against the ethnic studies curriculum project I feel that this is an invasion of the role of the parents. Parents should be teaching their children about ethnic diversity and directing them into any kind of political activism. You are encroaching on the role of a parent in this. I would not want my children to learn ethnic studies in school. I feel that this is my job. I do not want my children to receive political indoctrination in school. Keep politics out of school
I am a former elementary school teacher. And have a lifetime teaching credential. You should have curriculums in the core subjects of reading, math, science and history. Ethnic studies is suitable for college, not for high https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http3A__school.In&d=DwIFAg&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlA-AKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=1DLwGNEHaWcxkaY___KyGRlZWZek pKTC-gXcsXwAZCg&s=ECgWXA7T7t1Z-quWGUFjX5qA11KqJ4pF0_FY_v1vhbA&e= college, students can choose to study ethnic studies. In high school you were not allowing the students or parents choice. You are in posing it on them.
I am Jewish, and worry that anti-Semitism is going to be taught in our schools along with antiIsrael bias Toby Unger
