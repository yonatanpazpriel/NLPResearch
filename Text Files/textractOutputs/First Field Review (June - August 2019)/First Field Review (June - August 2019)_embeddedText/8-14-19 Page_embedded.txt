From: Bill Page Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 12:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ETHNIC STUDIES
PLEASE- do NOT pass the ETHNIC STUDIES curriculum ! I am strongly opposed to most of the concepts in this document!
In addition, I do not believe that you gave adequate fair notice to the general public for such a monumental change and an inadequate time for comments
California students are already suffering from many issues and they will not benefit from this changed curriculum.
DO NOT PASS THIS!
