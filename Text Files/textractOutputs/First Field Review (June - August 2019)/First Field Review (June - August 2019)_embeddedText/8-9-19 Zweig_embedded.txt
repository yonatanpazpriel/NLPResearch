California Department of Education,
I don't understand the California department of education. How can you put out something so hateful to the students of this state that only inflames the separation and hatred we are already facing with Trump in the White House. I am deeply angry at what you are trying to teach kids about Israel. I am including parts of a letter below from Sandra Sadikoff. It truly disturbs me that You are really blaming Israel for all the problems of the Palestinians but say mothing about the bombs the Palestinians shoot over to Israel. No, I am not happy with the land grab of Netanyahu and think that is wrong but the Palestinians do not want to recognize Israel and only want to see it destroyed. I would like to see this totally removed from this curriculum. We need to teach tolerance not bigotry which is what this does. It's bad enough what the White House is doing to education in this country, I thought California is better than that. This puts us in line with the bigotry in the South when you teach this kind of stuff.
Here is Sandra's letter:
`The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism.' Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. Glossary � includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. Sample Lesson Plans Page 234 � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Page 234 � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 256, 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. As a grandparent, a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division.
