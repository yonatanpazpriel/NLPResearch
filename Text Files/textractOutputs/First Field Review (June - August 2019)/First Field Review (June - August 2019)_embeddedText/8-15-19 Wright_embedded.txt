From: Mark Wright Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
The new ethnic studies curriculum is not educational it is indoctrination into the humanist religion. It teaches every thing that made our country great is oppressive. Our country became the greatest country in the world based on our values of a two parent family and capitalism. This curriculum does nothing but undermine these values.
