To include BDS as a organization, even though it was voted down in Congress, is demeaning and unnecessary. If you desire to compare the treatment of Palestinians in ALL of the MIddle East countries as well as include Israel, then by all means do so-- but to say that Israel is an apartheid state without mentioning other countries mistreatment is so wrong. Besides the fact that congress voted it DOWN. Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter

Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel--- this is a hatefilled group against the Jewish people. If you are teaching about inclusion and respect for others, and the State of Israel is a recognized country in this world, then how can you endorse this movement?

Christians by Muslim countries if you are including Israel in this same dialog? Be fair now. "The terrorist attacks The terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001"--- which attacks? It is not mentioned here where and what were the results of these attacks? "Arabs and Latinos have been the victim of increased amounts of legal, government-sanctioned surveillance and profiling."

I am trying, as a parent, to even understand this rap and it makes no sense as to why it should be taught.
"post 9/11 and after the election of president Trump" did the stereo-type and views portrayed by the media towards Muslims begin after the election of Trump? There were no movies about terrorists, television shows, books and comediac acts to demean Arabs before Trump? This is biased and unfair just as the stereotypes of Arabs are unfair, this is too. You can say post 9/11 and through the different presidents these stereotypes continued.
These two congresswoman have started many discussions on hatred of Jews-- if you want to touch on this then you have to bring up their views as well.

Were the Jewish people not important in the country we live in? Why are there no lessons on the Jewish migration, mass murder and the Holocaust and migration from Russia to the USA?
