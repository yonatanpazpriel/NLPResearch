I am concerned that the ESMC is unusually one-sided and negative in the portrayal of Jews in California and around the world. The goal in any Ethnic Studies course is to expose students to the history and culture of different groups. It would seem that the ESMC is presenting Jews in a way that is uniquely different from other groups included in the curriculum � and with a particularly negative angle.

There is a scrubbing out of the significantly positive contributions of Jews in California, America and the world (over-sized share of philanthropy, contributions to humanity measured in many ways including Nobel Prizes). And worse, although an ethnic group with a documented 3000 years of history, the focus is on the past few decades of friction in Israel, where Jews are presented in a one-sided negative light.

Indeed, Jew hating (aka Antisemitism) is outright ignored in the discussion of community biases. According the FBI, of the 7,000+ hate crimes committed in the US in 2017 (1,000+), 22% were religious based. And 60% of the religious hate crimes were against Jews. For a group that has ~3%

of the population, Jews were getting 12% of all hate crimes. And as we know, the number of attacks on Jews rose in 2018.

Of all ethnic groups, Jews are the biggest target for bias, but the ESMC is going to ignore that? Worse, is also going to add to that problem by presenting Jews badly?

Just as no group is perfect, no group is bad. Yet that is how Jews are being treated in this curriculum: excluded at best, maligned at worst.

I have my own concerns about education at Universities. I am concerned by revisionist history that goes to extremes to ignore facts in some cases and overstate in others. When the aboriginal inhabitants of a land (i.e. the Jews with a 3,000 year, uninterrupted inhabitancy in the land of Israel) are suddenly presented as outside colonialists but a colonizing group of Caliphate armies are transformed into the aborigines, I can only wonder about the politicized agendas that undermine education and the power of critical thinking in classrooms.

Please educate � don't contribute to ignorance and brainwashing. Because brainwashing is very real.
