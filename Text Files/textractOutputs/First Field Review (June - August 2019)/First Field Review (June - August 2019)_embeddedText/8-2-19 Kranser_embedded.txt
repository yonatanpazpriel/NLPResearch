Ethnic studies have been expanded here to include issues of gender, which is not ethnic and non-ethnic religious beliefs as regards to Islam. Line 16 "Ethnic study aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism . . ." This is a worthy goal, and the elimination of anti-Semitism should be included in the curriculum because there has been significant bigotry, hate, and hate-crime killings in our state, up to and including recent months, due to this scourge. Line 24 lists Islamophobia as a form of oppression. The curriculum relates this to prejudice against the Muslim faith. If religious oppression is to be included in the scope of the curriculum, then anti-Semitism deserves comparable attention. Line 456-8 includes "beliefs" and the curriculum should support persons of all beliefs and not single out Islam. Line 497 recommends accommodations for Palestinian students during Ramadan. This supportive behavior should be made towards all religious groups.

The Sample Course Modules display opinionated politicizing language that demonstrates the political leaning of those who prepared them. For examples: Line 5159 refers to the dispersal of Palestinians as the "Nakba", a charged Palestinian term that portrays only one side of the events. Line 5241 refers to "the militarization of the US-Mexico border" with large companies "scrambling" to secure defense contracts which is not an objective way to report these matters. Line 6075 in Teacher's Discussion Notes says, "Politicians are repeating Trump's anti-Muslim rhetoric causing Islamophobia to spread." I find the language disrespectful of our political leaders and the President. In my belief, this sort of editorializing does not encourage critical thinking on the part of the students.
