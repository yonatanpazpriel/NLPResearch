From: Dan and Molly Schubert Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
CA educators may well have the best interests of CA students, however, the CA legislature and the former CA governor certainly do/did, did not! Assembly Bill NO. 2016, MUST NOT be implemented. I do not care how it is done, but educators must NOT go forth with the Ethnic Studies Curriculum that is proposed in this bill. We moved to CA in 1968 and over the decades the change of education in CA has continually declined in the public schools. What this law proposes is not only ludicrous, but it is just plain wrong on so many levels. It is apparent that the majority members of the CA legislature have an agenda and every parent should not only be appalled, but also demand that it stop. We demand that CA education concentrate on those subjects that truly do prepare students to graduate with those tools, those subjects, that will be beneficial to them whether or not they further their schooling.
