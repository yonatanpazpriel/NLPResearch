I searched the document for the word "Israel." it is used 7 times. 1 occurrence (page 49 of the sample course models) is in reference to African-American Spiritual and Religious Traditions. The other 6 occurrences (pages 248, 252, 256, 257, 274, 284) are in reference to the Paliestinian people that live in or immigrated from Israel.

It appears that Israel is never mentioned as the homeland of the Jewish people for the past 6 milennia. I see multiple problems here:

1 Israel is a small country, and all ethnicities residing there are minorities on the global stage. Only the Palestinians are mentioned. This is not fair or acceptable.

2 Israel's government is predominantly made up of Jews. This is an exception to the surrounding governments in the Middle East, a region composed of predominantly Arab countries. The fact that Israel is a sovereign nation and is touted by the United States as a democratic ally in the Middle East, a politically unstable region, is never mentioned. This is not fair or acceptable.
