Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I admire the important move to include Arab American Studies in the new model curriculum for Ethnic Studies in California. It is a past due decision and I want to express my gratitude as one of the few Arab scholars who has acquired both a MA and Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies. The importance of discussing the history of racial exclusion, marginalization, oppression, of Arab immigrants in the US is vital to accounting to the contemporary forms of racialized violence we are experiencing in the US today in the War on Terror context. Further, the inclusion of how these histories of racial formations in the US are deeply tied to global events, US foreign policy and push and pull factors of migration makes the lesson plan comprehensive, ethically mature and deeply necessary. I want to particularly express my support for the inclusion of both the unit on Palestine-Mexico comparative border studies and the unit on BDS. Palestine must necessarily be taken up utilizing Ethnic Studies frameworks and methodologies. It has become the landmark cause of the current generation. Supporters of Palestinian freedom have long experienced crushing repression campaigns that attempt to silence dissent and a thoughtful open, intellectual dialogue about the issue. Incorporating the unit on Palestine is not only necessary but a demonstration that mainstream narratives that attempt to silence dissent will not be tolerable. It is a means by which Ethnic Studies can continue to stand against all forms of violence and repression that silences dissent, criminalizes knowledge access, and infringes upon academic freedom. I encourage the committee to stay true to principles of critical ethnic studies education that does not exclude Palestine, even and when, the attacks on its inclusion will mount and egregiously accuse the inclusion of a Palestinian experience as an equation with antiSemitism. As the movement for Palestinian rights grows in the US, from the White house to University campuses to the streets of California, advocates have expressed over and over again that critique of Israel is not the same as anti-Semitism or hatred toward Jews. Nothing demonstrates this more than the fact that anti-Zionist Jewish communities in the US constitute one of the largest groups advocating for an end to the occupation. Thank you for including this important unit and lesson plan suggestions.
