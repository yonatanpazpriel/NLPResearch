From: Terra Mikalson Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum Feedback
Hello,
Please find attached the feedback form. In addition, below please find general comments.
I lived in California for the first 26 years of my life. I attended California public schools and then Mills College, where I earned a BA in Ethnic Studies. As a student of the field and someone born and raised in California, I would like to give some general feedback on the curriculum.
I became aware of the curriculum project from an article my father shared with me, which critiques the curriculum guide for its treatment of Israel-Palestine. Any time you speak truth to power, you are going to get such critiques. Do not let them dissuade you from naming the apartheid conditions and the human rights abuses the state of Israel has inflicted on Palestinians.
An important part of this discussion that seems to be missing from the curriculum guide is that critiques of Israel are not inherently anti-Semitic. A broader understanding of anti-Semitism, Christian hegemony, and U.S. Christian's investment in the state of Israel would be useful here. Resources to look into include Pual Kivel's Living in the Shadow of the Cross and April Rosenblum's The Past Didn't Go Anywhere.
The field of Ethnic Studies does a better service to its students when interconnected topics are explored in more depth. Anti-Semitism operates differently than other forms of oppression, but it is still incredibly important to understand.
Thank you for your consideration.
In solidarity, Terra Mikalson
