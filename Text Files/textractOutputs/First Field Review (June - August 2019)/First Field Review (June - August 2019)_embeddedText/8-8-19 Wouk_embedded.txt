Glossary P2 ï¿½ The laudatory definition of BDS makes it appear far less

controversial than it is. "Apartheid conditions' is not an accurate description of

the plight of Palestinians in either Israel or not-quite-Palestine. See Wikipedia

for a more balanced approach:

Sample Course Models does not include Jews as an ethnic group, or more

269 & general

appropriately a collection of ethnic groups, similar to Native Americans or Arab

Americans in that respect. It should. P 234: `Call to Boycott, Divest and Sanction

Israel' and `Comparative border studies: Palestine and Mexico' arguably do not

belong in a discussion of Arab or Muslim Americans at all. Israel is a foreign

country on the other side of the world, of largely symbolic value to anyone on this

continent. P 237: `Israel-Palestine' is not a country. Israel is a country and

Palestine would like to be one. Hyphenating them is a compromise that

obscures the reality. P 264-269: The song doesn't belong in a curriculum

unless it focuses on Middle Eastern politics and can put it in a less partisan

context. There is a difference between exploring the lives of Americans of

different ethnicities, who are all present and able to consult their own experience,

and including material about events that those present cannot experience and

evaluate for themselves.

General Nina Wouk

`A deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion' and `the eradication of

bigotry, hatred and racism' are necessary goals. They are not consistent with

this curriculum leaving out Jewish Americans, and presenting Jews only as

Israeli villains. Jewish Americans are being threatened by the same white

supremacists that target everyone else who isn't white enough for Richard

Spencer. All the threatened communities need to learn about each other, and

how to stand up for each other. Hang together or hang separately.
