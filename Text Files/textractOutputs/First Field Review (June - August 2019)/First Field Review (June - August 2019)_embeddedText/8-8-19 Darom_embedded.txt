[Page 234, line 4957�BDS should not be a part of any curriculum unless the purpose is only to show how wrong it is to boycott a state is] Page 237, line 5030 � there is no such thing as "Israel-Palestine" Page 242, line 5160 � there are two sides to that "Nakba" story, the one mentioned here outlines only one side. This will give students the wrong impression regarding the events that happened around that time (i.e. how all Arab nations launched an attack on Israel right after it declared its independence, which was backed by a UN decision in 1947). Pages 268-269, lines 5794-5804 � this verse calls for uprising and aggression against Israel, this should not be taught in any school.
