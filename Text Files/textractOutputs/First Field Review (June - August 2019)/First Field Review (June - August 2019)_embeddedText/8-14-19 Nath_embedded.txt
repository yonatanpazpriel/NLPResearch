The proposed curriculum is duplicitous and unacceptable. Purporting to teach about marginalized communities, it marginalizes Jews; omits antisemitism; ignores the holocaust; demonizes Israel; and actively eviscerates the Jewish experience as an immigrant narrative.

To date, 27 states have adopted laws that are designed to discourage boycotts against Israel. Separately, the U.S. Congress is considering anti-boycott legislation as well in reaction to the BDS movement. The Senate passed S.1 which contains anti-boycott provisions on January 28, 2019, by a vote of 74-19. The House passed a resolution condemning the boycott of Israel on July 24, 2019, by a vote of 398-17.

Tennessee
April 21, 2015
The Tennessee General Assembly formally condemned the BDS movement in a 123-1 vote with the passing of SJR-170, becoming the first state in the country to do so. Although the legislation does not order Tennessee public institutions to divest from entities involved in the BDS movement, it refers to BDS as, "one of the main vehicles for spreading antiSemitism and advocating the elimination of the Jewish state." The legislation also stated that BDS is, "deeply damaging to the causes of peace, justice, equality, democracy and human rights for all the peoples in the Middle East."
South Carolina
June 4, 2015
South Carolina's state legislature passed legislation banning the state from entering into contracts with companies that participate in certain kinds of boycotts. Unlike the Illinois measure, South Carolina's H-3583 bill is in no way limited to companies that boycott Israeli firms. Rather, the legislation refers to companies that boycott "a person or an entity based in or doing business with a jurisdiction with whom South Carolina can enjoy open trade." This legislation was signed by South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley on June 4, 2015.
Illinois
July 23, 2015
The Illinois state legislature unanimously passed landmark anti-BDS legislation on May 18, 2015, and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner became the first state leader to sign anti-BDS legislation into law on July 23, 2015. The bill, SB-1761, targets taxpayer funded public pension funds that invest in companies which have adopted a BDS stance towards Israel. Per the legislation, companies that boycott Israel in Illinois were added to restricted company lists which undergo periodic

Public Input Template�2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Page 3 of 16
review and are sent around to managers at all taxpayer funded public pension funds. The passage of this bill was hailed as the first state-based, concrete action taken against the BDS movement in the United States. The legislation was approved by the Governor on July 23, 2015.
Alabama
February 16, 2016
Alabama Governor Robert Bentley signed SJR-6 into law on February 16, 2016, after it had been unanimously passed by the state legislature the previous week. The legislation states that the activities of the BDS movement in Alabama are, "harmful to the State's relationships with Alabama's Jewish citizens," and expresses unconditional support for Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state. The legislation goes on to, "unequivocally denounce and reject the international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement and any furtherance of this movement in this state."
Governor Bentley signed the anti-discrimination bill SB81 on May 10, 2016, which prevents Alabama government entities from contracting with companies engaged in Israel boycotts.
Colorado
February 26, 2016
The Colorado House of Representatives passed HB-16-284 on February 26, 2015. The legislation orders the state Public Employee Retirement Association (PERA) to identify all companies that participate in the BDS movement and add their names to a list of restricted companies. The bill then requires PERA to send notice to the company alerting them of their

Public Input Template�2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Page 4 of 16
status, and if the company does not stop supporting BDS activities within 180 days of notification the legislation requires PERA to divest from that company. This list of restricted companies is to be reviewed on an annual basis. The legislation was signed into law by Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper on March 18, 2016.
Indiana
March 1, 2016
In a 47-3 vote, the Indiana State Senate approved anti-BDS legislation on March 1, 2016. The House had approved the legislation in January. The bill, HB-1378, requires mandatory state divestment from any company that participates in, "the promotion of activities to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel." The language in the bill targets settlements as well, including "territories controlled by the Jewish State of Israel," in the anti-BDs measure. As of December 2016 the legislation had still not been approved by Indiana Governor Mike Pence.
Florida
March 10, 2016
Florida's State Legislature passed SB-86 on February 24, 2016, with bipartisan support, sending a message that they benefit from their relations with Israel and do not support the BDS movement, companies associated with it, or it's agenda. In early March the Florida Senate passed an adjusted version of the bill calling for the repeal of U.S. Customs and Border Protection's "West Bank country of origin marking requirements," which prevent West Bank products being labelled as "Made in Israel."

On March 10, 2016, the Florida House of Representatives passed HB-527, directing the State Board of Administration create a list of companies that engage in boycotts of Israel, and instructing all government entities to divest from companies listed. On the same date, Florida governor Rick Scott signed SB-86.
Florida Governor Rick Scott signed HB-545 into law in a ceremony at the Orlando Torah Academy on March 30, 2018. The anti-BDS bill prevents companies that engage in boycotts of Israel from bidding on local or state government contracts.
Virginia
March 10, 2016
Both Virginia Houses of Delegates passed identical resolutions condemning the actions of the BDS movement in early March 2016. The legislation voices support for a negotiated 2-state solution, and states that Virginia "oppose[s] all attempts to economically and politically isolate Israel within the international arena, including promotion of economic, cultural, and academic boycotts." Virginia lawmakers referred to the BDS movement as "inherently antithetical and deeply damaging to the causes of peace, justice, equality, democracy, and human rights for all peoples in the Middle East." Virginia's Jewish community issued a statement thanking the legislators for passing the resolution.

Arizona
March 18, 2016
On March 14, 2016, Arizona's House of Representatives passed legislation prohibiting state investment in companies that participate in the BDS movement, and requiring all entities contracting with the state to certify that they are not involved in boycotts of Israel. The legislation, HB-2617, passed the House with a 42-16-2 vote, after having passed the Senate the previous week. The legislation was signed into law by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey on March 18, 2016.
In September 2018, a federal judge issued an injunction, blocking enforcement of the measure.The state appealed the ruling. Rather than go through with the appeal, the legislature passed new a new law in April 2019, which "limits the antiboycott certification to for-profit companies with more than 10 employees and government contracts worth more than $100,000," according to the ACLU. This means that many individuals and businesses who contract with the government are no longer subject to the certification. While the law makes reduces the number of contractors affected, it may also be challenged in the courts.
Georgia
April 26, 2016
Georgia's SB-327 was approved by the State Senate on February 26, 2016, in a 45-6 vote.

New York
June 5, 2016
An anti-BDS resolution was passed with a near-unanimous vote in the New York State Assembly on June 22, 2015. The resolution denounced the BDS movement, stating, "this legislative body is concerned that the international Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement and its agenda are damaging to the causes of peace, justice, equality, democracy, and human rights for all peoples in the Middle East." The legislation reiterated the close ties that New York shares with the Jewish state as well.
The New York State Senate approved a bill that prohibits the state and state entities from doing business with companies that support the BDS movement on January 20, 2016. The bill, S-6378A, is currently on the docket for the State Assembly to vote on. This legislation would prohibit state contracting with or investments in companies or individuals that engage in boycott, divestment, or sanctioning activities against Israel.
On June 5, 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an executive order requiring state agencies to divest from organizations and companies that participate in Israel boycotts. Cuomo described BDS as an "economic attack" on Israel during a speech at Manhattan's Harvard Club, and stated that "If you boycott against Israel, New York will boycott you." The Governor chose to issue an executive order instead of bringing the issue to the state legislature because passing legislation can be "a tedious affair," and he wanted to take "immediate action," against the BDS movement. Under the order, the Commissioner of the Office of General Services of New York was commanded to put together a list of businesses and groups involved in the BDS movement, based on "credible information available to the public."

Michigan
January 10, 2017
Michigan Governor Rick Snyder signed his state's anti-BDS legislation on January 10, 2017, making Michigan the first state to stand against the BDS movement that year. The bills, HB 5821 and 5822, were passed by the state House and Senate during the previous month. Michigan state agencies, according to the legislation, "may not enter into a contract with a person to acquire or dispose of supplies, services, or information technology unless the contract includes a

Public Input Template�2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Page 11 of 16
representation that the person is not currently engaged in, and an agreement that the person will not engage in, the boycott of a person based in or doing business with a strategic partner."
Arkansas
March 22, 2017
Governor William Hutchinson signed a law, Act 710, to prohibit Arkansas agencies from investing in or contracting with companies that boycott Israel. The new act ensures that Arkansas taxpayer funds will not finance the anti-Semitic tactics of the BDS movement. Boycotts have "become a tool of economic warfare" in Arizona that "threatens the sovereignty and security of key allies and trade partners," namely, the State of Israel. Act 710 maintains that the strategic refusal to engage in commercial relations with Israeli trade partners is discriminatory and unsound. The legislation guarantees state divestment of companies that "support or promote actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel."
The law also law requires state contractors to pledge not to boycott Israel or reduce their fees by 20 percent if they don't sign the pledge. In January 2019, a federal judge dismissed the lawsuit the Arkansas Times had filed challenging the law.

Texas
May 2, 2017
Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed HB89, an act relating to state contracts with and investments in companies that boycott Israel, on May 2, 2017. The bill prohibits the State of Texas from contracting or entering into business with companies or entities involved in the BDS movement against Israel. The law ensures that public funds will not go to companies that participate in BDS.
In 2019, Texas started to divest $72 million worth of stock in the Norwegian financial services firm DNB ASA. Two state pension funds � the Employees Retirement System of Texas and Texas Permanent School Fund -- own $68 million and $4 million, respectively, in stock in the company. This is the first action taken under the anti-boycott legislation.
In April 2019, a U.S. District Judge ruled in favor of Bahia Amawi, a former speech pathologist who sued the state over the law after she was fired from her job for supporting BDS. The court found "the statute to be a viewpoint-based restriction intended not to combat discrimination on the basis of national origin, but to silence speech with which Texas disagrees."
In response, the legislature rewrote the language limiting the application of the law to companies with more than 10 fulltime employees and contracts of more than $100,000 with the state. The governor signed the bill, which "primarily makes our original intent clear, which is that it was not to pertain to small contracts and individuals," according to Texas Sen. Brandon Creighton.

The ACLU of Texas maintains the bill is still unconstitutional, despite its narrowed scope.
Minnesota May 3, 2017 Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton signed his state's anti-BDS legislation into law on May 3, 2017, after it had passed the State House and Senate with respective votes of 98 - 28 and 57 - 8.

Nevada June 2, 2017 After it unanimously passed the Nevada State Legislature a week earlier and the State Senate the month before, Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval signed Nevada's very own anti-BDS legislation on June 2, 2017. With the signing of the bill, Nevada became the 20th state to pass laws prohibiting state institutions and government bodies from doing business with those who unfairly boycott Israel. Governor Sandoval had travelled to Israel with a delegation of Nevada businessmen in 2013, to encourage investment and business cooperation with his state. Kansas June 16, 2017

Kansas Governor Sam Brownback signed HB 2409 into law on June 16, 2017, prohibiting state agencies from contracting with entities that engage in Israel boycotts. The legislation passed both the Kansas Senate and House during the previous week, in respective votes of 39-3 and 99-13.
In February 2018, a federal judge temporarily blocked the law in response to a lawsuit. Subsequently, in April, the Legislature amended the law so the anti-boycott certification requirement no longer applies to individuals or sole proprietors and only to companies that conduct more than $100,000 worth of business with the state. Those companies must now state that they are "not engaged in a boycott of goods or services from Israel that constitute an integral part of business conducted or sought to be conducted with the state."
Following the changes in the law, the ACLU dropped its objection to the law.
North Carolina
July 31, 2017 After passing the State House of Representatives by a vote of 96-19, and the State Senate in a 45-3 vote, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper signed his state's anti-BDS legislation into law on July 31, 2017.

Hogan stated that all future contract requests for state bids must include language that the applicant has not refused to do business with any person or entity based on their Israeli origin. The order also calls for all current state contracts to be evaluated and possibly terminated if they exist with companies that engage in the boycott of Israel.
Wisconsin
October 27, 2017
Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker signed Executive Order #261 into law on October 27, 2017, prohibiting state agencies from entering into contracts with entities that participate in Israel boycotts.

Kentucky
November 15, 2018
Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin signed an executive order banning the award of state contracts to companies that participate in campaigns to boycott Israel. The order states the "Commonwealth of Kentucky unequivocally rejects the BDS movement and stands firmly with Israel."
