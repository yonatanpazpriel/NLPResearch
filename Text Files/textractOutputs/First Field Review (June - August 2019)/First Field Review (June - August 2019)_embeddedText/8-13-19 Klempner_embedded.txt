Sample Course Models do not mention Jewish Americans as being included, nor AntiSemitism, despite Jewish Americans being singled out for hate attacks at an alarming rate.
Multiple forms of bias are included, but again, no mention of Anti-Semitism. Also, the language used (and encouraged) is so politically-correct or trendy as to turn off casual users, including those who most need the curriculum! Please, no "hxrstory," "cisheteropatriarchy," or lazy "xdisciplinary"! There are ways to create buy-in without being confusing, overly political, or attacking. How is it that Islamophobia gets an entry in the glossary, but not Anti-Semitism even though attacks against Jews rose more in California last year than hate crimes against Muslims? And why does the BDS definition not mention that some of its tactics and language have been called out by Jews--including many in the Social Justice movement--as being Anti-Semitic?

On page 2, a course is recommended that singles out many ethnic groups for study, but doesn't mention Jewish-Americans, despite their long history in this country and their marked history of hate-based attacks.
Starting on page 17 � There are many beautiful literature and film selections reflecting America's diversity included in this course's literature selections-- many are strongly researched or present first-person narratives which engage and teach people how to see the world through others' eyes.
Contrast this to mentions of the travel ban against citizens of several mostlyMuslim nations on page 117. Every single reading suggested on the topic assumes the ban is wrong (personally, I do believe the ban is wrong). Those are opinions, not always from first person (which engages empathy and teaches POV), about a highly political issue which does have another side (even though I disagree with it). Students can be taught Ethnic Studies without being told how to think. Teach them to read both sides and then analyze them! Teach them to reason and wrestle!
I have similar concerns with mentions of Black Lives Matter on pages 152, 153-- I believe it is important to teach about BLM, however, the approach here is very political, and advocates only the "pro" BLM position. It's important to teach students to be exposed to multiple points of view, and then to think and decide for themselves; here it seems only one side of the issues at hand and one approach is being endorsed by the course materials.
Likewise, a few pages later, there is discussion of Dreamers and immigration. While I personal support Dreamers and want open boarders, that's a political belief. It's important that students be exposed to the issues at hand, be educated in statistics and research regarding immigration, how to root out and tune out fake news...but also to make their own opinions, rather than being spoonfed a political agenda in the classroom.
