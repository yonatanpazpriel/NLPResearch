From: Nina Weil Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 8:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Thank you,
