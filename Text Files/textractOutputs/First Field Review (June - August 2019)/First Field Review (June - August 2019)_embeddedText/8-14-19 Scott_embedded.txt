Page 1: Omits a definition of anti-Semitism, and page 2 for including a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions). Problematic Topics: Page 234: 4956 Line Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter; 4957 Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel; 4958 Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico. Page 242, the ESMC uses politically biased language to refer to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61) and on pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) it uses the antiSemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.

As a Jew raising 2 children in the California public schools, I am aghast to see the complete disregard of Jewish contribution and the antisemitism encouraged by BDS. For example, by teaching BDS to my JEWISH children, you are supporting the following (and teaching this to my children!):
 "By comparing Jewish refugees fleeing persecution in Europe, Arab countries and the larger world to the white colonization of North America, which was largely driven by economic desires, BDS erases history and invalidates key aspects of Judaism that have advocated a return to "Zion" for thousands of years."1
 "BDS ignores any Palestinian responsibility. The BDS organizers appear to believe that only Israeli policies are an obstacle to justice for Palestinians. No mention is made of the corruption and bad decisions or politics within Gaza or the West Bank." 1
 "The BDS movement website does not acknowledge any Jewish rights. It does not talk about a future where Palestinians live with Israelis. By avoiding the topic, BDS looks as if it opposes the state of Israel and all of its 6.5 million Jewish citizens. There is no attempt to assure Jews that Palestinians want to live with Israelis or quell fears of removing Jews."1
