From: Josh Austin Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 1:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment on the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern,
I am a teacher at Berkeley High School, the first public high school in the United States with an African American Studies department.
I'm enthusiastic about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and its focus on people of color in California. This is especially relevant at this time given the 50th anniversary of Ethnic studies.
Please keep the curriculum intact without amendments.
Thank you, Josh Austin
