Page 1 omits a definition of antisemitism; and page 2 includes a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions). Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61); and pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.

*Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East with Jews, Muslims, Christians, Catholics, Bahia's and many other religions living happily enjoying all of Israel's government benefits as well as its democratic laws.
