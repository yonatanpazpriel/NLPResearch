This new radical curriculum is a classic example of why my wife and I (and kids) left CA in 2010 and never regretted it. The state has gone completely insane.
When we left CA, we took about $150,000/year in state and local taxes with us. You will never see any of it again. In addition, my engineering firm has stopped all future donations, especially corporate matching, to any CA college or university, and will not hire any "graduates" from a CA school. We know what and who you are, and will not support your agenda in any way. Dr David Nahrstedt Oak Ridge, TN
