1.The curriculum needs to include Jews among its ethnic groups. They are a minority that has been oppressed in our country (think restrictive covenants, job discrimination, quotas) but managed to be a significant contributor to our society. (What would we miss if there were no Jews?--the polio vaccine, insulin, aspirin, the iPhone and much more.)

much as it focuses on sexism, Islamophobia, white supremacy and other forms of oppression. There is little mention of anti-Semitism despite its historical prominence and the current resurgence--think of the tragedies at synagogues in Pittsburgh and Poway. There were 1,879 anti-Semitic incidents across the country in 2018, the third-highest year on record since the 1970s. 2. Discussion around the creation of the State of Israel is inaccurate. It includes nothing about the Holocaust, which showed the need for a Jewish state (there was NO safe place for Jews to go during the Holocaust). Remember the SS St. Louis whose Jewish passengers the U.S. turned away. The curriculum needs to be objective about the IsraeliPalestinian conflict-- where is the Israeli viewpoint?

Nor are Mideastern ethnic subgroups of Jews included in the curriculum although many other ethnicities are included.

An opposing point of view the BDS movement needs to be presented. If you connect the dots, you find groups who want Israel destroyed are prime supporters of that movement. And BDS is detrimental to the sharing of science and the arts. And why is there a focus on criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to promote inclusiveness? There should, instead, be an emphasis on understanding of and respect for Jewish beliefs and practices.
