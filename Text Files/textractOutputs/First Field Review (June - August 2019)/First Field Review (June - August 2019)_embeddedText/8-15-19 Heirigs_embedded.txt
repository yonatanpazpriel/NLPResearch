From: Anne Heirigs Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Revisions to the Ethnic Studies
To whom it may concern,
this revision to the ethnic studies is so over the top. Forcing your values on our children, and our children not yours is wrong. You may have your opinions, but we too have ours. This is a violation of our freedom to choose. I am a parent and a college student. This type of crap is in the colleges already. I am grown and can choose what I want and do not want to believe. But you are forcing your beliefs on the little children, my children is unacceptable. California has been doing so really insane things, but this? This is too fair!!!
It's starting to sound like Lenin. You know him the communist. He said, " Give me four years to teach the children and the seed I have sown will never be uprooted." Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
