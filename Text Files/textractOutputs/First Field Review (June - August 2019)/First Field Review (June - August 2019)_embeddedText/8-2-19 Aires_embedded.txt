From: Ian Aires Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 9:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New curriculum
Please note that in order for the new curriculum to be factually correct information about the Jews and the Holocaust needs to be included. Also the facts of 1948 needs to be discussed wherein the United Nations agreed to the establishment of a Jewish State. Respectfully Ian Aires.
