I believe there is too much emphasis on supposed oppressions committed by whites on oppressed groups (minorities) without a balancing acknowledgement of the contributions of whites. Whites have created a country that, in spite of its defects, continues to attract immigrants in large numbers. Line 121 uses the word "despite" incorrectly. It should not be followed by "of".

My greater concern in the proposed sample course models is the emphasis on victimhood and on the support of a "progressive" political agenda. For example, I don't believe it will, ultimately, be helpful to dwell on the dream of reparations for slavery. In the interest of enabling all ethnic groups to cooperate there should be less negativity and more focus on opportunities and accomplishments in each ethnic group. In my opinion there is far too much effort to place blame for all the ills on whites and to ignore the advances made possible by whites.
