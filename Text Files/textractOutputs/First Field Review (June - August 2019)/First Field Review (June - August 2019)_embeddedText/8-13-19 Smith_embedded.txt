From: KEVIN SMITH Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Response to the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I write to you in great urgency in response to the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, with which I have many concerns. The ostensible purpose of California's new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is to build a shared understanding of ethnic groups' perspectives and engage minority students in school, but it is replete with anti-Semitic tropes, one-sided bias highlighting the BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement against Israel, and demonization of Israel. Crucially, there is no mention of anti-Semitism. In addition, many sections in the ESMC are inaccurate, misleading and unbalanced. As the California Legislative Jewish Caucus wrote, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
Highlights of specific concerns with the curriculum include:
� Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned. � Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-
based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. � The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no
balancing perspective. � A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included.
Thank you. I am anxiously awaiting these changes to be made to the proposed plan.
