The new curriculum for ethnic studies totally ignores Jewish American history and the anti-semitism that Jews experienced in this country for many years, and the recent rise of it recently. The curriculum also demonizes Israel and misrepresents the only free and democratic country in the middle east. This is the new anti-semitism. So I don't support the new curriculum. It must change to be more balanced, and it must be based on facts.
