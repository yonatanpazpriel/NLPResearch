From: Michelle Nikkhoo Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 9:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Stop Anti-Israel Hate in California Public Schools
My name is Michelle Abbott. My husband and I have four children in Los Angeles public schools. We have a child at Palisades High School, a child at Paul Revere Middle School, and two children at Kenter Canton Elementary school. Hence, these biases (set forth below) directly impact my children and family.
My husband and I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum, specifically page 2 of the Glossary and Bibliography, and pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of Sample Course Models.
We urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
Best, Michelle Abbott
