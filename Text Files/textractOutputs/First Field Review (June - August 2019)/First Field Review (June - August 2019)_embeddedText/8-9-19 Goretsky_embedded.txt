Per the objections stated by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, the current ESMC is anti-Israel and anti-Semitic in nature. I agree with the Caucus' findings below:
� The ESMC Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience: Despite the significant contributions that Jews have made to California history, politics, culture and government � and the Jewish community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � Jews are essentially omitted as an ethnic group in the ESMC.
� The ESMC Omits Anti-Semitism: While the ESMC specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of antiSemitism. The ESMC Glossary includes the terms Racism, Sexism, Anthropocentrism, Cisheteropatriarchy, Heteropatriarchy, Classism, Colonialism, Homophobia, Imperialism, Islamophobia, Patriarchy, Transphobia, White Supremacy, and Xenophobia. It does not include the term Anti-Semitism.
� The ESMC Denigrates Jews: In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture" � a classic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews control the media.
� The ESMC Singles Out Israel for Condemnation: The ESMC promotes the antiSemitic, anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and singles out Israel � the only Jewish state in the world � for special criticism and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate.

In addition, three advisory committee members have questionable backgrounds and motives, as stated in a recent Jewish News Syndicate article by Jackson Richman and Sean Savage:

"Three of the 18 members on the (ESMC) advisory committee in developing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum include Gaye Theresa Johnson, Theresa Montano and

Samia Shoman; are all academics documented for their anti-Israel sentiments and outright bias.
"Johnson, who teaches Chicano and African-American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, co-authored an article that included an interview with former Black Panther Party member Angela Davis that was sympathetic to Davis's views on Israel and BDS.
"Montano, vice president of the California Teachers Association and a professor of Latino studies at California State University, Northridge, signed the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel petition supporting the academic boycott of Israel.
"Shoman, a manager of English Learner & Compliance programs in the San Mateo Union High School District, taught in the Arab and Muslim Ethnicities and Diasporas (AMED) program at San Francisco State University and talks widely on how to teach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at the high school level.
"She has further signed a petition accusing Israel of being a `racist,' `apartheid' state, engaging in "ethnic cleansing," and treating Palestinians in `a savagely racist way,' in addition to calling on a local food store to `boycott all Israeli goods.' "
I officially request the three above-named individuals to be immediately removed from the advisory committee, and for all anti-Israel and antiSemitic references to be deleted from the curriculum prior to dissemination.
