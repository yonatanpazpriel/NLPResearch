While I laud the creation of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum I believe it needs serious revision for the following reasons: Concern regarding the emphasis on experiences of people of color, the description of BDS and the definition Diaspora, how students should label a map of the Middle East, and calling the Israel War of Independence the Palestine War. Concern regarding the emphasis on experiences of people of color - not including the current rise of anti-Semitism nor the anti-Irish, anti-Italian bias in the early 1900's. I do not support all of Israel's actions but, they in no way constitute apartheid as was seen in South Africa. The root of the problem goes back to the aftermath of the 1948 War that established the State of Israel. Palestinians in the Western Galilee were told to flee by their leaders not by future Israelis. The refugees were not allowed to settle in the adjoining Arab countries but kept in camps by Arabs. Definition of Diaspora has its roots in Deuteronomy 28:25 and refers to the original dispersed and most often dispersed people, the Jews. Which should be acknowledged here as an early harbinger of ethnic bias.

Having students identify the State of Israel as Israel-Palestine is incorrect. The teacher needs to have a large enough map to be able to have the students identify the West Bank and Gaza. The war in 1948 is not called the "Palestine War". It is known as Israel's War of Independence. Understanding the difference in context of World History is vital and needs to be understood. I personally lived in the Western Galilee with Arab neighbors who returned to their ancestral lands after the '48 War. They offered us help during the '73 War when things weren't looking so good. There are two sides to the story and only on is being presented here. I suggest leaving BDS out of the sample course if you are not going to include ANTI-SEMITISM.
