I applaud this exemplary work. The vision is compelling and the topics and themes integrate well with the 2016 H-SS Framework. I will add some commentary that I intend as complementary rather than as an alternative.
Grade 9 pp. 310 to 314 of the 2016 H-SS framework provides guidance for ethnic studies. For example:

"Because of the interdisciplinary nature of this field, ethnic studies courses may take several forms. However, central to any ethnic studies course is the historic struggle of communities of color, taking into account the intersectionality of identity (gender, class, sexuality, among others), to challenge racism, discrimination, and oppression and interrogate the systems that continue to perpetuate inequality. From a history�social science perspective, students may study the history and culture of a single, historically racialized group in the United States. Examples may include a course on African American, Asian American, or Chicana/o and Latina/o history."

My general belief regarding most or all of the Grade 9 H-SS topics in the Framework is that these are intended, ideally, to inform, imbue and continue throughout the H-SS curriculum in Grades 10-12 (and 6-8, K-5). As examples, Ethnic Studies, Women's Studies, Geography, World Religions, Anthropology, Sociology, Humanities, etc., are not 9th grade one-and-done topics, but rather support and inform World and US History, Economics, and Government. After all, we are not teachers of Subject Content but rather teachers of students - Inquiry, Literacy, Citizenship. By and large, though there have been huge improvements, we are still guilty of teaching H-SS through a Euro-Centric and Male-Centric lens. I believe that we must integrate all of these topics throughout the fabric of all H-SS content. It's an ecosystem, everything connects, and yet, so often, we still insist on silos.
