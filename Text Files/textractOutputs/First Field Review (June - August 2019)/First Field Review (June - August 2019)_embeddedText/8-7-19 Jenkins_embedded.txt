From: Lisa Jenkins Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 8:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Study Model Curriculum:
The role model for the curriculum in ethnic studies is horrible! How can you at the education board even consider this? Caeser Chavez studied in how to overthrow governments and how to cause upheavel, furthermore, other means that he studied were shut down because of terrorism and murder, kidnappings and violence. Also under this so called model citizen Chevez; he studied on how to bully, ridicule and physically hurt people. Chavez also studied false religions. This Chavez is NO model citizen, he is a radical who studied Saul Alinsky and other radical troublemakers.The model curriculum is bad as well; full of hate, corruption and will further turn your state of California into even more of a problematic place. California already has rats, garbage and disease, do you want to add homegrown terrorists to the list too? Because to follow after a corrupt model as Chavez and to teach K-12 this type of curriculum, you are asking for trouble. I urge you to pull this corrupt model-Chavez and this corrupt curriculum from California Education.
