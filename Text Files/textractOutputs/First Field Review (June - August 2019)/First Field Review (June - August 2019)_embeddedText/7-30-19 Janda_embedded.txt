I really hope you are receiving overtly negative feedback on this curriculum.
As stated in line 317/318 of the intro document, "Ethnic Studies teaching is grounded in the belief that education can be a tool for transformation, social change ...." This clearly implies the author of this curriculum has an agenda.
And I firmly believe education should NOT be used as tool for social change. Education gives student the tools to analyze situations for themselves and develop perspectives and insights, which may lead to social change. Education job is teaching critical thinking, not indoctrination to someone's agenda.
Also on in the section begin on lines 306, it describes capitalism as a form of oppression and power. While I wholeheartedly disagree with this statement, I would be okay exploring it IF, we also explored other economic systems as a form of oppression and power including socialism, communism, etc. which I believe are more oppressing and power hungry than capitalism.
Please please stop this misguided (at best) model curriculum.
