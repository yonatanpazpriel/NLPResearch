From: Gail Teton-Landis Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:58 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment Hello, In general I support the Ethnic Studies curriculum. However I am concerned over parts of the Arab American Studies ou line that call for BDS of Israel, the use of political biased language when discussing the founding of Israel, the antiSemitic trope of the relationship to Jews and the media, and the lack of discussion of antisemitism in the glossary and bibliography. I hope you will reconsider this part of the curriculum. Thank you,
