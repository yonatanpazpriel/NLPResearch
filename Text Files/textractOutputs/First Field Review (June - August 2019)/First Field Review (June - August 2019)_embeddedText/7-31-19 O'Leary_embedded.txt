[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] Kevin O'Leary, Flight Instructor. San Diego resident. My comment: Line 306-308, Chapter 1, Introduction and Overview states the following as one of this curriculum's goals:
critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society; Teaching our children that capitalism is a form of "oppression" and lumping in

the same category as "racism" and "white supremacy" is offensive, wrong,

and purposefully misguiding our youth. I feel like the goal of this new

curriculum nothing short of brainwashing. I found so many other ideas and

concepts in this document that are just elaborate opinions, and have nothing

underperforms in math and science year after year after year. As a future parent, if this curriculum goes into effect, I promise you 100% my kids will be homeschooled or go into private school, and I won't be alone. What you are trying to advance is an agenda, not education, and I find it dangerous. I will do everything in my ability to inform everyone I can about your scheme, including Fox News, to try and get the word out. I guarantee you if this becomes state curriculum, you will see a mass exodus from the public education system.
