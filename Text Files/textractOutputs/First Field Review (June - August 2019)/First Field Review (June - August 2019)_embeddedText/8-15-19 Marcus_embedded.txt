Dear Committee:
I am greatly concerned about the curriculum draft proposed by the CA department of Education with regard to the Ethnic Studies curriculum. I am shocked, frankly, to read the racist comments everyday in our country and as a CA resident have always wondered how people live anywhere else in this country. Today I feel differently. I am CA taxpayer and have raised my own children in CA public schools which I greatly support - including through involvement over the years as a member of PTA's, Parent groups, etc.
This is beyond appalling and shocking that the draft curriculum be such a blatant neglect of the American Jewish narrative; omits discussion of antisemitism as a form of bias and hatred; does not sufficiently reflect Jewish ethnic and cultural identity; and unfairly calls Israel out for condemnation.
If CA is to remain of beacon of cultures and different ethnic communities living together, respectfully, this draft needs to be greatly changed.
Thank you,
Janet
