Pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269 I am very concerned and dismayed about inclusion of material in a public school curriculum that promotes the BDS movement, and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. The BDS movement promotes division and hatred, not peace and inclusion. Antisemitism is one of the oldest, most persistent forms of prejudice, and needs to be included in any curriculum dealing with marginalized communities. Please remove any anti-Israel material from the curriculum. It would be appropriate to include lessons in prejudice against American Jewry (which is on the rise today) as well as the history of Jewish refugees from the Holocaust and from oppression in the former Soviet Union. Thank you.
