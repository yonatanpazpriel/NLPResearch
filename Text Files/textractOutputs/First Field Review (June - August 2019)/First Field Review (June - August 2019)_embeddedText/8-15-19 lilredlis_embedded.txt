Ethnic Studies should not value one group over another. All groups and country origins should be covered in the curriculum, including European and Jewish. The curriculum should reinforce the idea that the United States is made up of people of all races, ethnicities, religions, economic statuses, etc. and that, especially in America no group is more important than another. Selfintegration should be encouraged, rather than the self-segregation we are seeing in many schools today (the "blacks" hanging out together, as do the "Mexicans", "Indians", etc.). The selfsegregation discourages individuals from getting to know those who are different from them.
In an Ethnic Studies curriculum, I would like to see more of a these are the wonderful qualities of those in this ethnic group, rather than a this ethnic group treated this other ethnic group poorly and therefore are no good.
Thank you for considering my comments.
