From: David L. Matson, Ph.D. Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:40 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As a professor at a liberal arts college, I am dismayed at the level of indoctrination represented in this proposed curriculum. The purpose of education is to teach students to think critically, not ideologically. The completely one-sided viewpoint represented in this curriculum does not meet the standard of critical thought. Simply put, what the California Department of Education is proposing is indoctrination of the highest order to be implemented at the lowest orders of our educational system. A student should be exposed to a variety of viewpoints, each treated fairly and as objectively as possible. This curriculum fails miserably at achieving such a pedagogical outcome and should be jettisoned immediately. That the California Department of Education could even entertain such a violation of academic integrity is embarrassing and does not give one confidence that its members even understand what critical thought is.
