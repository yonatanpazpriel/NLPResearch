As a graduate of California public schools, the mother of 3 California graduates, and the grandmother of 6 California graduates, who will use the curriculum in California, I am requesting the removal of BDS and other elements of the proposed curriculum that has clear anti-Israel bias. These things do not promote tolerance and inclusion, but rather encourage division and discrimination. I personally know of a student who was repeatedly, verbally attacked when he tried to voice positive information about Israel in response to anti-Israel material provided by a teacher in a California public school. After repeated attempts by the parents to work with the school to try to provide a balanced approach failed, the parents were forced to remove their son from the school and put him into a private school.

The Glossary description of "BDS" as having the purpose to "establish freedom for Palestinians" ignores the fact that Omar Barghouti, one of the original founders and one of its current leaders of the movement "... has denied the right of the Jewish people in their homeland, saying, `We oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.'" (quoting H.Res. 246, a resolution of the U.S. House of Representatives, passed by 398-17 on 7/23/19). It also ignores the fact that the slogan associated with the BDS movement and frequently chanted at pro-BDS rallies, "From the river to the sea, Palestine shall be free", advocates for the destruction of Israel because in their own words, there is no place for a state of Israel in any part of the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. This page of the sample lesson encourages teachers to positively highlight BDS, but has no information critically analyzing the perspectives provided. This page also promotes a false equivalence between what Israel has to do to stop terrorists from entering residential communities to attack civilians, and the US policies regarding immigration. The words used on this page imply that "Israel-Palestine" is a single, Arab country. This page accepts the Palestinian narrative regarding the 1948 War as fact, without giving any voice to any other perspective, much less a factual, historic assessment of what happened. I have relatives who lived there at the time, as do others, who would be happy to give a different perspective. I also have relatives whose family lived in what is now Israel, for seven generations, and can speak of the historic ties to the land. These pages encourage teachers to use a poem that has harsh criticism of Israel, without offering any different perspectives. I urge you to include additional content that provides positive perspectives of Israel and/or criticism of Palestinian leaders.

The Introduction for the proposed curriculum describes goals "... deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." I would like to respectfully suggest that, especially given the rise of anti-Semitism in our country, this one-sided approach in proposed curriculum will fall far short of its very important goals, and very possibly have the opposite effect. It is entirely possible to promote cultural diversity and inclusion by having positive information about Palestinians without promoting bigotry and hate by not offering alternative perspectives to the Palestinian narrative to the history of Israel and Palestine, and not including positive information about the Jewish people. I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, how many of us have served our country in governmental and other positions, and how some are survivors of the Holocaust, or fled oppression in the Middle East or discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
