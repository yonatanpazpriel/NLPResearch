From: Tami Bollay Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am opposed to the Ethnic Studies curriculum because it discriminates against white males, Christians, Western Civilization and the people of the United States. Not every person was a slave holder in this Nation; Enough of your rudeness, we are tired of paying for this garbage.
