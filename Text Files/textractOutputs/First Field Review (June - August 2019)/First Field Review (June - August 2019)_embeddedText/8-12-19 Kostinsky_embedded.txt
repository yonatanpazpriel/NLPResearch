From: Laura Kostinsky Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 1:16 PM To: CFIRD Subject: Ethnic Studies just the first?
Dear CFIRD Personnel:
It is unsettling that a curriculum such as the current "Ethnic Studies" under consideration could possibly be adopted and even mandated by the state of California. It is imperative that the Department of Education put into place safeguards to ensure that hate indoctrination in any form can never again even be proposed for adoption, or if so, at least swiftly and definitively rejected.
Sincerely, Laura Kostinsky
