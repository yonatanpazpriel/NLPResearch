p. 8 line 172 limiting ethnic studies to the original fields is unnecessarily restrictive. This model curriculum should include all ethnic groups that have a relatively unique history and culture. This limit marginalizes ethnic groups from whom there is much to learn, such as Armenian studies or Jewish studies. The curriculum is almost devoid on offering students analytical tools and practical skills for interactions with diverse ethnic groups. If you've taken an Asian American Studies class how are you better prepared to interact and communicate with an Arab-American?
