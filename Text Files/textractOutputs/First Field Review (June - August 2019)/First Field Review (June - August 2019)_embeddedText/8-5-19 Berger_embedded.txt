General Comment: The Ethnic Studies Curriculum must include consideration of historical and contemporary anti-Semitism.
It should also educate students about the nature and history of the Jewish experience, including the Holocaust as well as the ethnic cleansing of Jews and other minorities from the Middle East.
BDS is a highly politicized and anti-Semitic effort that should not be promoted. It is plain wrong to label Israel as an apartheid state when it is clearly not and when anti-Jewish and anti-Christian apartheid is widely practiced in the Middle East outside of Israel.
The Curriculum should delete all instances of pro-BDS and anti-Israel bias. These elements constitute political indoctrination and thus are opposed to the very purpose of this Curriculum. Problematic pages include page numbers: 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269.
