From: April Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 7:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please don't be anti-Semitic with your program!
I'm a career diversity and inclusion professional. It often floors me when I meet younger generations who either don't believe in or haven't heard about the holocaust. Ethnic studies should highlight the cultures about which they speak, not fall into the same stereotypic tropes that caused the deaths of millions. Jews are one of the smallest minorities in the world, with less than 15 million in the entire world. If we don't protect small minorities from stereotypes, we all lose.
The holocaust is a lesson for us all. Please include it and remove blame and stereotypes of any group. History repeats itself more often than we think. Genocide is happening all over the world. There are enough countries on the world that are holocaust deniers and blame this small minority for their woes in classroom settings. Please don't allow this horrific classroom plan to plague our school system.
By pitting people against one another, you create an environment ripe for immediate and long term bullying.
Thank you for your consideration.
