From: Ellen Liston Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 2:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethics curriculum
It has come to our attention that the proposed ethics curriculum has anti Jewish content. Antisemitism has been a growing threat in California, the entire US and Europe. Please address this in the curriculum. Also, teaching that the bds movement is an appropriate response to the problems in Israel is an ill informed opinion. The problems between Israel and the Palestinians is multi faceted. The best solution would be for economic opportunities between Israel and the Palestinians and the bds movement does just the opposite. Terrorism against Israel and an inability to accept Israel's right to exist is another barrier to peace.
The proposed curriculum presents an inherent danger to Jewish students and Jewish residents in California. It also does an injustice to all students by teaching incorrect information.
Thank you Ellen and Jim Liston Walnut Creek Ca
