Under "In-Class Community Building" it says "Engaging topics on race, class, gender, oppression, etc., may evoke feelings of vulnerability, uneasiness, sadness, or discomfort..." � My feedback � I would not want children to feel these feelings at school over racial topics. I don't think it is appropriate to discuss class, gender, oppression etc. I don't relate class structures to the USA and this class is teaching children to see each other through class, race and other categories which my child currently does not do and I don't want him to start doing, or to feel uneasy or sad or discomfort at school. Under "Essential Questions" it says "1. Who are you/we? And from where did you/we come?" These are questions I would like to teach my child myself and not a 3rd person who doesn't know our background. Under "Key Terms" it includes "Race, Ethnicity, Nationality, Culture, Gender, Sexuality, Community..." I do not want these items discussed in grade school/high school. An adult can choose to enroll in classes that discuss this in college as an alternative. I am not in agreement with gender definition in the curriculum which differs from my religion and do not want it taught in public schools to minors under 18.

In general, I am not in agreement with the curriculum excluding the Armenian race, which makes up a large percentage of ethnic minorities in California. I think my child would feel more excluded for the course to focus on Hispanics, Blacks, Jews, Native Americans, Arabs and Asians and exclude the history of Armenians who have the largest population outside of Armenian in Los Angeles, with a section of the city, Little Armenia, even named after it. Public schools already teach and have holidays for the above for the most part, such as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Cesar Chavez Day and even majors in Black History and Latino Studies. To provide even more information on races children already know about will only make those not in one of the categories, whose history is not studied, feel more isolated and I would not want my child to experience that and be treated like second class minority whose history does not belong in such curriculum. I don't see how teaching sexuality and gender in public school is appropriate or more important than teaching how to balance a check book, take out car and home loans, invest, do laundry and other practical things instead of making children more sexualized and teaching about class and racial differences to segregate and make others feel excluded. I hope these concerns will be taken into consideration to revise the curriculum. Thank you.
