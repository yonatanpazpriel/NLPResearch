Overall comments.
It is strongly biased towards liberal policies and socialism. It in no way paints a balanced view of anything at all. It is anti-capitalism, and anti-democracy. It uses known, convicted criminals, including murderers, as roll models. It defines CRITICAL THINKING in unscientific counter-cultural subjective ideas. It uses uncommon jargon not suitable for classrooms. It teaches protest, violent and disruptive activism vs working within institutions to achieve change It distorts/idealizes the native American activities (Many actually prefer to be called INDIANS) and their relationship and stewardship of land in North America � Ignoring some tribe's routine of burning forested areas to improve hunting and of moving away from their garbage ever so often, damning and draining pools to capture fish, etc.
Does it include the facts about who kills blacks? vs. who kills whites? � most blacks are killed by blacks and whites are killed by whites. Does it include the fact that this happening within the black community can be traced to children born into single parent families and lack of intact families vs. blaming it on whites?
