I am so disappointed. This course content may be good for college age students who already have a sense of their own personal identity and critical thinking skills, but it is FAR from appropriate for high school and younger children. Please start over. Develop an Ethnic Studies program that teaches factual history, even in all it's gruesome details � so that my very smart children can come to their own conclusions about racism and oppression. Please, please do not indoctrinate my children into YOUR belief that they are victims of the system. The sample course content is so leading that children will not be able to think for themselves (One small example � teach them the value of Native American sites (which I fully agree with) then the next step is ask them if it's important to protect those sites. That is blatant brainwashing. It's NOT asking the children to think for themselves! You have told them how THEY must think, not how to reason out their own value system. I am horrified. I definitely want my children to learn about other cultures in our community, to learn from historical wrongs that have been perpetrated. They are smart, they will see the obvious without you forcing it down their throat. With much regret, I can assure you I will refuse to have my children participate in these courses as they are currently proposed.
