Generally speaking I'm opposed to teaching that capitalism is a "form of power and oppression," "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy," and "ableism". The public school system should teach facts, not opinions or ideologies. Rather than demonizing a system that has advanced more people (all ethnic groups) than any other system, instruct the facts about tyranny, socialism (which leads to tyranny), monarchs, etc. The family is responsible for the moral upbringing of children, not the government.
