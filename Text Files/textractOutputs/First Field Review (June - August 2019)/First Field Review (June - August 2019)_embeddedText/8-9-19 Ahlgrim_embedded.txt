Page 2 Line 30-40 "Definition of BDS" is biased and opinionated. It is sadly ironic that this curriculum, which insinuates a purpose of promoting ethnic understanding and tolerance is including items that are divisive and as of August 6, 2019 actually against current United States Government Policy regarding this Anti-Semitic Boycott. On August 6, 2019 H.Res.246 overwhelmingly was passed! 398 members supported the resolution, with 17 voting against it, 16 of them from the Democrats. The American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) posted a statement commending Congress for passing the resolution. "BDS disguises its true intentions under the banner of 'human rights,' yet it hypocritically ignores human rights abuses against Palestinians in other countries across the Middle East, as well as the widespread abuses perpetrated by Palestinian leaders against their own people," the organization tweeted. There is nothing noble about a boycott to discriminate against our democratic ally. We applaud the 350 representatives � 175 Democrats and 175 Republicans � who have co-sponsored H.Res.246 and called BDS what it is: anti-Israel, antipeace and damaging to U.S. interests." Therefore this particular Glossary Entry among other items, which are being searched out, reveal the underlying agenda of this curriculum to be Biased & Possibly Treasonous.
