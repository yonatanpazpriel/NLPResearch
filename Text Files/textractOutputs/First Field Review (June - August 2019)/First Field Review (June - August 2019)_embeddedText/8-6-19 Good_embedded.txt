Dear Madams and Sirs:

Although not a resident of California, I write to express my grave concerns about the concepts and the details of the Ethnic Studies curriculum proposed by the Commission. It appears to have the purpose not to inspire students toward overcoming racial or ethnic disadvantage through a diligent hard work effort in learning, but rather to incite them toward a spirit of anger and revolution. It might in fact teach them that simply because they are black, Latino, indigenous, female or trans that they are entitled.

The role models listed for biographical study include Angela Davis, Bobby Seale, Mumia Abu-Jamal, Oscar Lopez Rivera, Lolita Lebron and others who engaged in criminal activities or were in fact convicted. To me, this is evidence of your critical misdirection in this important responsibility to inspire the students about how to lift themselves up.

Reading your glossary depressed me greatly. You colored your definitions, (take "capitalism" or "whiteness" as examples), with negative language that seeks to plant evil seeds in the students' brains, rather than allowing them to study, observe, and come to their own conclusions.

I will contact as many of my California friends as I can in the next week or so to suggest they read your proposed curriculum and give feedback. And I'll pray that socialistic thinking such as this does not take root in California or anywhere else in this great country of ours.

Thank you for letting me express my opinion. Please go back to the drawing board. Sincerely, Larry Good
