Page 1 OMITS the term "anti-semitism" while Page 2 (starting at line 30) expounds about "BDS" Page 269 (line 5803) alludes to Jewish control of the media, one of the most virulent anti-Semitic canards.
This course is supposed to celebrate the various ethnic groups that form our rainbow of diversity. Jews have a long, storied history of positive contributions to the ethnic mix of our community. However, not only does the curriculum seek to hide these positive contributions, it makes no mention of the anti-semitism that has plagued the Jewish community; in fact, it perpetuates anti-semitic tropes and stereotypes!
