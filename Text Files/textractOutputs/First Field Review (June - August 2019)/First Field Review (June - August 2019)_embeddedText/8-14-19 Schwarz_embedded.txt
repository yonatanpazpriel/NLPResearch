From: Eitan Schwarz MD Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum erases the Jewish experience.
Your proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum erases the Jewish experience. � Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. It is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. � The ESMC covers a wide variety of forms of bigotry but omits antisemitism. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement and casts some of its promoters as role models.
