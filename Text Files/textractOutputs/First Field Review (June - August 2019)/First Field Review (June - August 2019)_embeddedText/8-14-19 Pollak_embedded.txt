To whom it may concern:
I am a parent of children in California public schools as well as a California public school graduate.
My husband and I were dismayed to learn of the draft ESMC which grossly misconstrues, simplifies and omits key aspects of very nuanced and complicated issues. Troubling aspects of the draft ESMC include, but are not limited to: the exclusion of Jews or mention of antiSemitism; extreme anti-Israel content, including support for BDS; and the use of negative Jewish stereotypes.
I would not allow my children to take such a course and I am disappointed that curricula promoting hate and intolerance would be considered for public instruction in California.
I urge you to reconsider the draft ESMC and consult with the appropriate stakeholders to remedy these issues.
Sincerely, Darya Pollak
