Chapter 2, Pages 234: The course "Arab American Studies" includes a topic "Comparative Border Studies: Mexico and Palestine" that promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.
Chapter 2, Pages 234-235: The course "Arab American Studies" proposes to cover "Significant Figures" that include figures such as Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar who are among the most antiIsrael figures in U.S. public life. There are no Arab Americans listed who are from the American Muslim Reform movement, which is a socially progressive movement of Arab Americans that promotes a more peaceful and tolerant Arab American identity, one that seeks to collaborate with Jewish Americans and does not demonize or delegitimize Jews or the State of Israel. Chapter 2, Page 242: Use and definition of "Nakba" frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspective. This entire chapter is in itself anti-Semitic. In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture" � a classic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews control the media. Chapter 2 and the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum single out Israel � the only Jewish state in the world � for special criticism and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate. Holding Israel up to unique, inaccurate and unfair criticism and double standards has been defined by the U.S. State Department as a form of anti-Semitism.

p. 234: Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives p. 234: Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico p. 237: Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country p.242: Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives p.256, 264-269: Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public - a common anti-Semitic slur Page 2, Lines 30-40. The definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel describes it as a "social movement." The definition then parrots BDS talking points such as describing Palestinians as "living under apartheid conditions." BDS is actually a political ideology, which has been outlawed in at least 22 States and a U.S. congressional bill is pending to condemn it. The glossary offers no critical perspectives about BDS, which falsely characterizes Israel as a criminal state and delegitimizes the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination. Permitting students to study BDS as a "social movement" with these talking points will be divisive and will undermine peaceful discussion about the Palestinian-Israel conflict. Page 10, Lines 239-240: The Glossary contains the definition of the term "Islamophobia" as "hatred, discrimination, fear, and prejudice against Muslims and the overall religion of Islam," but the Glossary does not contain a definition of "anti-Semitism." Anti-Semitism is the #1 incident of religious-based hate crime in the United States. The omission of the term "anti-Semitism" from the Glossary is itself antiSemitic because the omission bespeaks the authors' failure to consider Jews as a minority ethnicity that is also the frequent target of bigotry, hatred and violence. At a minimum, the Glossary should define antiSemitism just like Islamophobia: "hatred, discrimination, fear and prejudice against Jews and the Jewish religion" The definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and anti-Semitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others. I strongly urge you to remove anti-Semitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum.
