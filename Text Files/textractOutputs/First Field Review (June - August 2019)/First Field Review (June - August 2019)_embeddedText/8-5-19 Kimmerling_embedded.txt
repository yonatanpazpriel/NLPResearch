To: Dept. of Education, State of California Re: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing today as a citizen of this country, a resident of this state over the past 45 years, and a university instructor at San Francisco State University, Graduate College of Education, for the past 25 years. I am floored at the proposals made for the Ethnic Studies curriculum for our future students.
Specifically, the curriculum proposes to " enable students to develop a deeper appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion... and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." These are noble goals, poorly implemented in this curriculum.
There is not a single lesson about the Jewish community.
There is no discussion of the history of anti-Semitism and eradication of Jews from several countries in the Middle East before and during the establishment of the state of Israel. The highly controversial BDS movement is one that is promoted in the curriculum, with no information critical of this perspective for children and educators to contemplate.
Promotion of a false equivalent of Israel's efforts to stop terrorists at its borders with US policies at the border of Mexico is a charged and inappropriate analogy.
On p. 237 the curriculum discusses "Israel-Palestine", which does not exist, as an Arab country.
Discusses the 1948 War of Independence entirely through the Palestinian perspective as the "naquba". (P. 242)
On P. 256, 264-269 presents a poem with harsh criticism of Israel but no content offering a positive perspective of Israel or criticism of Palestinian leadership.
I would love to have a response from you on these issues. Please reconsider this highly charge, biased curriculum, which is, in fact, based on emotions rather than fact. Sincerely,
Flo Kimmerling ED.M., M.S., SLP-CCC Lecturer in the Dept. of Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences
