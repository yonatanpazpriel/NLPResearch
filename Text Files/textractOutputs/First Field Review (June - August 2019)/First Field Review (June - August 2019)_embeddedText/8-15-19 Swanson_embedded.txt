The entire curriculum is extremely biased against Israel and reads as if it has been prepared pro-Palestinian activists (CAIR?) rather than unbiased historians. If the conflict between Jews and Israel and the so-called Palestinians is to be covered it must be honest about the historical context (i.e. Jews have lived continuously in the Middle East and what is now Israel, Jordan, and the territories for over 3000 years, and therefore have every right to consider it their homeland. Also for decades before the establishment of the State of Israel by the UN in 1948 Arab residents in these areas carried out multiple pogroms against the Jews there murdering them. For example please see the Hebron massacre). Also any curriculum about the so-called Palestinians should cover their long history of terrorism against Israelis, Americans and other Westerners. Does the curriculum point out that after Israel voluntarily withdrew from the Gaza strip (which has therefore not been ``occupied`` since 2005) Hamas was voted into power, and Hamas is designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.

The curriculum does not appear to include lessons about the history of Jews in the Middle East where Arabs come from. For hundreds of years (Until the reestablishment of Israel in 1948) Jews were persecuted by Arabs in Middle East

and then forced from their homes post 1948. Where is this history?
The term BDS is defined as a ``movement to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions``. This is false! So-called Palestinians have been offered terms for their own state by Israel multiple times and have refused each time � since their leaders` goal is to destroy Israel rather than co-exist with it. The BDS movement is a tool employed by Israel haters to try and destroy Israel. Stating that Israel imposes apartheid on Palestinians and does not comply with International law as facts is very misleading � these are opinions held by pro-Palestinian activists and should NOT be presented as facts. Are you aware that the vast majority of Muslims living in Israel are happy to live in Israel and do not want to live in an Arab or Palestinian country? Does this sound like an apartheid state? ``The Muslim Ban Executive Order 13769`` -- there was no such Muslim ban, this is clearly a term used by Muslim activists and is not only inaccurate it is highly offensive. A travel ban was applied to certain countries from which potential terrorists might travel. The vast majority of majority-Muslim countries � including for example Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, etc � were not included so it could not possibly be a ``Muslim ban``!

Also there is no mention at all as a possible topic Arab terrorism against the West over the last 50 years! Not even 9/11!

Finally the ``Call to BDS Israel`` is clearly a topic designed to incite hatred for Israel. This is inappropriate and biased. On page 237 the term ``Israel-Palestine`` is used, which implies that ALL of Israel equates with so-called Palestine. I.E. it implies that Israel in its entirety could (should?) be claimed by the Palestinians as their land. This simple term implies therefore that ALL of Israel is contested and perhaps should be Palestinian. This logically leads to the idea that Israel perhaps should be

On page 242 the term Nakba is used and defined, which is a biased term used to defame Israel, while no mention is made of the hundreds of thousands of Jews who were displaced from nearby middle eastern Arabs lands and forced to emigrate elsewhere (many of whom sought refuge in Israel). Again, the terms are biased and the narrative is extremely one-sided. Obviously written by Palestinian activists (CAIR?) Shadia Mansour is said to come from ``Palestine``. No such country exists. Can you outline its borders?
