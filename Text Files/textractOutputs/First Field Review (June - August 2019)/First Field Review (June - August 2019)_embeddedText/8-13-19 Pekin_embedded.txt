I am adamantly opposed to the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum(brainwashing) of California students. Reading a proposed example on your website incites racism. Examples of privilege of white, Asian, Hispanic and Black in the manner given creates anger and hatred. Also, it s very anti white. Quoting Ocazio Cortez, looking up articles in the New York Times, confirm that differing perspectives will NOT be presented. The Left agenda is indoctrination of the youth, starting as early as possible. Only negative references to the Jewish perspective of the Palistinian situation is also shocking. Where is the even handed, fair perspective. What kind of B.S is it that history is now hxrstory, Herstory? The left has taken this crap too far. Why are all the subjects about how minorities has been abused , taken advantage of? Why is it the educational systems right to make children sit through garbage information in order to graduate? I have had 3 children go through the Cal State, and UC systems. In order to graduate, they were required to take quite a few cultural indoctrination classes ant thousands of dollars of expense in order to graduate. Same agenda, always who the white oppressor has kept Down. Well the left is winning, divide and make sure every is aggrieved about everything. Everything is an insult, an aggression or racist. Your educational system has created the hate politics that you scream about despising. Look in the mirror and at the curriculum and make some changes . This is hateful propaganda. Your agenda only convinces me more each day how thankful that my kids are grown, otherwise it would only be Charter, private or home schooling. Carla Pekin
