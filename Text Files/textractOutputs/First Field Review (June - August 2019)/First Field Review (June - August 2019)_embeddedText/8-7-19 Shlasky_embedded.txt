From: Stephanie Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 3:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I was shocked to read about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Jews have made significant contributions to the State of California in every area despite the fact that the Jewish community has often had to deal with bigotry, discrimination, and hatred.
And yet, the proposed ESMC completely erases the Jewish experience. Not only is this offensive, but it is also inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies, which should be designed to promote understanding that will hopefully lead to inclusion and tolerance.
Even as antisemitism is increasing in America, especially on college campuses, the proposed ESMC totally ignores Jewish Americans, which means that the entire issue of antisemitism is completely ignored by the curriculum.
Ironically, the focus on Arab Americans and the issue of Islamophobia makes it appear as if antisemitism is a minor problem, easily ignored, while recent FBI statistics reflect over 900 anti-Semitic incidents in comparison with less than 300 incidents of Islamophobia.
Even worse than all of that, the proposed ESMC not only ignores the positive contributions of Jewish Americans to the United States in general and, more specifically, to California, as well as their struggles with antisemitism, it proceeds to denigrate them and support the BDS Movement, which is not only anti-Israel, but is also anti-Semitic, given that the leaders of the BDS Movement have clearly stated that they wish to destroy the State of Israel.
While I'm sure that the idea of an Ethnic Studies Curriculum was well intended by former Governor Brown, I cannot believe that he ever envisioned anything like what is being proposed in the current version of the ESMC.
