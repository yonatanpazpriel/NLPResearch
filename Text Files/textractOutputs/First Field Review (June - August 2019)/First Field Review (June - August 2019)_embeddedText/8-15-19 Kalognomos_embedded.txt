The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is a profound example of respect, acceptance and acknowledgement for the ethnic mosaic that is the fiber of our nation. I would like to express my gratitude to you for your leadership on this issue.
However, some ethnic groups such as the Armenians are omitted from the curriculum. The Armenian immigrants and their contributions are part of our nation's history which spans for over 400 years starting with Martin the Armenian in Virginia in 1618, to Governor George Deukmejian in 1983, to Reddit's Alexis Ohanian in 2019.
Their story which includes many waves of immigration due to discrimination, persecution, massacres, and genocide should be included in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum as well as their most positive contributions to our country as productive and loyal citizens.
At the present, a large number of Armenian students attend Los Angeles, Glendale and Pasadena Unified Scholl Districts. They deserve to have their story told and a rightful place in the development and history of their country.
As educational leaders we must rise above all issues of political pressures and teach history truthfully and inclusively to the future generations.
Thank you for the opportunity to share our thoughts with you and thank you for your consideration.
