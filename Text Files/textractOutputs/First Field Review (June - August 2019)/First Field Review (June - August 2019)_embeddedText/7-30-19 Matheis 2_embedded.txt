These comments are in addition to my comments previously filed earlier today:
I would like to add that the popular culture and academia today seeks to pretend there has been no progress since the Enlightenment in the world, specifically in the United States. A civil war was fought in which 500,000 people perished, to abolish slavery. The first black person was elected to Congress in 1870, the first black senator, in 1875. The first woman, in 1917, over 100 years ago. It is interesting to note that all these "firsts" were Republicans, because the popular belief, being taught in the schools, I might add, are that between the two popular political parties in the U.S., the Democrats are supposedly more "progressive."

I could go on listing the "firsts," which mostly all happened before I was born. The first woman LAPD officer served and retired before I was born, 62 years ago. You wouldn't know it from the popular media and academia. Deeds, not words. Facts, not fiction. That is what needs to be taught.

The denial of the progress in this country, in terms of ethnic rights (and in all other areas of the society, like science, medicine, technology, etc.) that is being taught to children appears to be an intentional act to sow discord and dissent in the society. It is reminiscent of the cultural revolution in China during the Mao era. That would also be a good thing to teach children about.
