This program is completely unacceptable in my opinion. It tells the students that you Conservative opinion is not an option to the think of this program. Shouldn't the student have an opportunity to choose. Not everyone is as Liberal as this program suggests and envision life in general. Those who have been quoted and supported spew their experiences and want to lead others into their motives. Jerry Brown is a man who would do anything for anyone so that he could be in the limelight and receive "kudos" just as Gavin Newton is continuing to do. These two liberal leaders are Capitalists who achieved their fortunes but do not represent (at least myself) all thinking's and I feel sorry for the generations to come and to see this world destroyed by hatred.
