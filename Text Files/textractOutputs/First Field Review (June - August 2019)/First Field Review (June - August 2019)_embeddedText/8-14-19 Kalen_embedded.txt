I have read the depiction of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict and find it completely biased. When the United Nations established the State of Israel in 1948, all her Arab neighbors attacked. She won. If you want to mention the BDS movement , you should also mention the eviction of Jews from Syria, Iraq, Iran and other nations hostile to the Jewish people.
Furthermore, eliminating Jewish antisemitism in the wake of recent hate crimes in Newport Beach, murders in San Diego and other atrocities is appalling. My own children were taunted in High School.
Who wrote this? Please use common sense and eliminate these falsifications. Jews have contributed greatly to California and its history.
Would you penalize all Chinese because of the current crackdown in Hong Kong of pro-democracy protesters or its intolerance of Muslims ?
Let's be fair and honest when it comes to our children's education!
