From: Joanna Medin Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 12:35 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC Curriculum cannot be passed as is
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am extremely concerned by the proposed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
� This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses.
� The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religiousbased hate crimes in the United States.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. I grew up being bullied because of my religious upbringing and it's imperative that Jews are being represented through equality and fairness. I implore you to include some of the Jewish leaders in the discussion and farming of the anti-Semitic realities throughout the world.
Thank you,
Joanna Medin
