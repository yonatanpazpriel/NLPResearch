Dear Ms. Chao,
I am a life-long resident of the State of California and a complete product of the public school system and the University of California. I am writing to express my grave concern about the proposed current draft of the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. It is misleading and inaccurate in several critical respects.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, (my maternal grandmother was born in San Francisco on 1906), culture, business and politics-- as well as our longstanding struggle against bigotry and hatred--the model curriculum dismisses the American Jewish experience (pp. 48, 200, 233-4, 236).
The draft singles out Israel for approbation (Chapter 2, P. 105). It recommends song lyrics. It omits anti-Israel themes. It ignores the blatant and dangerous anti-Semitic tendencies of today's racists (Chapter 2, p. 270).
California has always prided itself on diversity and acceptance. It would be appalling to single out a single religious group for persecution in its curricula.
Please consider this letter in your deliberations. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Sheri Rosenblum
P.S. I am a Holocaust Educator who dedicates every day of my life to empowering young people to speak out early and stand up against antisemitism, hatred, and oppression. It would certainly be a crime if the State of CA has to be highlighted as a perpetrator of this intolerance
