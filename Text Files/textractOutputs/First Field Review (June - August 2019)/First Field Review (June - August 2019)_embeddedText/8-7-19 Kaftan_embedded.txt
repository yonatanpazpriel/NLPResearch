As a member of the Jewish faith and an American citizen I am both shocked and appalled at the proposed curriculum, especially with regard to the promotion of BDS against the State of Israel. The curriculum proposal has been clearly created by those with a political and ideological bent against Israel and Jews in general. I find the language, and concepts both fundamentally anti-Semitic and racist even beyond the pall of of the venom spewed by Donald Trump.
