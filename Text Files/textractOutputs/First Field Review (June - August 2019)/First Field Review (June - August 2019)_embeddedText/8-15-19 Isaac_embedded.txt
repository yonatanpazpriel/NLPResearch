I come from a school where we have two Jewish clubs on campus. We are lucky enough to have a strong community of Jews, and it is not uncommon to hear of a friend celebrating the Sabbath on a Friday night. We have a plethora of Jewish kids, but antisemitism remains an issue. Antisemitic "jokes" and comments are all too common. Nearby schools have been emblazoned in spray-painted swastikas and racist posters. I am 16 years old, going into my junior year of high school, and will likely be directly affected very little by curriculum changes that happen within the next 2 years. That being said, the power of education on young minds is profound and the youth of California take strongly after their schooling. If their textbooks cannot define antisemitism, they will not be able to either. If their teachers may only educate on one side of a complex issue, they will be restricted to that point of view. It is of paramount importance to young minds to do them the service of opening and expanding their minds rather than putting them through a factory conveyer belt. Give kids the opportunity to think for themself by encouraging them to challenge their viewpoint and long-held beliefs. It's their right.
