From: Manuel Sent: Saturday, August 3, 2019 9:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
I skimmed through the document. The content of politically correct language, Marxist ideology and dense rhetoric makes the curriculum useless for objective scholastics. To think that $12,000 per student per year is used for propaganda indoctrination instead of thoughtful teaching somehow explains the poor state of student achievement. Who writes this drivel? How much do you pay him/her/it? The Chinese and Indian students don't endure this nonsense and consequently are better qualified for the jobs of the future, while the California students will be only able to say, "do you want fries with that" in Spanish and Swahili.
