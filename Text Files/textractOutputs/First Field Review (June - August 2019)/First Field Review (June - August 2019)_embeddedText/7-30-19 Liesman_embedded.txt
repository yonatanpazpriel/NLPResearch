From: Andrea Liesman Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 4:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Banning Ethnic Studies
To Whom This May Concern:
This email is to express my concern that ethnic studies will be brought in to the classroom at the elementary, middle school, or high school level. These classes have no choice but to be riddled with the opinion of the person teaching the class. It is not up to the school district to define student views taught in ethnic studies. There are currently plenty of history books that capture this instruction. The best example is the Constitution of The United States, after this the history of slavery, Jim Crow, women's right to vote, and the history of the equal rights amendment.
It is redundant to adopt an ethnic studies platform. Students struggle to understand the basics as it is, such as the branches of government and what they do, the electoral college and why we have it, the Constitution of the United States, general history from Reconstruction forward, to name just a few. This doesn't even cover reading concepts, writing, and math. Class time has already become less and less for teachers to teach the curriculum they have effectively since schools have become so test centered.
Not to mention, Women's studies at the College level is a load of garbage, and much of what is taught is the feminist agenda rather than true facts of the subject, and the class is attended by mostly other women. At the elementary, middle, and high school level students have not developed enough critical thinking to introduce this kind of subjective curriculum in the classroom. This kind of curriculum brought in to the schools makes a strong argument in favor of private school, and home school.
I urge you to NOT bring ethnic studies into the classroom.
Warm Regards, Andrea
