I was horrified to read about your new ethnic study class that you were presenting August completely vilified Israel.Why was Israel singled out?WhT about Saudi Arabia and it's policy with women. This is not supposed to be about other countries. It's supposed to be about tolerance and understanding your fellow human beings.Jews have always been in the forefront of helping and giving to those around them .Financially as well as physically. This sounds so Betsy de vos.This is not Calif.
