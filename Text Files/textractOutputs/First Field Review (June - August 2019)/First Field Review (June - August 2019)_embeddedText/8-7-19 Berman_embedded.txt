30 Boycott, Divestment and Sancfions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently 31 aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. lnspired by 32 tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led 33 movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the lsraeli government 34 until it complies with lnternational law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for 35 the global community to boycott or withdraw support from lsrael and companies 36 associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, 37 universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from lsrael 38 and its companies. And finally, the third component-sanctions-asks international 39 governments to hold lsrael accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and 40 military agreements, among other measures.

42 Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on 43 a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. 44 Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of ciapritalism as 45 research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately 46 exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated 47 from human labor and everything is commodified.
48 Character- A combination of qualities (i.e. mental, moral, ethical, etc.) that render a 49 person distinctly unique.
50 Chicana/o/x- A contested social and political identity chosen by people living in the 51 United States with Mexican and indigenous ancestry. The term with the 'x' is 52 pronounced with an '-ex' sound at the end of the word.

Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as "Arab," (e.9. predominantly Arabicspeaking, member of the Arab League). lf time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, lsrael-Palestine, and lraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US.

5145 The influx of immigrants from outside Western Europe in the late nineteenth century 5146 provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, 5147 who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of 5148 American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal 5149 and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western 5150 European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the 5151 passage of the lmmigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply 5152 restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs 5153 were allowed to immigrate each year.
5154 The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more 5155 slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was srnaller (less 5156 than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. lmmigrants both Christian 5157 and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group 5158 was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the 5159 Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and 5160 dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of lsrael in the 1948 Palestine 5161 War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, 5162 were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those 5163 without wealth or a trade.
5164 Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising 5165 as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and 5166 considered their Arab identity politically central. The term "Arab" is generally used to 5167 mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone 5168 who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.

The lmmigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. l-he Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. lraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

Day 2: Teacher distributes song lyrics to the song, "Somos Sur" by Ana Tijoux and Shadia Mansour. Teacher introduces the song by explaining that:
"Somos Sur" is a song off Ana Tijoux's latest album "Vengo". She collaborated on this song with Shadia Mansour, who is an Arab hip-hop artist from Palestine. Ana is from Chile, where her parents were exiled under the dictatorship of Pinochet a few years before she was born in France.

o While the video plays, try and follow along with the lyrics
o Underline 3 lines that stand out to you-either in English, Spanish, or Arabic
o Ana Tijoux is quoted as saying, "l feel that music is an amazing weapon,
an amazing tool, like to have this reflection with the world. lt's a conversation, a dialogue with the world."
o Using this song and your own personal experience with music, explain
how music can be used as a weapon and how it can be used to give people agency?
