I have reviewed some but not all of the course material and am very concerned with the politicized slant of the course work especially of the Arab-American experience. Specific instances of this politicized slant are included in the specific statements below. In general, though, as listed after Line 61, "Sample Key Concepts of This Course," 70 ideology, 72 intergenerational trauma and healing, 75 race/racisim, 76 White supremacy, and 77 Xenophobia. It should be obvious to an unbiased, objective observer, that the ethnic American community, known as Jews, have also experienced the above "Key Concepts", if not more. The ethnic studies course omits the Jewish experience and our country's history of antisemitism. The Jewish culture is a critical part of the ethnic fabric of America, and the experience of Xenophobia, anti-semitism, the specter of White Supremacy and its implications form a dark stain on our country's narrative. I am acutely aware of how misrepresentation in our history books decreases compassion and creates a cycle of bias and intolerance. Absence of balanced historical information is a self-evident bias.

As an example of a biased, a-historical presentation, these lines link Israel/Palestine as if they were the same country. Israel is a recognized country and should be treated as such. One doesn't list Mexico/US because of the 1848 Mexican-American War, or Iraq/Kuwait because of Iraq's invasion tand takeover of Kuwait.

These lines discuss the Johnson-Reed act a if only Arab immigrants were affected. Many other ethnic groups were also affected. Statements of fact may be true, but the manner in which they are presented affects the lessons drawn from them. Leaving out information is the suppressing information
