Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum:
� A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to

I am the daughter of a Holocaust survivor and the decendent of Holocaust murder victims.

I understand that the State of California is currently reviewing a model ethnic studies curriculum which promotes boycotts of Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. While it is supposed to be focused on marginalized communities, the text says nothing about antisemitism, the long history of bigotry directed at Jews within and outside the United States and the fact that Jews continue to be a frequent target of racism � in fact more than any other religious group in the United States (and worldwide). I am appalled by this omission and urge you to fix this immediately,

I also believe that BDS promotes hate and division and fails to recognize that the Jewish people have been targets of hate in most countries where they resided when they had no homeland. My own ancestors were victims of the Inquisition in Spain and the holocaust, as well as pogroms in Russia. Countless relatives were murdered at the hands of the Nazis. Your failure to address Jews as a religious minority that has been discriminated against throughout time is wrong and should be remedied.

end Israel's existence.
� The sample lesson plans for the curriculum: � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop

terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). � Use unclear language that implies "IsraelPalestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). � Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative

perspectives (p. 242). � Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264269).
� The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an

opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this
