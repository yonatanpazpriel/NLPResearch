From: Al Geller Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:28 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: FW: Proposed Ethnic Studies program
The criteria proposed for the Ethnic Studies program emphasizing the "BDS" campaign is not education but a politicizing format. Ethnic Studies should be about understanding different cultures and customs in a non-critical manner so that a deeper understanding of people's backgrounds and beliefs can result in acceptance between the ethnicities. Promoting ethnic differences in a biased format will not create the harmony which this nation sorely needs. I object to the current program which promotes the BDS talking points which is merely an Anti-Semitic cover-up. I hope that the CDE will revise the program so that it will create true understanding and acceptance of different cultures. Alvin Geller, Ventura, Ca.
