As a parent, a teacher and tax payer, I am appalled by the currently proposed model ethnic studies curriculum. It omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, it uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, it glorifies BDS, and it is blatantly anti-Israel.
I urge to establish safeguards to ensure that the curriculum writers are prohibited from hijacking it to promote their own hateful political agendas.
