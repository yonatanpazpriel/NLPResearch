Regarding the Ethnic Studies Curriculum
The authors of the curriculum very well must be aware that when you provide young minds with only one point of view, they will be converts to that view for life. All dictators know that and have made good use of it throughout the years. Yes, Muslims are the subject of hateful rhetoric, but not more so than Jews. A mosque was attacked in New Zealand, but synagogues have been attacked in the U.S. and throughout the world. You label the 1948 war in the Middle East as the Palestinian War. Why don't you provide both sides of the story including the refusal of the Arab countries to accept the U.N. Partition? Why don't you include the internecine wars between the Shia and Sunni Muslims as the reason for an increase in immigration? Yes there are two sides of every conflict. However, for whatever reason, you have decided that only one side is right and you are expecting taxpayers to support your side.
