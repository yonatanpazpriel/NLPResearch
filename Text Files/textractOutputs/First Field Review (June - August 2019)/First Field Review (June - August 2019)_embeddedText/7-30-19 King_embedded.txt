California is turning into a third world entity. The disgusting streets of the cities, the incompetent forest management responsible for destructive wild-fires, the wasted money from tax-payers, the terrible test results in our public schools, I could go on and on.
But bureaucrats controlled by the leftist teachers union have the time and gall to consider brain-washing students to become community organizers in the footsteps of the worst president since James Buchanon. The CDE is so self-unaware, you don't realize Americans think you are kooks. Oh, well. I put in my 2 cents. Proceed with your destructive goals. It worked so well in Cuba and Venezuela.
