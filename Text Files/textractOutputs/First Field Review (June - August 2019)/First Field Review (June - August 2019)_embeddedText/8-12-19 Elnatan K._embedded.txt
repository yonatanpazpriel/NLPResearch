On Page: 22 Lines: 30-40, BDS is described as a "social movement" that aims "to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It gives no mention to the fact that this movement is one of hate and only exists to end Israel's existence. Furthermore, the introduction to the proposed curriculum states: "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." BDS does not "eradicate" hate and create peace. Please remove this bias information from the curriculum.

Page: 234 Line: 4957 mentions that teachers should highlight BDS and the Direct Action for Palestine group but fails to give over the proper notion of disapproval of them. Page: 234 Line 4958 compares stopping murderous terrorists from entering Israel to the U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Please exclude this comparison, as it is not parallel. Page: 237 Line: 5030 refers to the state of Israel as "Israel-Palestine" which implies as a whole it is an Arab country. Please change it to "Israel". Page: 242 Lines: 5154-5163 indicates the Palestinian narrative of the war of 1948 is a fact and does not offer any alternative perspectives. Please change accordingly. Pages: 256, 264-269 encourage teachers to use a poem that criticizes Israel harshly and does not put a positive perspective about Israel. Please change the poem appropriately.

As mentioned above, the introduction states: "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." With antisemitism rising, the lack of education about the Jews only worsens it. It causes children to become ignorant to what Jews are really about and only learn from the anti-Semitic information they are fed from the web and the world around them. If the goal is to develop a "deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion", as stated above, and minimize antisemitism, then students should be educated properly about the history and culture of the Jews. This will generate a better educated society and therefore meet the goals of improving the public school curriculum. As a high school graduate, this curriculum will have a direct impact on my future. If children are taught at a young age about BDS and other anti-Israel material, they will lead anti-Semitic lives. The society that will be surrounding me in the future is depended on this curriculum.
