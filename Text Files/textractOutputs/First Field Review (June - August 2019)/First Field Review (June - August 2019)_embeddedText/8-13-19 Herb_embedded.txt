Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am Zachary Herb and concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a constituent and product of California public school system, I take great pride in supporting efforts that are inclusive and provide for full scope of teachings to future generations of all backgrounds. It is your responsibility to ensure that you include all aspects of disenfranchised groups to include those about Jews and Anti-Semitism.
As a combat veteran and a member of the Jewish community, I ask that you heed these recommendations and ensure the trust and responsibility which has been placed in your organization to make these changes. You are doing a tremendous disservice and undermining all underrepresented groups by leaving out topics about Anti-Semitism and Jews being excluded from any of the ethnic groups mentioned. I was proud to stand for my country when I was called upon. You're in a position to make a change and a difference and I hope you do. I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Zachary Herb
