From: JOEL RINGOLD Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:13 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Strongly urge removing what is obviously anti-Semitic and anti-Israel language from the proposed curriculum. In a time of increasing anti-Semitism around the world your committee should not become associated with this evil. Please do the responsible thing and reject attempts by groups with an agenda to portray Jews in an negative light.
Joel Ringold,MD
