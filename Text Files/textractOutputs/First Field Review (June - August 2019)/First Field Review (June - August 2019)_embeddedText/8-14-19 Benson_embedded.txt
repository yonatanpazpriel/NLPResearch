As legal residents of Los Angeles and California for over 25 years and parents of two high school Juniors, We are deeply troubled by the omission of any meaningful teaching of anti-Semitism. With the escalation in anti-Semitism including shootings at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburg and the Chabad in Poway in our own state of California as well as Nazis openly marching and chanting in Charlottesville "Jews will not replace us", we are quite shocked that the proposed curriculum excludes teaching about antiSemitism including the definition of anti-Semitism.
Please see attached high-level comments to the proposed Ethnic Studies course. Thank you for your consideration. Barri and Michael Benson
