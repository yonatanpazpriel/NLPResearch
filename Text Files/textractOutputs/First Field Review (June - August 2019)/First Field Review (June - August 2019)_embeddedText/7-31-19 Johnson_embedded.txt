Good afternoon,
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include accurate history, cultures, contributions, perspectives, and experiences of groups that have been overlooked, historically marginalized, and often subjected to inaccuracies and invisibility within mainstream courses.
It should provide an opportunity for those being educated to cultivate and advance accurate racial/cultural/community relevant realisms that motivate, support, strengthen, and bolster interrelationships, helping students to better connect with each other, thereby creating a more cohesive unification for future generations.
For instance, Black (African-American) history should include truths pertaining to the Transatlantic and International slave trade, e.g., seventeen million slaves were slaughtered throughout the duration of slavery, not including 1.8 million who died in transit, and 4 million who died while still in Africa. Furthermore, it should include educational information regarding, black scientists, inventors, trailblazers, writers, poets, music, etc., as well as the reason for and structure of Black (African-American) English, i.e. Ebonics, not hip-hop or rap, as a distinct dialect of American English, and a language in its own right.
There are excellent tools, including lessons, activities, and information for teaching black history at https://www.teachercertificationdegrees.com/resources/teaching-black-history/, which could be used in the course model.
Thank you for allowing me to send feedback for the educational model. Jacquelyn Johnson
