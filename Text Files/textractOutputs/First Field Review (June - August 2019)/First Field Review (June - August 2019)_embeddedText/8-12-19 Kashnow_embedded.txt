I urge you to immediately establish safeguards for ensuring that the
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Earlier this month, I learned of a new proposed model ethnic studies curriculum that is antisemitic and anti-Israel. It omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel. This curriculum is intended to be used in all California public high schools, and, if a pending bill (AB 331) is approved by the California legislature, all students will be required to take at least one course based on this curriculum to graduate.
While fixing the curriculum is critical, I believe that the California Department of Education must first establish safeguards to ensure that the curriculum writers are prohibited from hijacking the curriculum to promote their own hateful political agendas. An educational curriculum must not be used as an antisemitic or anti-Israel tool to indoctrinate students and promote hate against any race, religion, individual or group.
