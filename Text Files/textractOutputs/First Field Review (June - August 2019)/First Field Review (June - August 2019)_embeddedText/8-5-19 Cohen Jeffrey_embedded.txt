Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Specifically page 2 of the Glossary document pertaining to BDS. The wording alone of this particular paragraph does not paint a fair picture of the goals of the BDS Movement. In reality, the BDS movement is anti-Israel and anti-semetic. The implication is that Israel is the attacker of the Palestinian people and that those people are innocent. After a small amount of research it is easy to learn that this is far from a one-sided conversation. It is against our democratic ideals and values to remove the ability of people to have discussions on important topics, but this movement seeks to do just that. It is not in line with the values of the great State of California. If there must be a portion of the curriculum that discusses the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, I would urge the Commission to consider adding a portion of the course related to American Jewry as an ethnic group, specifically those who fled the horrors of the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and many other countries such as the USSR.
