The model curriculum is an extreme, radical, far left leaning document. It is an extreme political agenda being presented under the thinly veiled title "ethnic studies program." This program exposes our children to divisive bigotry of the extreme left and needs to be entirely rewritten.

The guidelines call for developing the model curriculum to "be inclusive, creating space for all students regardless of race, class, gender, sexuality, or citizenship."
Far from inclusive, it criticizes capitalism, exalts social justice, develops new language to recreate the English language that is highly offensive to traditional Judeo-Christian values, terms that marginalize Jewish and Christians, pushing
the LBGTQ agenda on parents, educators, and children, marginalizes white people by creating guilt of being people of "privilege" and using a highly offensive and stereotype for white people under the definition of "whiteness." By creating a large glossary of terms recreating traditionally defined terms, it leaves no room for disagreement, but rather sets the table for a new form of discrimination against traditional Judeo-Christian values. All races, ethnicities, within America should be given an opportunity to bring forth its own
unique perspective and be inclusive of these perspectives.

This document as written will result in people removing their children from the public school system.
