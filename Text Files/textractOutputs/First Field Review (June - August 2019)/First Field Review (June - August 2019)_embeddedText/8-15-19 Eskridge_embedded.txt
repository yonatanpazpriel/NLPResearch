Dear Sirs, As a native Californian and a retired publc school teacher, I ask you not to pass the Ethnic Studies course. It is not a balance approach: it does not include both points of view and is slanted against the Jewish people. Also, quite frankly in my experience,students don't need another course in History when they barely know anything about George Washington, the Founding Fathers, and Abraham Lincoln. The basics need to be taught first!
Please don't pass this bill! Janet Eskridge
