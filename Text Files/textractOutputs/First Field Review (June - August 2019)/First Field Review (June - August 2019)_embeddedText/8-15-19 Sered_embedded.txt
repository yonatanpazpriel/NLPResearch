Gentlemen:
Please do not allow the biased, anti-Semitic and dangerous bill AB-331 to pass the legislature as is. It would compel all high school students in California to study the curriculum that glorifies BDS, blatantly slandering Israel and the Jewish people. Safeguards must be placed against similar hijacking of an educational curriculum to promote hatred of any group or individual in future.
According to this curriculum, boycott, divestment and sanctions are intended to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." Israel has created no "apartheid conditions." Its wall was built to ward off terrorist attacks. 1.6 million Arabs are Israeli citizens. The Hamas charter that rules Gaza calls for the murder of Jews and the destruction of Israel. Your "non-violent'' BDS movement has the same purpose: to annihilate Israel and its people--yes all of them--just as did the Holocaust that so many anti-Semites insist never happened.
Already harassment, vandalism and assault against Jewish students and the Jewish State are common on college campuses in California. Your current curriculum, once its students enter college, is an invitation to more of the same--and far worse. Is that what you really want for your educational system?
As a Californian and a graduate of UCLA, I urge you to reconsider this sinister bill and the destruction that may well follow.
Sincerely,
Jean Sered
