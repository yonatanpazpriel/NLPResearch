From: Jaime Shpall Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti-Semitism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am upset by the proposed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a parent of Jewish children in the PAUSD, and as a member of the clergy of Congregation Beth Am, I want my children and young congregants to feel known and safe and heard in their schools.
The proposed curriculum misses the mark in so many ways.   Here are some examples:  Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned,  Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews,  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective,  and most troubling, a song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included in the curriculum.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Cantor Jaime Shpall
