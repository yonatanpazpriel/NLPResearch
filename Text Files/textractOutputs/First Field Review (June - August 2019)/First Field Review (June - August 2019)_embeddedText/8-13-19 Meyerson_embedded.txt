As a former educator I find this new curriculum to be biased, one-sided and virulently anti-Semitic. Education should even handedly explain historical perspectives, improve understand of divers cultures, religions and ways of life. This curriculum is single handedly creating villians out of a culture and religion that predates the religions of most people in California. Understanding differences, looking for similarities, immersing students through creative means to break down barriers should be the goal of education. Stirring up hate in today's political climate in our country adds vicious supports to the voices around the world that want to continue to denigrate a culture and a people who for millennium have wandered around the planet seeking a safe haven. Though many Jews question policies of Israel certainly these issues can be discussed and dealt with in a way to try to heal the wrongs in this world. Most Jews strive to "heal the world ". Otherwise known to the Jewish people as "Tikkun Olam". Your curriculum teaches hate. I am so glad I am no longer teaching. Gloria Meyerson
