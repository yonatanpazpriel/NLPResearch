Where did we go wrong? We are now indoctrinating students in how they need to think. No wonder we are failing miserably in teaching - we have come to the point where we are not teaching the basic reading, writing, arithmetic geography, and history and allowing students to think on their own but the school system is inventing new classes to indoctrinate them into Socialism. I totally object to this type of classes. We need to teach students the facts and let them decide. Not brainwash them. Disgusting type of teaching. Our state rates very low among other states on their scorecard for teaching our students. Sad, sad, sad. More and more parents are taking their children out of public schools and homeschooling them as they do not agree with the curriculum. Taxpayers pay to have their children educated and should be able to choose how and what they want to be taught to their children. Beverly Kelvie Santa Rosa, Ca
