I oppose this because capitalism is not racist its free market ,Shakur is a convicted murderer cop killer who escaped from prison and fled to communist Cuba and this curriculum wants our children to look her up and glorify her and that Iran is a victim of the United States and Israel has no right to exist this curriculum has no business being taught to anyone let alone our children and you want to use our my tax dollars no absolutely no!!
