Since 1989, i have collaborated with scholars scrutinizing how to make curriculum effective for all learners. As editor of Do Not Call Us Negros: How `Multicultural" Textbooks by Professor Sylvia Wynter, an analysis of the Houghton-Mifflin K12 history/social science series, I understood the demotivating impacts of textbooks and training which are designed to demotivate African-American students.

As the author of Our Roots Run Deep: the Black Experience in California, Vols. 1-4, I subsequently have had 28 years of practice in presenting the primary source record of the state's history through the literature, artifacts and art of a population which has been not only obscured but made to feel as though it does not belong in the contemporary California.
In 2007-8, I conducted a commissioned study for the California Council for the Social Studies on the capacity of social science educators to provide culturally responsive instruction. My keynote address to the 2008 conference became the book Black Heritage as Gap Closer.
The findings called for an infusion strategy to create efficacy in classroom practices. This is distinct from the strategy adopted in the draft model curriculum. This strategy has attracted negative comments which detract from the goal of an inclusive school environment.
Creating a series of distinct classes and courses around a set of groups has the exact reverse effect intended. As Professor Wynter noted in 1989, if "ethnic studies" are regarded as distinct courses, then the "mainstream" curriculum is allowed to continue as a universal expression of yet another specific group. With widely varying commitments of training and resources across districts, the most likely result is that only a small percentage of students would actually participate.
The problem the state faces, as noted in the Civil Rights Data Collection of the U.S. Department of Education, is that African-American, Latinx and some Asian-American populations do not take coursework in the subjects which prepare them for high wage professions and higher education.
If all those students took ethnic studies courses, the gaps in math, science and foreign language would still persist
Our approach to infusion would organize the discussion around disciplines and the existing frameworks and materials.
In a proof of concept with students in San Francisco's most distressed public housing complex in 2010, we created a science magnet embedded with African-American scientists in person and as subjects of inquiry. The curriculum design was a inquiry designed around the impact of salt in their lives.

Our observation for African-American students is that because of the societal stigmas regarding African-Americans that students recoil from overt classes on "black history". What they respond to heartily is the strategic prescriptive placement of positive cultural referents in the skills classes that they normally feel alienated from.
A simple way to achieve this infusion is to engage all students as the first chapter of the California History/Social Science Framework describes in "finding their place in space and time." For 90 percent of the students in the state, this never occurs. Many get the sense of belonging through family ties. But this lack of a sense of belonging is the number one factor in the lack of motivation and achievement that is aggregated among African-American students.
This effort will avoid politicization and the alarming polemical statements by focusing on describing how different groups of underrepresented populations are included across the curriculum so that teachers have a repertoire of tools to use in every classroom setting.
As we are seeing in the debate about the mural at George Washington High School in San Francisco, schools are not the place to decide the profound social issues of American life. What they should do and can do best is to give every one a scientifically validated, authentically expressed foundation of the full reach of the human experience.
For our part, we created ReUNION: Education-Arts-Heritage as the African-American children's channel in 2010. But we don't do programs on black history. We take the thematic strands of history, science, math and music and create explorations which any learner or educator would feel comfortable pursuing and relating to their own lives.
In Road to Ratification: How 27 States Face the Most Challenging Issue in American History, we were inspired by a request from the Historic State Capitol to interpret the California adoption of the 13th Amendment. We eventually found the resolution of adoption from 32 states. It is significant that all those state legislatures were comprised of white men.
So one can't separate the most important event in African-American history from the whites who decided to part from 246 years of a practice which was the primary economic engine for the entire nation.
That centrality is the objective we should seek instead of even more marginalization. For 18 years, we have celebrated the fact that an African-American built California's first public school, after funding the American forces during the Mexican War. Not a single school board member has responded to the invitations.

We are hampering student lives by not using the full repertoire of this wide world. The 6,000 site California AfricanAmerican Freedom Trail is a resource that all educators can use in all 58 counties.
The most important speech in African-American history, A Memorial Discourse by Rev. Henry Highland Garnet, is never mentioned in this country's classrooms. The sermon to mark the Congressional passage of the 13th Amendment on Feb. 12, 1865 set the tone for the end of slavery. Eighteen states would ratify the first amendment in 60 years during the month of February. As a Presbyterian ruling elder, I reenacted the sermon at his church in Washington, D.C. and offered an overture to the 223d General Assembly to republish the speech as a book by the Presbyterian Church USA. The measure was passed 485 to 9. It is a demonstration that inclusion can win broad acceptance without evoking controversy.
