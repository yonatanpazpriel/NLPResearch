P. 234 In the Arab American Studies Outline, the three topics presented are problematic. Comparing the situations in Israel and Palestine with Black Lives Matter and Mexico (Issues of Racism and immigration) does not acknowledge the profound difference in these situations. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas (West Bank and Gaza) have publically stated that Israel does not have a right to exist. That presents a profound security threat for Israel � being a small democratic country, surrounded by Arab Regimes (Palestine, Lebanon, Syria) who want to wipe Israel out. These situations are very nuanced and multilayered, that this curriculum is not prepared to address.

Also BDS Sanctions against Israel is a problematic topic if differing perspectives on the issue are not presented � namely one in which shows BDS as an expression of anti-semitism
P. 242 Lines that refer to the founding of Israel 5157-5161 present a politically biased version of the founding of the state of Israel. Many scholars show that the displacement of Palestinians were also the result on the Arab attacks on the new Jewish immigrants that were coming to the land. The curriculum language suggests Israel as a colonizing force where there are other legitimate presentations of the displacement as the result of war that local Palestinians helped initiate.
P. 268-269 Lines 5802-5803 uses the anti-semitic trope of Jewish control of the media ("Use the press so they can manufacture...") to accuse Israel of colonizing land. Again, there is more than one narrative of history � and in the case of Israel/Palestine, there are multiple narratives backed by true historical testimonies and scholarly study.

In regard to Israel/Palestinian history, only one perspective is presented, when this is a complex issue that doesn't acknowledge the context of anti-semitism that puts Israel's actions in a different perspective. There is no acknowledgement of Palestinian responsibility in the conflict that leads to border, immigration, and state-building issues. Israel is a democratic state that offers full rights of it's arab citizens. They have supreme court justices � the highest office of law in the land that are Arab.
In order to present education on these issues, there needs to be collaboration and input from Jewish history and political academics to provide the other side of the narrative. Students deserve to know both Jewish and Arab perspectives on the conflict.
