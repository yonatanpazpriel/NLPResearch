From: Irwin-Kathryn Weiss Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 10:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethnic guidelines
The guidelines sound like they were written by Lewis Farrakhan and a few one-sided Palestinians. Why pick on tiny Israel and by inference, slander the tiny number of Jews who live in our state?
If we're going to address ethnic guidelines for California students, I demand that Every minority - including Jews - be addressed with the respect that they have earned and do deserve.
