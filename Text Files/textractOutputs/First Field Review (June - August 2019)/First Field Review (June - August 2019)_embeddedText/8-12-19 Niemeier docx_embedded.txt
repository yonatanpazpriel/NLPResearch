As a taxpayer in the State of California, and as a practicing CPA who has helped many taxpayers from a broad spectrum of ethnicities, I strongly object to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. The Curriculum is incorrect in many of its representations of capitalism, its analysis of certain ethnic groups, and its claim of value to the students.
The links between freedom and capitalism are unmistakable. The example of 20th century Germany is important. When the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 by the Communist state known as the GDR (German Democratic Republic), it separated the peoples of Germany and completely surrounded the free zone in the western part of the City of Berlin, thereafter referred to as "West Berlin". Hundreds of people were shot trying to escape from the GDR by crossing the wall into West Berlin; others were put into prison for lengthy terms. The economy of the GDR was centrally-planned by the government and increasingly state-owned. However, when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, people immediately set up vending tables on the street and began selling and trading with each other. The government had failed, and they began to take care of themselves. Most of the young people under 30 years of age in the GDR had never lived freely.
One only needs to contrast the government's failed social policies of the last 75 years in the United States with the success of entrepreneurs and their owners/employees to see the beneficial effects of capitalism. Centralized government has not generated the great advances of civilization.
It is not the role of education, based on mandates from government, to indoctrinate students with a biased social, economic, and political theory that comes with its own selfserving vocabulary. The curriculum outlined as the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is based on ideologies that have failed people miserably around the world, such as in Venezuela at this very moment, and it will deprive students of the freedom, hope and great potential offered by a knowledge of capitalism. This curriculum also plays the `blame game' typical of tyrannical regimes, and makes victims of its students. Labeling capitalism as racist is ignorant at the very least. Capitalism has been an `engine' of progress, yielding greater food production, improved medicines and healthcare, more and better jobs, and an increase in the standard of living of millions of people around the world.

One of the world's respected socioeconomic researchers, Fernand Braudel, famously said "In no society have all regions and all parts of the population developed equally." The establishment of a curriculum that promotes unachievable outcomes based on government's definition of what is "fair" or based on a trendy definition of "social justice" is in itself unfair to the students. It denies them an understanding of how economies really work.

Recent statistics show that the number of women entrepreneurs in the United States has nearly tripled in the last 30 years. Reports from outside the U.S., most notably from Africa, provide details on the high growth rate of women-owned businesses in recent years. These trends and others like them that are fueled by capitalism could be stopped completely if the type of thinking promoted in this curriculum is allowed to spread in California, in the U.S. and worldwide.
