I completely disagree with your ethnic study curriculum. Teachers should not teach as fact that our country's free market is racist. That should be left to parents. My legal immigrant Mexican husband came to America because of it's capitalism and it's safety because it's a country of laws. He doesn't want illegals coming here and can't stand that his country is falling apart. Sue Lopez
May God richly bless you.
