Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Glossary, page 2: The glossary definition of the BDS movement is very misleading. The definition does not say that its goal is the destruction of Israel, as can be seen in this Al Jazeera article on one of the co-founders of BDS: https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/denies-entry-bds-founderomar-barghouti-190411174724070.html. The glossary definition also does not mention that the US House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution opposing BDS in July of this year (2019).

The last line of page 277 of the 299 page long file with sample lesson plans recommends the CAIR website as a source of information for students.

The whole curriculum is misleading. No where does it mention Hamas or other Palestinian groups targeting Israeli homes and schools when firing rockets at Israel. No where does it mention Hamas being on the State Department's list of terrorists. The whole curriculum is unbalanced and misleading and will do the students and teachers who use it a disservice, encouraging hatred of Israel rather than promoting a problem solving approach to a centuries old problem in the middle east: religious and ethnic warfare and oppression by Muslims and Christians.
