I was excited to hear that California was going to introduce a new ethnic

studies curriculum, only to then be horrified to learn the curriculum is hard

line to the point of being laughable (for instance, Capitalism certainly creates

problems, but it is not a wholly evil system and it is certainly not equivalent to

white supremacy).

In addition, the new curriculum marginalizes Jews. Jews at worship were murdered in San Diego county just months ago -- what were the creators of this curriculum thinking to leave anti-Semitism off the list of types of hatred that Californians have suffered? The curriculum goes on to present a very one-sided view of the Boycott, Sanctions, Divestments movement (BDS). The Israeli/Palestinian conflict is infinitely more complicated than BDS suggests, and prominent Palestinian activists (like Bassem Eid) do not support it as a solution to any of the regions problems.

California can do better than this hot mess. Our children deserve to be taught better than this, and our citizens of all ethnicities and backgrounds deserve to feel they are welcome and safe in our great state.
