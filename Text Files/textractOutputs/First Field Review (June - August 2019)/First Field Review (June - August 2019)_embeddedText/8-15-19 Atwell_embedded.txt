From: AngelaHope Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:46 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Curriculum
To: California Department of Education
We are deeply concerned with proposed ethnic-studies curriculum in California. It is one-sided anti-Israel, anti-Semetic, anti-American, and anti-capitalist rhetoric. This is political indoctrination of our students and is unacceptable.
We stand with Israel and real American Patriots to remove this dangerous curriculum proposal immediately!
Sincerely,
Patrick & Angela Atwell Tulare, California
