I submitted earlier comments that were pointed out to me as being negative without offering positive solutions. So I am submitting these comments as possible positive solutions. Pg 2, Lines 42-47: Capitalism. Use unbiased, actual definition such as: Capitalism is an economic system using free market, private enterprise businesses to provide goods and services for others based on their needs and wants. It is a consumer driven economy. (Then within the curriculum use true historical facts to show how this system has had both good and bad results. Example: good � it allowed for the raise of the middle class with the increase in the standard of living. Bad: the exploitation of the workers of all ethnicities but resulting in the rise of labor unions � including the United Farm Workers � which improved working conditions and wages.) By starting with a neutral and truthful definition and using balanced actual historical facts, the students can then use their critical thinking skills to reach their own conclusions. That's education rather than indoctrination. The student knows how to think not what to think. Pg 14: Add definition of Socialism: Socialism: an economic system using the government to centrally plan and control the economy by using government bureaucrats deciding what and how much to produce and set the prices to charge. It is a government driven economy. (Then within the curriculum use true historical facts to show how this system has had both good and bad results. Example: Good � I don't know one. Bad: USSR, Venezuela, Cuba, Somalia... I did not include Europe because those countries are not socialist economies � they use capitalism to pay for their social welfare programs).
