From: Susan Fleming Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 2:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: CA Ethnic Studies Comment
Sir: I do NOT want to purchase a Microsoft compatible computer in order to make my comments which you solicited. You have no options for Apple users!
I am appalled and horrified at the curricula. This document is biased in the extreme. For example, since when are patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy compatible examples of badly used power? I am OPPOSED to the use of this curriculum. Also, which of the currently required high school courses will be dropped in order to add this? In order to meet required UC entrance standards, there is no room for yet another required course.
Sincerely, Susan & Myron Fleming
