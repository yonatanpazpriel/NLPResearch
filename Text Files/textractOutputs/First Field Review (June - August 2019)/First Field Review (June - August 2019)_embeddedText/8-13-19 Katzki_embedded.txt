Dear CA School Board Members -
I applaud your intentions with the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum - but am shocked at its draft content. There indeed needs to be a progressive curriculum. Unbalanced anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias is, however, not progressive. The intolerance shown towards Jews over the years, and in particular in the holocaust inflicted by Nazis, is the ultimate case study of what happens with intolerance - yet it is not in the curriculum. The great participation by Jews in supporting and advancing civil rights in this country is a case study of community - yet not mentioned in the curriculum. Israel is the result of intolerance, becoming a refuge for those that have suffered intolerance, including so many Jews from Arab countries - yet is only mentioned in a negative way. There are two sides to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. It the curriculum chooses to introduce it, then it should represent both sides - and in a balanced way.
You have a great responsibility as our school board members, to future generations, in introducing this curriculum. The way it is now drafted, it will result in future generations of anti-Semitism. I doubt this is your intent. So, I am hopeful that you will make substantive changes , as suggested above, to adjust to a curriculum that truly encourages understanding and tolerance of all.
