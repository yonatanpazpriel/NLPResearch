From: jgnassi Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: RE: Blatant Anti-Semitism and Anti-Israel Agenda
To the Members of this Board I state the OBVIOUS, that the Ethnic Studies Curriculum, as now constructed, has been politically high-jacked in order to attack the Jewish-American community.... That such a draft even found the light of day, says it all!! I cannot even fully express my frustration and amazement that this could happen here..I was born and raised in the beautiful (in the past, at least) city of San Francisco, and, currently reside on the Peninsula..My two sons, as well as myself, attended public schools, as do my grandchildren currently..We are a Jewish-American family, proud of the many important contributions made to this great state by Jews, in particular, in the areas of Civil Rights, and, inclusion of ALL groups...Do not, ironically and hypocritically, now discriminate against us! The future of our Society is at risk. Thank-you, Jean G. Nassi Mountain View, CA
