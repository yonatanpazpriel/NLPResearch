I have a real problem with a curriculum that includes made-up words like "Chicanx" and "hxrstory." I can see the reasoning behind "Chicanx," because the "-o" ending in "Chicano" indicates the masculine gender, even though changing the grammatical rules of another language because it doesn't fit the opinions of some Americans is cultural appropriation in the most blatant form. But "hxrstory" is taking this to a new low. Not only is this word completely fabricated in order to advance an agenda, not only does this word violate every principle of reading and spelling that we spend all of elementary school teaching, but the "his-" in "history" has absolutely no connection to gender whatsoever. We are teaching students lies about the meanings and origins of words. I just can't get behind teaching lies to students in order to advance an agenda. This madness needs to stop now. California can't afford to lose any more working families and qualified teachers to Texas and other states because of this stuff being forced upon them.
