This is the most obscene proposal I have ever had the displeasure to read in my entire adult life (I'm 77). The people that wrote this piece of garbage have quit literally lost their minds. This is indoctrination to accomplish total elimination of all analytical thought processes. If this asinine program continues, I foresee an uprising/revolution in this country the likes of which we have never witnessed before. This is insane. The people that conceived of this program and the people that are supporting it are insane. It is much easier to point out what is right about this proposal than point out what is wrong with it. There absolutely ISN'T anything right about this proposal. It is absolutely, 100%, totally insane.
