The curriculum's core failing is that it presents as theory a system of analyzing and critiquing power structures that is itself a poorly tested hypothesis. The model curriculum, and the language contained therein, is rooted in very specific perspectives that, while having merit at times, assert an extraordinarily normative view of history and society. To elevate these highly charged views to co-equal status with other analytical frameworks, let alone to provide them primacy of place in the state's educational mandates, would be a grievous failure.
