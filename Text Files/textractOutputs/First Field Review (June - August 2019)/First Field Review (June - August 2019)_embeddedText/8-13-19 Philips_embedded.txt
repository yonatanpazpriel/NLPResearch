From: Rick Philips Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Tragedy and Irony of the ESMC draft
The ESMC Draft is both ironic and tragic.
The barely concealed, unnecessary political bias against market economies and 'capitalism' is overshadowed by the blatant exclusion of the American Jewish ethnic and minority experience as well as the exclusion of Jewish contributions to the history of California and the US and the longstanding commitment in history of Jewish Americans to racial and ethnic equality and respect.
Then the not-so-subtle advocacy for BDS promotes a vile, antisemitic, and international movement to build ethnic hatred against Israel and the Jews. This has no place in the ESMC or in Ethnic Studies anywhere. This vicious hate-based attack on a diverse country with exemplary laws and freedoms applies a double-standard to the actions and very existence of the Jewish State. A California Ethnic Studies curriculum should not be promoting antisemitism, racism or a double-standard applied to an ethnic group.
It is difficult to separate promotion of ethnic diversity and respect from the extreme political movements that have attached to it. However, the people of California know that the goals of the ESMC can be achieved without abandoning real equality and fairness for all people.
And advocacy for one political-economic system (Marxism) is outside of the mandate for this curriculum.
