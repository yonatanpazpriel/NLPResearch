This new Ethnic Studies Curriculum does NOT belong in our public schools. California shouldn't be educating children to become extreme activists. I see this as complete indoctrination of young minds. Not good for our State and our Country. No wonder so many people are taking their children out of public schools and leaving California.
Sincerely, Mrs. E. Simmons
