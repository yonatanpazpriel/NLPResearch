Hello,
Regarding the new ethnic studies guidelines; my comment is not related to a specific page number or lesson but rather an overall comment and concern. I feel there is not specific guidelines and or content information regarding lessons on slavery and the historical effect that history has had on the United States and Latin America. Also, there does not seem to be specific guidelines and or content information regarding lessons on the history of Native Americans. Specifically for California, Florida, and Texas it would be great to have specific guidelines and or content information regarding lessons on the effects of Spanish conquest and subsequent United States manifest destiny. Also, specific guidelines and or content information regarding lessons on the history refugees.
The ethnic history of the United States and World History is history. It would be great to have those stories woven into the curriculum and when we teach lessons on political, social, and economic trends there needs to be discussions about who is marginalized by whom and why and what has been the result.
Thank you,
