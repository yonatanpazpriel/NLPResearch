Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
As a Korean-American, I disagree with this and please study your own further that Korea and Japan has a long history just like Greece and Tureky. If you want the different gap or further segregation in between Koreans and Japanese, you want this to continue. However, if you know the history how Germany has apologized and still tries to find and execute the people who participated in Nazi, this should be revised. I'm a Korean-American living in CA and disagree with this, and I think schools should reflect unbiased views especially history. Thank you.
