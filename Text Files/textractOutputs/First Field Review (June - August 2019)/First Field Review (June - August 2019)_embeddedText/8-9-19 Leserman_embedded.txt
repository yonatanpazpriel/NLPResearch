However, Whiteness is much more than a racial identity marker, it separates those that are privileged from those that are not. Whiteness can manifest as a social, economic, political, and cultural behavior and power. For example, the "standard" or cultural "norm" are often always basedan on whiteness and by extension white culture, norms, and values." General: This set of lesson plans focuses on RACE without explaining that this is a NONSCIENTIFIC term that has been disproved biologically. Page 8 of 214: European Immigration (Italians, Jewish, Polish, Irish, Serbian, etc.) Topics will include history and waves of European immigration to the United States, the role of World Wars I and II , the Cold War, Iron Curtain, and Communism played in immigration polices and effects on populations of immigrants. Students will participate in the analysis and discussion of economic opportunities, escape from religious persecution, humanitarian crisis, famine, and labor trends for wealthy, skilled or unskilled, workers. What have been the United States government polices that have accelerated or slowed European Migration to America?" Jewish is an ethnoreligious identity, not a nationality like Italian, Polish, Irish, or Serbian. Document should correctly spell HISTORY. The word does not connote gender identity and should not be misspelled to accommodate a ridiculous mistaken sense of having been wronged. Page 44 of 214: This unit focuses inappropriately on Arab MUSLIMS, when 63% of American Arabs are Christian. and a large proportion are Jewish. General: Overview inappropriately associates "whiteness" with "white supremacy" which marginalizes and demonizes our students who identify as white. Page 44 of 214: The Israel/Palestine conflict is beyond the purview of any American ethnic studies class. In particular, the focus here is on demonizing and marginalizing students with religious and familial connections to Israel. Paginationn is incorrect, 288 of 303 pages are marked "299 of 300"
Did Arab States declare that they would "drive Jews into the sea" -- Yes, they did. This is not heresay, but fact, and if it is reference, this should be clear.

"Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel" -- Mention of this is entirely inappropriate and targets a tiny Jewish country as the major challenge to Arab countries, which is factually incorrect. Their major problem is a lack of democracy. Page ? "immigrant Jew like Lionel Cohen and his famous Lionel toy trains " -- His name was Joshua Cowen (check spelling) and his first claim to fame was for a device to ignite a photographer's flash. This is the only mention of Jewish people except with reference to Arabs. 249 of 316 - Linda Sarsour as a person of Arab ancestry to research? She is a notable anti-semite! Helen Thomas? Anti-semite ---Likewise Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib
