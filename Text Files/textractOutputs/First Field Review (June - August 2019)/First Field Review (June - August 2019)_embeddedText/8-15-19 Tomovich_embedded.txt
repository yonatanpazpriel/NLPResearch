Soomin Chao Chair Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901 Dear Soomin Chao, I am writing to you in regard to the state's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, ESMC. As an educator, parent, and Jewish woman I think it is important that the curriculum have a fair and balanced view of how Jews have played an important part in the history of this country and unfortunately how they have been affected by hate crimes as well. Leaving out the Jewish experience would not be educating the students of this state about an important ethnic group that has had a big impact in California and the U.S. I am urging you to make sure you add the Jewish experience to the curriculum you are working on for the state of California, to inform our students of the rich culture of the Jewish people as well as not adding to any stereotypes people have regarding Jews or negative information on Israel. The information needs to be facts and not opinions. Thank you for your time. Sincerely, Audrey Tomovich
