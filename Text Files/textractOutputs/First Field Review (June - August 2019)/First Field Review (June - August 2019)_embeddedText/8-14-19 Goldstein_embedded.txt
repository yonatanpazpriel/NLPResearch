In their August 12, 2019 Joint Statement on Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, the State Board of Education (SBOE) President, Vice President, and one Board Member, stated a Board requirement that "A model curriculum should be accurate, free of bias . . . ." This concept appears in one form or another in every state statute and/or regulations dealing with public education, and in the rules and policies of every local board of education, as far as I am aware. All instructional material presented to the students must be accurate and unbiased.
The draft Model here fails to meet that basic standard, in that the document presents inaccurate material, both in the document itself, and, more particularly, in the information provided in many of the links to outside materials, which are adopted into the main document by reference. Most of the several we have reviewed contain much inaccurate material, and they evince an overall bias in favor of Islam and against Jews and Israel. We must keep in mind that the links contain most of the material that the students will be required to learn, and this is the material they will internalize.
The Glossary definition of BDS is exemplary of inaccurate material. It states, in pertinent part, "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. . . . the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. . . ." This definition is inaccurate.
The true documented goal of the BDS movement is not for the Arabs to live in a peaceful, fair relationship with their neighbor Israel. It is the destruction of the State of Israel. We know this because in their more candid moments the leaders of the BDS movement have told us that the primary goal of the BDS movement is the destruction of Israel -- from the Jordan River on its east to the Mediterranean Sea on its west. BDS co-founder Omar Barghouti vowed, making no secret of his intentions, that "Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine." His sentiment was echoed by leading BDS activists Asad Abu Khalili and Ahmed Moor, who declared that "The real aim of

BDS is to bring down the state of Israel" and "BDS does mean the end of the Jewish state." This is the true goal of BDS, including its on-campus movement in the United States.

Secondly, the Proposed Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum has a panoply of course material relating to almost all ethnic groups recognized under the "intersectionality" concept. Only the Jews are missing. It is as though the drafters of the Proposed Model were determined to erase any knowledge of Jewish achievements in medicine, biology, physics, engineering, computers, literature, and the arts. This is a non-exclusive list. Very significantly, Jewish concepts in philosophy and ethics, revealed to them by G-d at Mt. Sinai and developed by Jewish scholars through the next three millennia, form the very basis of Western society and ethics, including those of the United States. But the Model Curriculum would keep this information from California Ethnic Studies high school students.

We applaud the SBOE's statement that the curriculum "falls short and needs to be substantially redesigned," and that a new draft will be developed for potential approval. PJTN most strongly demands that any new draft, prior to being submitted to the Instructional Quality Commission, undergo a most vigorous fact checking process, to include review by several expert organizations on the other side of the pedagogy/ideological divide from the iteration of the draft currently before us. This fact checking must include references to specific source documents supporting all criticisms noted. Of vital importance: the fact checking, in addition to considering the main document for accuracy and lack of bias, must also review all links to instructional material embedded in the new draft model curriculum.

Thank you for your consideration.
