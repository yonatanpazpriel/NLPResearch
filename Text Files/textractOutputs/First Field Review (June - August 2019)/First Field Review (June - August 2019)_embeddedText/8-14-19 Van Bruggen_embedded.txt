From: Neal Van Bruggen Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies
The study of Ethnic Groups should be ONLY decided by the Local School Board and parents of that community. If it approved by the School Board, it should be listed as a special class. Also, it should be a study of all Ethnic Groups, if offered. It's time for schools to pay attention to the (3) R's, Reading, Writing and Arithmetic, while many students are graduating without the basics. You see on TV, when asked about current events, they also do not have a clue what is going on around them. My feeling is that government should stay out of education curriculum. Parents and School Boards should make the final decision on what is taught in our schools.
Thank you,
