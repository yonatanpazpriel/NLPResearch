From: Shoshana Himelson Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 10:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC")
Dear Sirs,
Please excuse my typing - I have one broken hand at the moment. I feel so strongly about this matter so no matter how my typing is I have to do my part and show my objections to this � even if there may be some bad grammar or spelling here and there.
I am writing this a day before the apparent deadline and I don't have as much time as I'd like to read over the whole document from beginning to end and examine it further but even a cursory look of a layman will see what this is all about.
I am writing to you concerning a / the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC") for public school students. Whichever persons put this information together is 100% bias in their opinion, which absolutely leaves no room for other Ethnic opinions. The Ethnic Studies model � seems very much to be pointing the finger at one particular people. This is so unconstitutional �it should be made illegal. I've no idea who may be thinking of approving such statements to teach innocent children in schools - - only those who do not want peace with all nor wish to bother to examine the matter openly and give honest opinions. It is shocking. Children can easily come to to their own opinions in time about many matters and you are coming to fill their minds with trash and lies.
This document has many inaccuracies you have not done your homework nor read this well enough. This second bill, AB-331 in my humble opinion needs to be trashed as soon as possible.
Would you mind to publish the names of the peoples that worked on this, their last or first names. Were there for example a few Abduls or some similar sounding names by any chance??
So many decent mothers and fathers in the U.S. these days are concerned for their children in so many ways � and just want them to live healthy, moral, happy, normal and safe lives and with your proposed Curriculum this should give them so much more to be concerned about including hate of certain peoples, which we all know only too well unfortunately leads to violence of which there is too much in this world. This so much looks like the outlook of certain Arab populations that feed their kids with hate and violence through their mother's milk almost and at such young tender ages they can be seen holding arms ready to kill. This is what you so called proposed Curriculum resemble � and you all yourselves should be held accountable for any bad incident that could result from this. I suggest you take this Curriculum shred it to pieces then burn it � as some ...... have done with the American flag.

Why on earth should there be any need to mention about Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions for example and elimination of the State of Israel ("BDS") in a Curriculum to teach in schools?? This is totally not acceptable for many reasons but just one being that it spreads hate of one particular group of people.
How can a curriculum devote substantial resources to teaching about Islamophobia --and nothing about antisemitism?? Something is very wrong about this � even young Public School students can see that. This is just total pro-Palestinian indoctrination.
This material is totally devoid of factual content and historical context � in other words it is not truth. It does look a bit odd that in the glossary includes every imaginable form of prejudice, except one � antisemitism. Why is that?? If there is an alarming rise of antisemitism on college campuses these days we only have people who write these type of Curriculums to thank. This type of garbage will not make America great by any means� it will only bring it down further � until such a point where one cannot imagine having a peaceful life any more.
There have been significant contributions by Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and the ESMC manages to erase this fact. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
On top of this it denigrates both Israel and Jews.
There is an interesting list of recommended topics for students to investigate such as;
Anti-Arab and Muslim Violence
Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter
Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel
Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico
This is so blatantly one sided.
"Studies" such as these do not belong in a school the U.S.A � even though they may be
popular in some Moslem countries; perhaps you need to look for another outlet.
Go and ask parents of the schools if they would like their children to learn this material � perhaps if you dare why not even venture to show this to a Jewish school or Jewish parents and listen to what they think!.
You seem to want to be so creative so why not please try and attempt to do something
more worthwhile with your lives � and try to create more peace in the world � don't break down our world and our children- and don't destroy the U.S. more than it is already. We've all had enough already!
From one who truly desires peace in the U.S. and worldwide.
