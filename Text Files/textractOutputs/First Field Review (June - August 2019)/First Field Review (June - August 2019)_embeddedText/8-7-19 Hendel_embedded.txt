Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable) This curriculum is important and will help California better understand the
history and significance of the Arab community. Page 233 shows the contribution of Arabs to our society and will help ameliorate prejudice and misunderstandings.
Page 236 explains the history of Arab Americans and their contributions. It's so important to break down stereotypes in this period in our history.
General: Please support this curriculum. It's important to do so for our future. If it matters, I write this as a Jewish American. Please don't let the attitudes and fears of some pro-Israeli activists derail this project. Thank you
