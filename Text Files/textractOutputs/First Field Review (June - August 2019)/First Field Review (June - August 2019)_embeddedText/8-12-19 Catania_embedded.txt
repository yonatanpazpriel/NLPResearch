From: Melissa Catania Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 1:29 PM To: CFIRD Subject: Ethnic Studies curriculum
The ethnic studies curriculum being proposed is an overreaching, divisive, radical, social justice warrior nightmare, not in line with the values of most Californians, and harmful to our children. Capitalism is a "form of power and oppression?" Are you kidding me? In a time when we should be improving the way we teach math, and emphasizing it, you have these people telling us that math is somehow "racist." The most egregious thing that I've seen in the plan, however, is the glorification of (much less even mentioning) activist, violent, criminal black and latino figures. Are these the best people you can come up with in our history to represent blacks and latinos? I hardly think so. Governor Brown was right to oppose this. It's just wrong on so many levels.
Sincerely,
Melissa Catania
