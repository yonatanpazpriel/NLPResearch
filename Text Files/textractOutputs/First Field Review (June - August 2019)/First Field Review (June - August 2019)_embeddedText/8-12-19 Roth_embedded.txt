Line 5033 on page 237 and Line 5141 on page 241. The identification of Israel-Palestine and also as Palestine/Israel. Palestine is NOT recognized as a State by the United States of America, as well as most of the European Union, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand. The Arabs living in the area NEVER established a Palestinian State when the UN in 1947 recommended a partition of an Arab and a Jewish State that became known as Israel, not a Palestinian State. There is NO Palestine in the Bible. How can you refer to the land known as Israel as Israel-Palestine and Palestine/Israel? Line 5162 on page 242. The definition of Nakba as the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new State of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War. There were many factors involved with the voluntary self-removal from Israel, but the single most important that you fail to recognize is that most Arabs fled as they were unwilling to live in a Jewish State. Lines 4956 � 4958 on page 234. The Assigning of this topic for student reports: Call to Boycott Divest and Sanction Israel (BDS). BDS proponents demonize Israel and call for outsiders to punish the citizens of Israel until they capitulate. BDS proponents are only interested in pressuring Israel to make concessions and hold Palestinians blameless for the current conflict. Seeking to present Palestinian grievances out of context and without consideration of parallel Israeli concerns is neither constructive or fair in any way. Making partisan political demands that are clearly aimed at a different outcome, not a TWO STATE solution, but a one state Solution, and the destruction of the only Jewish State in the World has. Lines 4956 � 4958 on page 234The Assigning of this topic for student reports: Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico. Based on all the previous points, it is obvious why this topic has no merit.
