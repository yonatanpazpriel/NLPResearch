Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Page 13, line 307�This goal is unclear, because it could easily falsely equate capitalism with empire, instead of treating capitalism as the sociopolitical transformative process that destroys empires through competition and creative destruction.

Such clearly politicized material and language appears throughout this document and undermines the trust that the community has in the state's institution of education. Of course, if it's gotten this far, it is concerning that the neutrality and integrity of those in charge of such a staggeringly important task has been compromised. The tone, frankly, of the entire program is one of victimization and not empowerment. Conquering oppression is not done by deep integration of racial resentment, a combative tone, and a wrong-headed cascade of manipulative lenses but by celebration, education, and positivity.

This approach would perhaps be appropriate for an outwardly political studies class at a university, but as education for children who will be stunted by this anti-critical process, it is reprehensible and akin to direct religious indoctrination.]
