The model curriculum omits anti-semitism. The attack on the Chabad Jewish synagogue in California that killed a congregant is a prime example of the urgent need for its inclusion. More generally, anti-semitic hate crimes constitute more than half of the hate crimes in the United States. California has a large Jewish population, including Holocaust survivors. 6002-6004: References to Israeli control of the press is a blatant anti-semitic trope. BDS references are a singular double-standard applied solely to Israel. In the absence of a comprehensive list of world-wide boycott movements, this is a blatant example of anti-semitism. 5761-5762 The reference to Palestinian stereotypes " destroy Israel, drive Jews into the sea" are presented as totally false, whereas there is significant history behind this. The Hamas charter calls for the death of Jews. The Palestinian Authority incentivizes terror attacks on Israeli citizens by paying salaries to terrorists who kill children.
