Dear Kenneth McDonald and the Curriculum advisory committee,
I would like to thank you and your team for your recent statement condemning the California Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum.
However, as a community member I am still deeply concerned that similar biases will arise in future curriculum. I am urging you to ensure that any future materials brought forward be inclusive of Jewish and Israeli-American students, their heritage and identity, and bar any anti-Israel and antisemitic sentiments which may marginalize them.
In addition, I ask that you respectfully consider removing the currently proposed curriculum from the California Department of Education website. Each day that the file is available does more damage to the educational environment. As it has already been announced that the curriculum will change, this unacceptable material should no longer be available to influence the public.
Finally, I would like to share this video with you (http://bit.ly/2MkHYJh), of a young Israeli-American student telling his story and addressing what teens within our community are facing in California today.
Thank you.
