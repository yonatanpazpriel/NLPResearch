Public schools are not to be used for propaganda or opinions. Absolute non starter to teach our students that Capitalism is racist and or a bad economic way of life. Capitalism is not perfect, but nothing is perfect in life. Socialism and communism are deadly ways of economics. It is all about dictators and control of the people. Sorry, AMERICA is all about Freedom. Talking with lots of parents and teachers, they will pull out of public schools if this is taught. It is already bd enough that CA is putting forth a sick and twisted curriculum on sex education.
