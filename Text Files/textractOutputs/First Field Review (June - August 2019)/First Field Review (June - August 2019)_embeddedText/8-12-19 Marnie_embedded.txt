I cannot afford Word. I am a parent and want to give my input.
Your ethnic studies are biased. The pages do not have numbers. You are trying to suggest that the past racism that happened is still happening today. This is not correct. First, if a person is in poverty in America, it is by choice. We are free to do anything we want. If you want to succeed one must put effort and time into it. If you want a job develop a skill set. It may require working two jobs for a period of time, but you can overcome poverty. Your privilege walk is unacceptable. You are intentionally trying to make kids, whose parents have made wise choices and put time and effort to get where they are, to feel bad or wrong because of their lifestyle. You are promoting classism against them. You are trying to glorify disadvantaged kids. You suggest the New York Times as reference throughout your curriculum. Why is that? They have been proven to be lying to the public. You actually promote Black Panthers and Black Lives Matters which are known domestic terrorists. Do you recall BLM killing five police officers in one week? Your instruction is outrageous and unacceptable. Tell the history as it was. Today, we have many laws to prevent discrimination. You are trying to teach students that this is a mainstream problem when it is isolated incidents. Quit trying to make white students feel bad because of their race.
