Dear all,
I am deeply concerned by what I read. Being an immigrant myself and being an Independent voter, I was hoping that basic attempt to include a variety of perspectives would be made. However, the perspectives included in ALL instances treat immigrants as unfortunate victims of American xenophobia, no effort is made at all to have children represent and think through perspectives other than the present Democratic perspectives. There is no attempt to lend legitimacy to the country's citizens who are concerned about the changing cultural landscape, no attempt was made to consider potential legitimacy of restrictions on immigration and reasons for a immigration policy that exists for every country in the world. Is it unreasonable for children to understand that some people seeking entry into the country are genuinely looking to be part of the American experiment and some come here with a clear effort to do harm? In other words, can we include the whole picture and not only the politically correct one?
Respectfully,
