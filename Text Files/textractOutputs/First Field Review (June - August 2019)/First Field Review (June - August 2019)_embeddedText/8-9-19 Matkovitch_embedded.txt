Dear Tony,
I'm writing to you as a CA resident and a very worried mom. The Department of Education California is creating a new ethnic studies curriculum. The curriculum does not recognize Jews as a minority in the US. Furthermore, it calls for boycotting Israel (in 3 different classes), attempt to explain the conflict in the middle east using a single-sided story, encourage aggression against Israelis, and spread hate against Israelis and jews.
We had over +200 mass shootings this year. Almost all of them directed towards minorities and many of them directed towards Israelis and jews. I would not be able to sleep at night if I ever hear that the next shooter learned that "jews are bad" in these classes - I hope you wouldn't either. I will be terrified to send my kids to school knowing that their fellow students are thought that Israelis, jews (or African American or Latinos or Muslims) - are bad.
I hear of school bullying because of ethnicity is on the rise. I tear when I see a mass shooting towards minorities, whether in a mosque or a synagogue.
The last thing we need in California and the US in general - is more hate. We need more love. More respect. To all people and all minorities. So both you and I can send our kids to school and feel safe.
There are 300,000 jews living in California that can be directly affected if we spread hate against them. My kids will have a much higher chance to get bullied just because he is Jewish. Is that the education system we want to build in CA?
If you really do care about the safety of our children - please act now. You are my public representative and I trust you would do so. Will you please help?
Thank you, Efrat, a mother of 2 from San Jose
