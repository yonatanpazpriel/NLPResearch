I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. I also respectfully request the inclusion of American Jews as an ethnic minority, and frequent targets of racism.
Pg. 2� This definition of the BDS movement is blatantly one-sided, showing no indication of any attempt to balance its viewpoint with those of others.

Pgs. 233-235 list many topics regarding Arab-American studies and "notable" people; many of these have been associated with extremely anti-Semitic policies and actions. The topics and names of comparable or equivalent American Jewish topics and people appear nowhere in the proposed curriculum.

Pg. 239 proposes that teachers ask students to compare the experience of Latin American would-be immigrants to the U.S. to the experience of Palestinians and other Arabs at border crossings in Israel and the West Bank. This is presented as a valid comparison � yet no Latin Americans have *ever* attempted to bomb places in the U.S. nor to state that the U.S. has "no right to exist." The comparison is insulting and obviously biased.

In the words of Islamic scholar Tawfik Hamid, "Rejecting the State of Israel is related to the fact that it is a Jewish rather than a Muslim country. On several occasions I have asked Arab Muslims whether they would continue fighting Israel if its entire population converted to Islam. The answer is a unanimous "no." Then the problem has nothing to do with the land, as many claim, but with the Jewishness of the State of Israel." (emphasis added) This summarizes the lack of credibility of the BDS movement. The proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum should *in no way* condone a movement that advocates the destruction of a country. This curriculum, as it stands, does exactly that.

As a veteran educator, I value the importance of presenting students with balanced information, asking them to analyze and evaluate the facts, to form their own conclusions. This proposed curriculum fails in many important ways. Yes, of course Arabs, Muslims, and Americans of those heritages deserve respect and study. So do Jews - those who escaped Soviet Russia, those who suffered under Islamic rule in myriad countries, those whose families were annihilated in the Holocaust, as well as those who have experienced anti-Semitic actions in the United States. Among others, the Anti-Defamation League can provide ideas here. In fact, the ADL has many curriculum suggestions for teaching tolerance and understanding of myriad ethnic groups. In contrast, the BDS movement promotes hate and division. Surely our students deserve better guidance as they navigate their way in this world.
