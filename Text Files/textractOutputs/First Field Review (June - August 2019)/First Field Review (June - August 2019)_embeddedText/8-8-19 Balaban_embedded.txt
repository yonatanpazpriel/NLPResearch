I strongly oppose The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum referring to Palestinians and sanctions on Israel --not only for its shocking omission of any mention of Jewish Americans or anti-Semitism, or its blatant anti-Israel bias and praise of BDS, but also for its clear attempt to politically indoctrinate students to adopt the view that Israel and its Jewish supporters are part of `interlocking systems of oppression and privilege' that must be fought with `direct action' and `resistance.
The section on BDS presents "a single viewpoint on an extraordinarily complex international political dispute" and "singles out Israel -- the world's only Jewish state -- for special critique and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate.The curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry but is instead marginalizing Jewish students and fueling hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community.
The curriculum does not offer an Israeli Jewish perspective on the Middle East conflict.
