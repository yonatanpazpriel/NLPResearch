From: Michelle Sorkin Levy Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:02 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum ignores AGES of antisemitism!
I am opposed to the draft curriculum in its current form. It completely ignores the raging antisemitism in this country and excoriates the State of Israel which is the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people.
Jews have historically played a strong role as partners and advocates for disadvantaged groups and we will not allow our own trauma and struggles in America to be erased in history books.
I am outraged and demand that the State of CA give an accurate account of Jewish history and ethnicity.
