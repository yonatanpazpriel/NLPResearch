Please remove all anti-Israel bias from this framework. As a student currently in 12th grade, I want to be able to feel comfortable sending my future children to the schools I grew up in without the fear of them being taught hatred for their own identity. This section of the curriculum is partisan and demonizes the State of Israel, an ally and partner of the United States. Being a proud Californian and Israeli-American, I would never want to feel hated or discriminated against at my public school, and the inclusion of anti-Israel bias in curriculum would threaten my safety as a minority student. According to the ADL, anti-Semitic and antiIsrael hate crimes are the most frequent hate crime in the US and are only rising. It should be California leading the way on stopping this, not fueling it. As a student who has participated with the California Association of Student Council's Student Advisory Board on Education and a student who has started their own national student leadership organization, I intend to use all available platforms to bring attention to this blatant discrimination in California educational framework until it is resolved.

I also hope to see the addition of lessons about American Jews as an ethic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
