! would like to register my objections to the proposed curriculum for several reasons: (a) The Glossary of terms includes every form of prejudice except one--antisemitism, this despite the murder of 11 worshipers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh and a worshiper in Poway near San Diego. (b) The inclusion of the BDS movement as a form of "ethnic studies" contradicts CA law which prohibits any person or entity that engages in BDS from entering into a contract with the State of California. Likewise the recent vote of Congress against the use of BDS practices. (c) While ignoring antisemitism, the curriculum devotes substantial resources to teaching about Islamophobia, despite the fact that antisemitic incidents far outpace anti-Muslim incidents according to FBI statistics...the US Dept of Justice 2017 Hate Crime Statistics show 60% of hate crimes are against Jews. (d)As an entrepreneur, I object to capitalism being described as a "form of power and oppression" alongside "patriarchy" "racism" "white supremacy" and "ableism." In that vein, it describes subprime loans as an attack on home buyers with low incomes rather than a misguided attempt by the government to help such home buyers.
Others more eloquent than I have spoken out against the curriculum including state legislators and the Wall Street Journal. Thanks for listening. Art Zimmerman
