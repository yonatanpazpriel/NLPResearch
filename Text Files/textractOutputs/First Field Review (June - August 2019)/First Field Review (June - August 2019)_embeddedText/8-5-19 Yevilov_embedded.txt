, .URGENT ACTION NEEDED Stop Anti-Israel Hate in California Public Schools

freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions . It then parrots more BDS talking

points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end

Israel's existence.

2. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:

� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
� Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
� Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
� Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
� Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

3. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
