Line 366 This is typical anti-zionist rhetoric to label all Israelis as neocolonists without any even-handed treatment. Line 453 It is not a RACIAL conflict, but whoever put this curriculum together is not interested in discussing the complex middle east situation but only in presenting one side. The idea of offering BDS as a solution and making the entire middle east conflict a case of the good Palestinians against the evil Israelis is far left rhetoric of the worst kind. This entire curriculum is entirely prejudiced on the side of the far left and antiIsrael. It stokes anti-Semitism and should not be implemented.
