From: Noel Sanborn Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 1:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Honest History of Arab Americans is Important to California
I support the proposed curriculum for Arab studies in California universities. The curriculum should not be white washed by Pretending that Palestinians were not violently driven out of their homelands or pretending that Arabs and Muslims have not been demonized by the Israel lobby and by others in America. Then currently effort by pro-Apartheid groups to shut down the teaching of Arab studies in California is further evidence of the deliberate marginalization of Arabs in America by well funded groups such as Stand With Us that claim to be pro-Israel but are in reality racist and I democratic
