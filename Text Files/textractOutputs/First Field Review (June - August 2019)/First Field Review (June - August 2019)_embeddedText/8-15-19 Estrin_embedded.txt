Ethnic Studies ... The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression, including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia... Forms of oppression should also include anti-semitism. Please check the accuracy of the statement: "Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year."
It appears that Congress passed the 1924 Immigration Act to limit the number of immigrants that could be admitted to the U.S., especially from Southern and Eastern Europe. The Act set a quota of 2% of the total number of individuals from each nationality that resided in the United States in 1890 (before waves of Slavic and Italian immigrants arrived in America), and excluded Japanese immigrants. https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1901-1950/TheImmigration-Act-of-1924/ While the act severely limited immigration from many countries, It does not appear that there was a limit of 100 Arabs allowed to immigrate each year. https://herb.ashp.cuny.edu/items/show/1230

Please consider the fairness of using the word "Nakba" versus "Arab-Israeli War of 1948" as well as the historical context: ...The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War)....

The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 broke out when five Arab nations invaded territory in the former Palestinian mandate immediately following the announcement of the independence of the state of Israel on May 14, 1948. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 (also known as the Partition Resolution) that would divide Great Britain's former Palestinian mandate into Jewish and Arab states in May 1948. The Palestinian Arabs refused to recognize this arrangement. The United Nations resolution sparked conflict between Jewish and Arab groups within Palestine. .. The goal of the Arabs was initially to block the Partition Resolution and to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state. The Jews, on the other hand, hoped to gain control over the territory allotted to them under the Partition Plan. https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/arab-israeli-war
During the ensuing war, as many as 750,000 Palestinian Arabs fled their homes as a result of many factors. Some of the Palestinian Arabs who fled did so to avoid the ongoing war or at the urging of Arab leaders, and expected to return after a quick and certain Arab victory over the new Jewish state.
A Jewish refugee problem was also created with the establishment of the State of Israel. From 1948-1951 as many as 800,000 Jews were expelled from their native Arab and Muslim nations or forced to flee as a result of state-sponsored anti-Zionist violence... As many as 500,000 of these refugees fled from Iraq, Tunisia, Syria, Egypt, Yemen, Algeria, Libya and Morocco and were absorbed into the new State of Israel. Others fled to Europe and North and South America.

Ethnic Studies has created a space for all students to learn about and analyze their identities and hxrstories, feel proud of them, and actualize their full humanity.
Central to an Ethnic Studies pedagogy is the goal to develop students to be able to effectively and powerfully read, write, speak, think critically, and engage in school.

These skills are integral to students' ability to grasp and master content, engage in inquiry, and be active and well informed participants in society.

EXCELLENT! Students in California schools have diverse cultural backgrounds, primary languages, and needs. Students can increase self-awareness and tolerance by learning about each other's cultures, customs, and religions.
