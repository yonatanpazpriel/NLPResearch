It is absolutely ridiculous to teach that capitalism is racist when capitalism is probably the least racist of all economic and governmental systems. Capitalism and limited government go hand in hand and Adam Smith's 'invisible hand' insures that the best product at the best price with the best service will prevail regardless of the race of the person that produced it.
