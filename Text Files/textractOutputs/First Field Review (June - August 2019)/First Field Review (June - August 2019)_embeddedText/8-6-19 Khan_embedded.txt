Dear Curriculum Committee,
I have reviewed the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum and am impressed with its intersectionality, depth, and nuance. I enthusiastically support it, and I believe it will go a long way toward ending bigotry in our state and beyond.
Thank you for the opportunity,

Pages 231-286: As an educator who has spent most of my career working for inclusion and justice in K-12 and higher education, I enthusiastically support this detailed and well-researched sample curriculum for teaching about ArabAmerican communities. I grew up in a California in which such a curriculum did not exist and I was repeatedly subject to Islamophobia from teachers and classmates, not to mention the media. My son, who just graduated high school, also had similar painful experiences instigated by his classmates in a history class. I appreciate how this curriculum connects the Arab-American struggle with those of other marginalized communities. I believe it will go a long way in our multi-generational fight against racism and bigotry in our state and our country.
