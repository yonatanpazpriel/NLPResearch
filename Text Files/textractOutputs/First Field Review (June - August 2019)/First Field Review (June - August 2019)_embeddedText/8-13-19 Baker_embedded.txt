Ok, as a parent, I am very disturbed about hearing about what your "crazy" curriculum has in store for grade school and high school children. For these teachers to be allowed to teach (or RANT) about things they know nothing about just so they can remain LIBERAL is absurd.
The agenda to advocating violence and a socialism, saying Capitalist are "racist" and that Israel should not even exist. This is absolutely unbelievable. These types of teachers should be interviewed before becoming a teacher. Don't they know that this country was actually "founded" on Capitalism?? That's how much they know.
So PLEASE discontinue this curriculum that is currently "in the works". Do it for your state of CA AND for our country. Please wake up.
Sincerely,
T. Baker
