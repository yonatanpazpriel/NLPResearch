First, this entire curriculum is Jew-hating. It might as well have been written by the Muslim Brotherhood. Invite the Jewish Caucus and Jewish leaders to participate in a completely new revamped draft.

Secondly, the entire draft is pro-illegal immigrant and anti-citizen. Whose country do you represent: every country in the world, or the United States of America?

Thirdly, the curriculum is completely biased according to your opinions. Make it neutral and let the students come to their own conclusions.

The Muslim Julie Steele Ban Executive private individual Order 13769

Do not title it "Muslim Ban." That is your opinion, not fact. For instance, it did not ban Muslims from Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Egypt. The majority of Muslims from around the world were still welcome.

It only suspended entry for 90 days of those from countries who did not meet adjudication standards under U.S. immigration law: Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.

Call it by its formal name: "Executive Order 13769" or "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States." Let the students come to their own assessment of its meaning.

This call is completely one-sided. Learn history:
Israel gained control of the Palestinian territory in defensive wars. Israel was originally granted this territory by the League of Nations; thus, they hold the most current legal title to the Palestinian territory. If a country gains land, originally granted to it, in a defensive war, it is not "occupying" the territory.

In 1948, Israel was invaded by 5 Arab armies. It was a defensive war.

In 1967, the Egyptians blocked the Tiran straits for Israeli ships, which was a casus beli (an act that justifies going to war). Israel fought against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. Then Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, and other countries contributed troops and arms. So, it was at least 8 countries against 1: defensive war.

In 1973, Israel was jointly attacked by Egypt and Syria, on the Jewish most holy day of Yom Kippur. Defensive war.
