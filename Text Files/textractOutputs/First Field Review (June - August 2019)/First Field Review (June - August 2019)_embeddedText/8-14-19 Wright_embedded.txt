From: Beth Wright Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am very opposed to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I read through the available chapters on the website and there are many problems with it. Rewriting everything to get rid of genders is ridiculous. Saying that Capitalism is evil is untrue. There are many digs against family, being patriotic, even being American. It seems that the curriculum is devised to speak against the family unit, the country we live in, the founding principles that our country was founded upon.
Again, I am very opposed to this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
