I am against this proposal. I think it promotes hate and division. Instead of dividing people into groups, the schools should teach World History, American History, California History, and yes, Western Civilization. These should be taught with truth, the good and bad in all people all cultures. From what I see in your report, this is nothing more than teaching hatred of white people. The fact that you include capitalism as a bad thing speaks volumes. This is nothing more than leftist propaganda. If this goes through, you will have more taxpayers leaving the state. California already has the highest level of income inequality because it encourages the middle class to leave. (Along with many businesses.) How many businesses will want to open in CA, if it's future is based on racist propaganda? The values in your proposal are very screwed up. Martin Luther King, Jr. dreamed of a time when we would have a race free society, when people would not be judged by the color of their skin. Ethnic Studies does just the opposite, it divides everyone by skin color and makes a mockery of the American culture. DO NOT PASS THIS, STOP THE HATED, DON'T PROMOTE IT.
