For Your Attention.
To: Tony Thurmond Soo-Min Chao Linda Darling-Hammond Steve Glazer Rebecca Bauer Kahan
We are appalled by the direction taken by the state education establishment to sow divisiveness among the diverse population of the Great State of California. The latest evidence that rather than seeking to unify our community, the education establishment is seeking a curriculum to teach our young hatred and division. Although other ethnic and racial groups are similarly affected, the Jews are particularly targeted in this 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, from which the following examples are cited:
1. The draft curriculum omits any discussion of antisemitism and the discrimination and hate directed at Jewish Americans in the past and present, exemplified in the recent surge of violent antisemitic incidents.
2. The draft curriculum discusses the displacement of Palestinians without providing the context and facts associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It refers to "the Nakba" but never mentions the Holocaust or the need for a Jewish state, nor does it discuss the violence preceding the Israeli War of Independence, which continues to this day.
3. The draft curriculum condemns Israel and justifies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement which, as you of course know, is widely perceived by the Jewish community as discrimination against Jews and Israelis. Instead, it likens the BDS movement to a civil rights movement.
We sincerely hope this seriously flawed document will be dropped from consideration and instead a new document will be developed, based on an honest exploration of the values that make people from around the world want to come to this country. Our own young generation should learn to appreciate the same values and not be indoctrinated with poisonous misinformation which uses Jews as scapegoats for the world's problems. Please do the right thing and start over.
Sincerely,
