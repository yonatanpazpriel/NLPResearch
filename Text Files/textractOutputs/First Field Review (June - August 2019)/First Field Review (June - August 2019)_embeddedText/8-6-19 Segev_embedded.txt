Pages 233-234 � Lines 4956, 4957, 4958 I am a great believer in the importance of Ethnic Studies. I think it's important for our students to think, ask, and challenge. But the outrageous inclusion of topics like "Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel" or a comparison between the Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter is a pure politization of our curriculum and an irresponsible association of a century-old political, religious, and nationalistic conflict with the so-called Ethnic Studies plan. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict belongs in international relations studies or in the history of the middle east course. Trying to use Ethnic Studies curriculum as a cover for the Palestinian narrative is wrong, irresponsible, and misleading. Singling out the Palestinian experience and drawing lines between it and the Black Lives Matter is nothing but politization of the school system. It is so obvious the people behind the curriculum have no intention whatsoever to present a balanced and well-rounded story, a look at the "in no way exhaustive" recommended figures to cover only illustrates the one-sided nature of the effort and its lack of any educational integrity. I call the commission to remove any politicized contamination of the curriculum and stick with what it intended to do � teach our kids about the history, the hardships, and the ways to overcome ethnic discrimination.

Page 2 � Lines 27-31 Antisemitism, anyone? The curriculum draft doesn't find it necessary to recognize antisemitism as a leading form of hatred, racism, and bigotry?!
