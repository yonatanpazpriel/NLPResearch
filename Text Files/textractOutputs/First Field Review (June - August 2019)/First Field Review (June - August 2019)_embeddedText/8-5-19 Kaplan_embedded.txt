As an American/Californian Jew I consider this document deeply flawed by being racist/anti-Semitic. First, there is no goal of discussing antiSemitism among other ethnic experiences (p.2) and not even mentioning of anti-Semitism in the Model's Glossary. Second, there is expansive biased discussions of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the BDS movement. There is another side to the Conflict; either it should be presented to the students, or even better, totally exluded from the Curriculum
