I respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel and antiSemitic bias from the model curriculum on pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 as well as from the Glossary page 2 lines 30 through 40.

I strongly urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union as well as those who assisted the formation of this country.

I would like emphasize the value of inclusion and how BDS promotes hate and division by spreads falsehoods about Jews and Israel.

This new proposed curriculum make me, as a parent of school children, feel marginalized, unimportant, threatened, and targeted by those who seek to silence or remove me and my family from California. My son, a current middle school student, has experienced first-hand the effects of this anti-Semitism. This course will only exacerbate these problems, which I believe is contrary to what your goals are.
