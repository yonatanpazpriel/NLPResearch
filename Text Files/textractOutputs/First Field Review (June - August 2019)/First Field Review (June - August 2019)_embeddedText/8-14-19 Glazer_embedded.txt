I am appalled at what I am seeing being proposed for the mandatory ethnic studies program in our great State of California. I am member of a family which served our country in World War II and had two friends who lost their uncles while serving in the Army during the War. I have taken care of many poor young African-Americans who have been shot and poor veterans in need. Never in my life did I ever expect to see a state sanctioned curriculum that would view capitalism as racism and be as virulently anti-semitic as any Nazi publication. While I am for diversity, it doesn't mean I am for any learning material that vilifies only one country, Israel, and fosters state sanctioned anti-semitism. We don't need any more hate leading to possible violence in our state.When I arrived in California 40 years ago it was a great place with a great education system. Now numerous public schools are substandard and it is more important to indoctrinate children politically than to teach them math and science.What is this, PRAVDA?
How could something this awful have gotten so far?
Please correct this.
Sincerely,
Howard Glazer MD
