8-7-19
To Whom it May Concern: I understand the California Legislature is considering bills to create an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum -- which may be either optional or even mandatory for public schools, depending on which bill is passed. And as part of this bill, it seems that course material will be proposed or even required which is radically racist and specifically antisemitic in nature. It is reported that the material being proposed to be taught to innocent children throughout the state of California lies about this history of Israel, promotes the causes of known and admitted racists and hate-mongers, completely omits teaching children about the ancient and endless history of antisemitism and its radical resurgence in modern-day America, and even promotes the radically racist movement known as "BDS". Germany, with its vast historical knowledge of antisemitism, and the U.S. Congress, and many states have formally recognized the obviously bigoted nature of the "BDS movement"--so how could any division of the State of California be considering a full-blown push to support this form of bigotry-especially as it leads so easily to violence? I've lived in California for 43 years, had the honor of working at the California Supreme Court, and have seen a lot of
political movements come and go over time, but this is the most bigoted and ignorant thing I've ever seen California state officials consider. I pray you do not make this kind of irreversible mistake and side with those wanting to lead the children of this state down a path of blind hatefulness. Please change direction before you do more damage than any of us can even imagine. - Bob Weinberg
