Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned about the proposed and flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I grew up in the United States at a time when Jews were not allowed to buy homes where they wished, could not be admitted to restaurants, hotels, or any facility which chose to discriminate at will. The colleges I applied to had quotas for Jews. Our country denied immigration to many of my people and sent them back to Europe to die.
Today my grandchildren attend a synagogue protected by security guards and the adults worry about their safety. I never thought there would be gun men who entered a synagogue and shot the congregants. I never thought I would see a rise in Neo Nazi groups and the KKK. But that is our current reality. It frightens me and my children and my grandchildren.
Hate is rising in our country. We are increasingly divided. To exclude the history and current experience of anti-semitism in your curriculum creates a divided, prejudiced curriculum that will feed the hatred. Please present a curriculum that encourages all points of view and supports integration not division and hatred.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Susan L Markowitz Menlo Park, California
