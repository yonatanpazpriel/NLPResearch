To Whom It May Concern,
I am shocked that the California Department of Education would even consider a proposal to demonize the Jewish people. Hasn't that happened enough already throughout history? Is our state now going to fill our children's heads with the hateful lies about the Jews living in Israel? They aren't bloodthirsty villains, victimizing Palestinians. Do some REAL research.
Yes, there are conflicts at the Gaza border, but those are initialed by Hamas, telling their citizens to throw rocks, send balloons with incendiary devices over the border to cause massive fires, and sneak into Israel to murder whenever they can find a victim. Israel has the right to respond and defend their citizens.
Yet, you find it fitting to pass on the lies about Jewish people to our kids here in California, just like those that creates the next generation of haters in Gaza and other areas? It will not only cause our children to hate Israelis, it will also cause them to hate Jewish people everywhere.
My husband and I traveled to Israel and went all over the country, speaking to Christians, Jews and Muslims. They all love living there. Many of them, including gays and women, who felt their lives were better (safer) in Israel.
I strongly suggest that you travel to Israel and see for yourself that there are Palestinians living, being educated and being employed just like their Jewish neighbors without a problem. They are all considered Israeli citizens.
Please do not vote for this new "education" as it is nothing more then propaganda.
Sincerely, Yvonne May
