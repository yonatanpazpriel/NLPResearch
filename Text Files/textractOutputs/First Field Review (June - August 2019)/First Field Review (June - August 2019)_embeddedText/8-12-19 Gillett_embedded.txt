Re: ethnic studies SB 48
Parts of this curriculum are unacceptable.
We need ethnic studies, BUT Capitalism described as a form of power and oppression, patriarchy, racism, white supremacy and ableism is ridiculous. Why are Capitalism and capitalists villains in this document, when Capitalism supports the ethnic groups we are trying to educate?
Suggesting that Capitalism is Racist is irresponsible and unsupportable. OUR CAPITALIST SYSTEM OF JOB CREATION GIVES US A TAX BASE TO FUND SOCIAL POGRAMS!! Did any of you have 3rd grade arithmetic or basic economic history??? We need ethnic studies, but let's not waste our student's precious learning time with such objectionable nonsense.
This is a lack of critical thinking --young people must learn to make rational decisions, and the psychobabble in much of this curriculum is objectionable, contributes nothing to student learning critical skills, and parts are a careless waste of our precious educational resources and squander our children's learning opportunities.
Yes--do ethnic studies. No-Don't dilute them with irresponsible rhetoric. (And, the bias is obvious--there are some very impressive minorities other than the 60s who are not even mentioned here) Come on, we can do better than this. C Gillett ï¿½San Mateo, Ca (past teacher)
