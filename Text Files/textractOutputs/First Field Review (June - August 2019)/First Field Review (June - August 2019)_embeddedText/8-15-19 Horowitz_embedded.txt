Ms. Soomin Chao Chair, Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education Sacramento, CA
Dear Ms. Chao:
Thank you for creating a curriculum that reminds all of us that Jews conquered the Palestinian state and turned it into a concentration camp. Don't let the jew owned media like the Washington Post (Jeff Bezos of Amazon is a crypto jew).
Many people think your curriculum was just a mistake and that you didn't understand what you were doing. I KNOW THEY ARE WRONG ! YOU ARE NOT THAT STUPID !! NO ONE IS !!
You are a brave, intelligent Aryan warrior and you stood up against the 1% who truly control the world.
Fight them, boycott them, reinstate the Palestinian country that was there for hundreds of years before the jew invaders took it over.
Don't back down. The truth will make you free !
Daniel Horowitz
