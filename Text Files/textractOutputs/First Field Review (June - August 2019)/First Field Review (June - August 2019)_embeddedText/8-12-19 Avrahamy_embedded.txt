To whom it may concern:
I am a graduate of Fairfax High School which is part of the LA Unified School District and I am shocked and appalled by the new curriculum that is being proposed for California students. I am a child of a refugee who was kicked out of Iraq and fled to the State of Israel. My father and his family was one of close to a million Jewish refugees who were persecuted in Arab lands after the establishment of the Jewish homeland and was taken in by Israel as refugees. My family's story will not be included in your one sided anti Israel and anti Semitic curriculum. Students in California public schools will likely be taught a skewed anti-Semitic revisionist version of "history" to try and paint Israel as a colonialist nation that persecuted its Arab population. This sort of curriculum will be purely anti Semitic and will falsely portray the Jewish nation as villains.
As a graduate of the California public schools and a tax paying resident of California, I ask that you not adopt the proposed anti Israel/anti Semitic curriculum.
