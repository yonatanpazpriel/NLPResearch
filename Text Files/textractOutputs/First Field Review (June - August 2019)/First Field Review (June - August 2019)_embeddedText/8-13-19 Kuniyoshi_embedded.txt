I appreciate your desire to help fight bigotry and racism with a more inclusive new ethnic studies curriculum for California schools.
I am a parent of proud brown children -- Puerto Rican and Okinawan and Jewish. Yes, Jewish. And I want my children to attend school in an environment where they will feel valued for all these aspects to their multi-ethnic identity.
Unfortunately, it seems like your curriculum will marginalize my children just for being Jews. I want to see co-equal Israel and Palestine, living side by side in peace. I actively support dialogue and want them to be educated about the nuances of the conflict. Just like I would want them to be educated as to the nuances of the conflict between Okinawa and Japan, or Puerto Rico and the United States. Because nuances matter.
When I was growing up in NYC, I was marginalized for being Puerto Rican. I would hate for my children to have to go through the pain and heartache that I did, especially when the curriculum purports to make everyone count and feel respected in California.
Please consider the nuances here. Not all Jews are "white" or wealthy or enjoy all of the other privileges you think we do. Another nuance: Just like not all Americans support marginalizing brown people, not all Israelis support occupation -- so many of them are actually fighting for a co-equal state for Palestinians.
Please consider expanding this curriculum to truly exemplify the inclusive learning we all can be proud of. Everyone -- including my children -- counts.
Thank you, Monica Rodriguez Kuniyoshi
