Somos Sur" is a song off Ana Tijoux's latest album "Vengo". This song is Anti-USA and The home of weapons needs to be destroyed. We all live in the USA and to bring in a song that advocates the discretion of this country is not right. Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system ." This is wrong. Under capitalism ALL PEOPLE have the ability to provide a product and service regardless of race. Capitalism was brought more freedom and prosperity to the world then any other system.

Page 233 exposed to how Arab Americans, along with non-Arab Muslims, South Asians, Sikhs, and others, have suffered from being perceived as a domestic enemy in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. These negative sentiments toward Arab Americans stem primarily from ignorance, but they also reflect a troubled relationship between the US and the Arab world as a result of US imperialism. This is wrong. The 9/11 attack was not from US imperialism. It was from the Ideas of Islam. Islam teaches to kill the Jews and infidels and by doing so you will go to Heaven Quran 4:74, 9:111, Sahih Bukhari (52:54) Sahih Muslim (20.4635) -. To blame 9/11 on the USA is just wrong!!!!!!!!!

Page 245 Arabs and Latinos are the same "The increased militarization of the US-Mexico border also reflects the connection between the issues of the two communities. Large defense companies like Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, and Northrup Grumman are scrambling to secure contracts to provide weaponry, including drones, for the border to make up for the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan." The board wall and enforcing the laws of the USA has nothing to do with the draw down from Afghanistan. Whoever wrote are is wrong.

There are so many thing wrong with this lesson plan. I wish I don't work so much, so I could go thought is line by line.. You NEED to get some subjective people to reread this.
