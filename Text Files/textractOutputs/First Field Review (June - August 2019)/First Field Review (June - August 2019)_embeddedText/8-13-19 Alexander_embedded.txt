From: cottons Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 12:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please NO
NO on teaching our kids that Capitalism is racist and leaning toward socialistic. I did leave a message also saying Calif's education is ranked LOW!!! Think we're 48th!? Bad teachers, over crowding (with all the illegal kids who can't speak English etc...) Told them I'm a NO vote!
Sincerely
Robert & Judith Alexander
