After reading your model curriculum regarding Ethnic Studies, I am requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Also urge inclusion of lessons of American Jews as an Ethnic group including those who fled the Holocaust and discrimination and oppression of the Middle East and in the former Soviet Union.

A Pro-Palestinian bias and total criticism of Israel in several sample lesson plans does not afford a full and honest perspective of both groups. This is not an honest rendering of history. Lessons need to present both perspectives.
