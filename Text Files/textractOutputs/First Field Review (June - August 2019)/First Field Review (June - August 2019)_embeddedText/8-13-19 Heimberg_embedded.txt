From: Karen Schloss Heimberg Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies should include Anti Semitism!
Research shows that culturally meaningful and relevant curriculum can have a positive impact on students. Students that become more engaged in school through courses like ethnic studies have higher graduation rates, better attendance and feel more personally empowered. Ethnic studies also gives students an appreciation of the contributions of multiple cultures, creating future global citizens.
While properly including a vast array of other evils in the propose d curriculum, they exclude from it any discussion of ant -semitism and any discussion of the contributions of Jewish Americans to our State and Nation.
Even worse, as part of their curriculum on Arab Americans, they include a reference to the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, describing it as "a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." If you agree with me that a curriculum that the California legislature mandated be de signed to "prepar[e] pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures" has no business taking sides in an extremely complicated and nuanced conflict in the Middle East.
Thank you in advance,
