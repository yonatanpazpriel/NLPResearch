From: David Apfelberg Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 3:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the Instructional Quality Commission California Board of Education, As an American Jewish citizen, I am expressing my concern about the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The ostensible purpose of California's new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is to build a shared understanding of ethnic group's perspectives and engage minority students in school, but it is replete with anti-Semitic ideas, one-sided BDS bias, and demonization of Israel. Crucially, there is no mention of anti-Semitism. In addition, many sections in the ESMC are inaccurate, misleading and unbalanced. For example: � Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned � Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews � The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective � A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included The importance of describing the Jewish situation is that there has been an alarming rise of antiSemitism on many American college campuses as well as a documented increase of hate crimes against the Jews. Jews are being increasingly targeted in many areas in the press and in mass media as well as "dark media". The FBI has documented a large increase in anti-Semitic incidents in the U. S. Please make major revisions or a significant rewrite of ESMC, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, and Jimena, Amcha, and others. Sincerely, David B. Apfelberg, M.D
