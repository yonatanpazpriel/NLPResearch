From: Ross Marlowe Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 11:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Feedback from a parent
Good morning,
Can we please allow our children to learn these things in the home.
School is a place to learn the the facts about how our constitution works, how math works and how to read and write.
Please leave politics out of it.
This is why so many parents are moving or choosing to home school.
Please do not indoctrinate my children.
Thank you
