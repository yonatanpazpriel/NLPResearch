I agree with the general idea of teaching Ethnic Studies. In this case, I am concerned that we are looking at texts that have as their goal maintaining ethnic divisions and empowering individual ethnicities. How do we compare the vision of a melting pot when we want each of the individual elements to maintain their shape and consistency?

What is the common goal of an Ethnic Studies program? What is the society we are trying to build?

It is clear to me that individuals value their ethnic origins and heritage as a foundation of where they come from and who they are now? But, where are the bi-racial, the integrational, the people who see their ethnic origin as a blend to start with? I think this is missing from the text.

Multi-racial heritage is one area that is missing. Another is inconvenient ideas, such as anti-semitism. It comes up in places that list historic issues, but not current issues.

Glossary and Bibliography

The Glossary and Bibliography are problematic, in that they incorporate terms such as accompliceship and allyship that frame a reference point that again aims at maintaining ethnic divisions as a goal of ethnic studies.
I will point out the focus on BDS in the Glossary and Bibliography is problematic. The ongoing conflict in the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean involves primary antagonists who have not found a path to peace. Each side has claims. Each side has supporters. Each side has apologists. BDS supports one side and denies the claim of the other. I do not believe it is the job of the State of California to legitimize the claim of one side and not even teach content about the other.
What is Accompliceship? What is Allyship? What is marginalized? There are terms being used here that need clarification, tied into my general overview.
The description of "Assimilation" says that a group has been "Marginalized". I don't believe that to be correct. Let's say people who have come to this country from Italy moved to New York. They spoke Italian among each other, but they seek to build their businesses and sell to more customers. They want their children to have an education. There are plenty of customers who speak English, and English is taught in the schools. Should the majority of people be expected to learn Italian and speak to the new immigrants so they can keep teaching their children Italian, sell their wares to a large number of English-speaking customers who have learned Italian as a second language? Or, will the Italians, who have a community and neighborhood of other Italian immigrants, start to learn English so they can expand their business and have a better life?
Where is the definition of religious discrimination? Islamophobia is listed. Why not Anti-Semitism? Why not hatred of Catholics, Hindus. What about ethnic hatreds that continue to be espoused in this country?
Again, I think there needs to be a clarification - what is the intent of the curriculum? Do we believe that sensitivity of our society to ethnic origin and

history is to build trust as we create a melting pot? Or is to focus on maintaining rigid ethnic identities that do not bend within our society?
