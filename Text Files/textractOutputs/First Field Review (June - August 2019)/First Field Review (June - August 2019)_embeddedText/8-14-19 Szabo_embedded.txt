As a child of holocaust survivors and high level taxpayer I am sad to hear of the insensitive changes proposed as standard curriculum for the children of our wonderful state.
In no way should the anti Semitic beliefs of johnson, montano and shoman be allowed to propagate among our children. A twisting of these complex issues into unfounded condemnation of the only real democracy in the Middle East is also anti American and anti Californian.
It is time to strike out the sections of the curriculum changes that copy Hamas talking points that are frank lies and propaganda and hide the real truth about the causes of conflict in the Middle East: namely, the intransigence of states neighboring Israel in refusing to negotiate a peace because they cynically use of the existence of the State of Israel to divert public attention from the atrocities the dictators of these neighboring states are committing against their own peoples.
