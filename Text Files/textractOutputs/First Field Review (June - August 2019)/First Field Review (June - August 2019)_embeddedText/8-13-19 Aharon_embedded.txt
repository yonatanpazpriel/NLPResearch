Comparing Black people to Palestine insults the black people tradition and history. I have never heard on any black leader who called to kill/attack white people like Arabs leaders do. I did not hear about any Black organization who pays money to families whose family member attacked White people. Palestine leadership calls to eliminate Israel, Palestine authorities pays monthly payments to terrorist family who killed Israeli people.

PLEASE DO NOT INVOVLE POLITICS IN EDUCATION I do not want my kids to learn to hate and be aggressive against other. Israel population is 8M surrounded by 400M Arabs who hates Israel because it represents something different (Democratic western culture). I do not think that CA wants to educate their children to harm democracy and freedom

This is a faulty propaganda, there is nothing in common between the Palestine situation to the Mexican border. American - Mexican border is between 2 states, the Mexican immigration is mainly for work, the border between Israel to Palestine is mainly to prevent attack against population.
