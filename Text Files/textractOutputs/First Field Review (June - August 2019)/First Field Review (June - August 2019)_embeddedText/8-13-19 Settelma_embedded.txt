Based on the outlines provided at https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/esmcpubliccomment.asp?mod=article_inline, our family has grave concerns with the real intent of this study. It in itself looks to be pretty one sided, and racist in itself. Most of the topics in this course should be presented and discussed at the family level. There is too much room to be subjective and try to influence children based on the teachers view. This is not the responsibility of the school, but of the mother and father. Our children will not be taking this course, even if the school attempts to mandate such propaganda. Please remember that we are a democratic country, not a communist regime that controls all education and try to run peoples lives.
