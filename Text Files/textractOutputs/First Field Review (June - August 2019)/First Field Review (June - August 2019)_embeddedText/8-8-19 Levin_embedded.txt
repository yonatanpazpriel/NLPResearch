From: Abby Levin Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 5:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Question about Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Hi,
I have been looking through the Ethnic Studies model curriculum and I see many ethnic minorities focused on. I do not see any focus on Jewish Americans. We are considered both an ethnic group and a minority religion. With the rise of white supremacy and white nationalism, there has been an increase in anti/semitism locally, nationally, and globally.
Question: Where in this long and diverse curriculum are Jewish American brought up and anti-semitism?
Question: If Jewish American are left out of ethnic studies, why is that?
Question: Where does the curriculum address the specific challenges of minority religions and the difficult choices they just make (examples: an exam is given on one of their religious holidays where they are supposed to spend the day at their place of worship or everyone assumes they celebrate a religious holiday (Christmas) that is not from their religious tradition.)
I went to California Public schools kindergarten through college. Graduating high-school class of 1991. I experience anti-semitiam at school and would hope that an ethnic studies curriculum would seek to bring tolerance for all minority. Unfortunately, antisemitism is on the rise.
Thank you, Abby Levin Contra Costa County, CA
