From: Steven Medetsky Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 7:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Bill AB 331 And The Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear California Board Of Education and State Legislators,
I urge you to remove the Ethnic Studies Curriculum, from Bill AB 331. I hear that it supports the BDS Movement, this is a bias, historically inaccurate movement. It calls for the destruction of Israel, one of the U.S.'s closest allies and the ONLY Democracy in the Middle East. In addition, I understand the aforementioned curriculum, does not include anti-semitism, but it does reference other races and persons.
Thank you
Steven Medetsky
