Dear Administrator,
I am writing to protest the adoption by the Department of Education of its proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. In my opinion, the Proposed curriculum is objectionable as both anti Jewish and anti Israel.
Such an inaccurate and biased curriculum has no place in California.
Thank you for your consideration.
