I am strongly opposed to the approval of the proposed Ethnic Studies Guidelines.
As a teacher in CULVER CITY UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT for several decades I know how important it is to present apolitical material or balanced representations of conflicting points of view.
Although I have not yet been able to review the entire document myself, I have read the specific quotes provided by STAND WITH US. These specific objections indicate a lack of representation of a Jewish view of history or the present.
Please do not approve an anti Semitic set of curricular guidelines. We need greater UNITY, not greater Divisiveness.
