Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission:
On behalf of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC) and 6 other organizations, I submit the attached comment for two purposes:
1. To urge you to protect the movement and progress of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum; and
2. To provide comments on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, specifically on the Asian American history section, to include a much more comprehensive curriculum of the diverse Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in California.
SEARAC is a national civil rights organization that empowers Cambodian, Hmong, Laotian, and Vietnamese American communities to create a socially just and equitable society. As a group of organizations working nationwide for educational justice and equity, SEARAC and the undersigned organizations applaud the California Department of Education's effort to implement AB 2016 (Alejo) in a timely manner by convening an Ethnic Studies Advisory Committee and developing a draft of the model curriculum. We urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum despite uninformed opposition from some media and other specialized interest groups.
We believe that California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum must be robust and reflect the diverse populations that make up California, including the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities, so that school districts can pull curricula of relevant communities into their classrooms. We therefore request that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum include the critical content we describe in our attached comment.
For questions or more information, please contact Quyen Dinh, Executive Director, at quyen@searac.org, or Anna Byon, Education Policy Advocate, at anna@searac.org.
Sincerely, Anna Byon
