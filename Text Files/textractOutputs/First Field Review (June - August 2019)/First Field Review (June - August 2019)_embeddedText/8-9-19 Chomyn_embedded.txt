Dear committee,
I am not Jewish, but I fear for Jews in our country and abroad. They are tiny minority, 12-15 million in the world, with a tiny homeland surrounded by hostile nations and people. Yet antisemitism is rising at an enormous and terrifying rate here and especially abroad. Some of our university campuses are among the most inhospitable places for Jews nowadays, because of the anti-Zionist activism conducted largely by Students for Justice in Palestine and because Middle East Studies and Gender Studies departments have faculty that are strongly proPalestinian and anti-Israel. There are other insidious elements at work as well, contributing to this atmosphere, which I won't go into. Jewish students are afraid to hold pro-Israel events on campus (and if they do, those events are often shut down by SJP), and sometimes the students are even afraid to identify themselves as Jewish.
Please do not let such an anti-semitic atmosphere spread to our high schools. Jews have much reason to be proud of their heritage, but students will struggle with doubt when anti-semitic and anti-Israel propaganda is presented to them as being in line with progressive values. SJP and BDS are anything BUT liberal. Please ensure that the ethnic studies curriculum represents all ethnic groups fairly and that political agendae, like the delegitimization of Israel and the elimination of Jewish history, are not embedded in the curriculum.
Sincerely, Anne Chomyn, Ph.D.

Incredibly biased against Israel, and not even suggesting that Jews, arguably the most persecuted people on earth, and certainly the ethnicity that has suffered the greatest genocide, are an ethnicity worth studying. Jews are victims of the most hate crimes based on religion in this country (and maybe in the world), suffering double the number that Muslims suffer. Arabs and African American get a great deal of attention in this document, as these two groups were chosen as topics of sample curricula, and Asian and Latino and Filipino were mentioned as possible other topics. Arab studies was included as a topic as "a direct response to specific concerns of representation by Arab American and Pacific Islander communities." Chapter 2, lines19-21). Was there any consideration or input from Jewish communities? It is widely acknowledged that antisemitism is on the rise here and abroad, and if any cultural group needed defense from bigotry, it is the Jewish people, not so much the Arabs.

There is an unacceptable misrepresentation of BDS as a human rights movement. It is not. It is a movement to discredit, denigrate, delegitimize, and ultimately destroy Israel (Chapter 4, lines 30-40). The words of the founder of BDS: "Good riddance! The two-state solution for the Palestinian-Israeli conflict is finally dead. But someone has to issue an official death certificate before the rotting corpse is given a proper burial and we can all move on and explore the more just, moral and therefore enduring alternative for peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs in Mandate Palestine: the one-state solution."-Omar Bargouti.

The document is beyond editing. You need to start over with a development team that is less biased against Jews and Israel than the one that created this document, and in particular, you need to remove Samia Shomun, who taught at SFSU, arguably the most anti-semitic campus in the country.
