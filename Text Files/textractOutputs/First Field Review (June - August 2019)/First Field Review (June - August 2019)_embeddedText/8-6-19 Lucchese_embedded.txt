ï¿½ I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.
It is past time for Arab studies to be highlighted in your ethnic studies curriculum. With a topic awash in historic misinformation, students could only benefit from these classes.
Please inform me if this does not constitute a valid comment to be considered. Thank you, Mary Lucchese MD
