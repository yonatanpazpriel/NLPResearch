This curriculum is monstrously anti-semitic. From its bizarre and calculated omission of Jews as an ethnic group that exists in the United States, to its explicit endorsement of the "boycott divestment and sanctions" organization whose aim is to destroy the State of Israel, it indoctrinates a false and appalling worldview, positing Jews as a dangerous enemy of people of color, that has no place in the American classroom. (see page 2 and 10 of the glossary). This curriculum's blanket condemnation of "capitalism", without any reference to the effects that alternate economic systems such as Communism have actually had upon the citizens of various regimes who have tried them, are misleading, erroneous and alarmingly ignorant of world history. The word "Communism" is not even mentioned in the glossary! This curriculum's insistence on notions of oppression and grievance, to the exclusion of any pride in what the US has given the world or acknowledgement of the advantages that being American gives us all, is a poor foundation for education, citizenship, achievement, ambition, or understanding of past and present geopolitical realities.
