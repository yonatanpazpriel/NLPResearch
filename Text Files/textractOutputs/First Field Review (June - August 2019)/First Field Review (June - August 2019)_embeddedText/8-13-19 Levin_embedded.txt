From: Steve Levin On Behalf Of Steve Levin Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the Instructional Quality Commission, California Board of Education,
I am deeply concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies model curriculum. I am actually a huge advocate for ethnic studies, but this important effort must be inclusive of all ethnic groups who struggle with acts of discrimination and hate speech. Anti-semitism, including attacks on Jews and synagogues, is on the rise, and our state would be remiss in not providing a balanced and nuanced view of the IsraeliPalestinian dilemma and the historic pattern of anti-semitism.
I have reviewed the curriculum on your website, and there is much to admire. However, I ask for major revisions of the Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter and other Jewish organizations who simply seek for the Jewish ethnic experience to be included in a balanced way.
There is no question that Jews have been a historically oppressed people, and omission of Jews as one of many ethnic groups in our State is a serious error. There are many knowledgeable and fair-minded resources in the Jewish community to help create an accurate, sensitive and relevant portrayal of the Jewish experience in the curriculum. Please include these voices!
Regards, Steve Levin
