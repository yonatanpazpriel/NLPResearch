From: Dorothy Loving Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concerned citizen
Dear Sir/Madam:
Thank for your service to California's public school students. As a military spouse I have placed my children in several school systems and am very impressed with the education in this state.
I am concerned with the political angle of the proposed Ethnic studies models. I believe we cannot hide from the facts of history and need to teach the good, the bad, and the ugly. However, my children belong to groups that are going to be categorized as "oppressors." While they need to understand the history of our country, I don't want them to feel marginalized as if they share in a collective guilt. My concern is that the way the material may be taught might be divisive and my suggestion is to make the curriculum more informative and less political.
Thank you for reading this and taking my concern into account.
Sincerely,
Dorothy J. Loving
