Perhaps it is just an oversight, but it seems that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ignores the challenges that have been faced, and are still faced, by Jewish Americans. Anti-semitism remains an evil to be reckoned with today, as it did when Jews first immigrated to the U.S., as is most recently evidenced by the killings that took place at the Chabad synagogue in Poway, California this past April, and at the Tree of Life synagogue located in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in October 2018.
