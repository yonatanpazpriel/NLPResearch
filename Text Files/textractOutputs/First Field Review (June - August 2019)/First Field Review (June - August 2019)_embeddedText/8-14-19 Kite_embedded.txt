From: Dennis Kite Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Why do you include BDS materials in curriculum for students, and not mention anti_Semitism?
BDS is an organization founded by terrorists who are anti-Jew and Anti-Israel. They are not protesting terrible human rights violations promulgated by countries with despicable human rights records such as China, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Sudan, Libya, Syria, Iraq, Myanmar, etc. They only target Israel, the one true democracy in the Middle East. That is prejudicial and hateful. This is surrendering to the evils of left wing propaganda, pure and simple. You should be ashamed of yourselves as educators when all you are doing is promoting propaganda and distortions of facts. I highly object to teaching California students from a prejudiced and untruthful point of view.
