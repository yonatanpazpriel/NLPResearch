From: Sammy Ahdoot Date: Mon, Aug 12, 2019 at 11:00 AM Subject: Greetings / 2020 Ethnic Studies Curriculum To:
To whom it my concern. In response to your call for public comment on the draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, I am submitting the following input ; Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointing that the draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel.
Thank you for your consideration and cooperation
