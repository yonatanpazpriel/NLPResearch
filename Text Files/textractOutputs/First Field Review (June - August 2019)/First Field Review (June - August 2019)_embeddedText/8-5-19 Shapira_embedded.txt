Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Glossary page 2 - I strongly disagree with the curriculum including a pro-BDS chapter. This is offensive to the large Jewish community in California and has no place in public education. The BDS movement is politically divisive, and the description of how it will be presented is biased and clearly anti-Israel. It accuses Israel of apartheid, which is an offensive propaganda trope used against the only democratic state that doesn't violate human rights in the middle east. Furthermore, this curriculum, whose stated purpose is to educate about ethnic minorities, does not present Jews as a historically oppressed minority � but only includes anti-Israel tropes with no regard to the Jewish community's history. The description of BDS in the proposed curriculum is one-sided and does not present both sides of the argument regarding BDS and Israel (hence making it anti-Israel propaganda). If this curriculum is passed, it will promote more division and antisemitism, during a time when antisemitism is on the rise. I will have to reconsider sending my children to public school in California if this is the direction in which our school system is going.
