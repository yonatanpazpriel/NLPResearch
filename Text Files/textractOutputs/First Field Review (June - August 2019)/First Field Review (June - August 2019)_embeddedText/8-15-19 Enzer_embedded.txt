This is an opportunity to add in the much needed education of the general public about the path of the Jewish people and culture in this country. Just a few months ago I was discussing with my daughter how sad she was that her 8th grade public school classmates are so unaware of how major an impact the Holocaust had on the Jewish community and how her classmates laughingly make jokes about Hitler without realizing the pain it caused. Many think he wasn't so bad and make remarks in a way that never would have happened (out of ignorance at least) in the Middle school educational experience I had in Ohio 40 years ago. Despite Jews still being a minority there and then, we had a full Holocaust unit in my 7th grade public school, complete with films showing the horrors of the concentration camps and all. Everyone learned about the discrimination and extermination the Jews faced, just as my kids now learn about the plight of African Americans, civil rights and Martin Luther King every year starting in Kindergarten. I love that the Board of Education is trying to bring more education around all minority groups, but I think the Jewish perspective is sorely lacking. Jews are still a minority and our children face the feelings of not fitting in, struggling to observe religious holidays when school and activities don't always accommodate, and facing discriminating and insensitive classmates. Education is the cure.
