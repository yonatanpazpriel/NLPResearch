To Whom It May Concern,
I have read samples of the proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which include describing capitalism as a "form of power and oppression" and critical thinking as "requires individuals to evaluate phenomenon [sic] through the lens of systems, the rules within those systems, who wields power within systems and the impact of that power on the relationships between people existing within systems." instead of weighing evidence and facts while using logic and reasoning.
I want to be very direct and let you know that if this politically motivated curriculum is taught to my children in public schools, I will be pulling my children from any public school to find alternative schooling.
Just as the sexual education curriculum was being discussed, parents are not being contacted to request their feedback nor informed of proposals being discussed. We are not told about what could potentially be taught to our children and are kept in the dark, guessing, wondering if and what will be adopted. I only found out about this from a local radio show, not from our local school district.
It is time parents are kept informed proactively when it comes to our public schools and we will exercise our rights to provide both feedback and take potential future measures to make sure our children are educated without political agendas.
Thank you for your time,
