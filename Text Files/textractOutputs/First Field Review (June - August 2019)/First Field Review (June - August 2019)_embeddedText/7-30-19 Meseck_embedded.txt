From: Scott Meseck Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 4:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your curriculum
The curriculum of the California Department of Education is yet one more reason to move out of California. This isn't education. It is indoctrination. Here is a clue. Don't have only teachers on your curriculum committee. Actually have members of the public on the committee. The reason? Because you people are in a liberal echo chamber and are not serving the public. You may be serving the politically correct morons at the university. But you aren't serving the public.
If anyone is on the committee who represents a department with "studies" after it, kick them off. How about getting back to basics? English, math, science, and history. Not some anti-American leftist version of history, like that proposed by Howard Zinn. How about giving balance to the curriculum?
As I said, getting letters from people like me, is pointless, because you will just enact the propaganda version of your curriculum. This is why students in this state are stupid. It starts with curriculum and the teachers need to know how to teach. Lest you think I am some ignorant conservative, I have a law degree and taught at the high school and college level. What passes for education in this state is pathetic. I would never ever bring up a child in this state, if for no other reason than to avoid the propaganda camps, disguised as schools in this state.
