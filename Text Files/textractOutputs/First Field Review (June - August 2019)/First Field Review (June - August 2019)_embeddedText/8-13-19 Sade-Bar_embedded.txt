My main concern is that the Jewish and Israel minority is address in a negative connotation throughout the curriculum, and would result in even greater antisemitism. I would like this curriculum to be adjusted according to the comments below, and not be used or appear as a source to any teacher, student, or organization, until is shared again, and accepted also by the many ethnic groups and minorities who are discussed here.

A simple search in the document illustrates a significant bias towards the Arab group, while in most chapters where the Arab terms appears, it's showing the Jewish/Israel people in a negative light. Arab � 206 times in the curriculum! Palestine � 21 times Israel � 7 times Jew � 4 times Anti-Semitism � 1 time!

The stereotype term is found numerous times throughout the curriculum, but usually in relation to the Arab people (I saw some Asian phrases as well). I think this draft puts a great emphasis of the Arab population, while almost ignoring a large group who is suffering from violence acts and antisemitism �the Jewish people, as a result of the Arab hatred, but also from other anti-Jewish groups and individuals. It seems like the Jewish topic was ignored altogether although even recently there were several mass shooting incidents targeting the Jewish community in the US. Overall in this draft, Israel gets negative connotations, instead of good ones. There are also many streotypes against Jews, but none are mentioned here.

I suggest to add topics such as the main event which led to the establishment of Israel (the Holocaust, being the only democratic state in the Arab part of the world, the endless terrorism against Israelis and Jewish people around the world, and more.

This curriculum must be improved by adding other aspects of the Arab-Jewish relationship, showing both sides, not merely the Arab side, as it is currently in the curriculum.

The country of Israel is portrayed is a negative connotation. Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel
Page 234 (line 4957) Not clear what this topic suggests � is BDS a good or bad organization? will the students want to join this group which is acting AGAINST Israel???
