Page 1 omits definition of antisemitism. Page 2 includes definition for BOS of Israel & is biased against Israel. Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel. (lines 5157-61.) Pages 268-269 lines 5802-03 uses anti-Semitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land. The model curriculum should add lessons about the history of American Jews as an ethnic group positively. Overall, the new ethnic studies curriculum under proposal appears to display blatant bias against Israel in adopting the view that Israel & its Jewish supporters are "part of a system of oppression and privilege that must be fought with direct action and resistance." The curriculum erases the American Jewish experience, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism amongst all of the countries of the world. As grandparents of children living in Los Angeles County, we view this change as exceptionally detrimental & radically prejudicial against Jews. We would all truly consider moving out of state if this was enacted.
