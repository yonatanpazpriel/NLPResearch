Page 1, line 8. Hxstorically? Really?An X instead of an I, as if the `his' of history is somehow related to the English word `his'? The word `history' comes from Latin historia, which comes from Greek istoria. It has NOTHING to do with the English word `his.' Educators put this together? The use of such spelling hijinks is going to create a generation of students who will think that the word `history' is actually spelled that way because it originally reflected only the history of men! The people who put this together need to rethink their whole approach. You don't improve "hxstory" by manipulating reality and promoting ignorance (even of the linguistic origin of a word) to serve your own agenda!
