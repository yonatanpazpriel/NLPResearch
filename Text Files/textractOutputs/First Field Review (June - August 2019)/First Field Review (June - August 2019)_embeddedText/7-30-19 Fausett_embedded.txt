Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[The Curriculum is very one sided and if used shows no good things done by the citizens of the U.S. A. To the extent children rely on this they are quite liable to feel they have no hope of succeeding. It makes no reference to the historical fight to improve the lot of minorities and the poor Definition of Power is racially charged and not consistent with normal definitions of the word Can't you get a quote from someone other than a first term congressperson. How about Martin Luther King or anyone better known than a person of this caliber.
