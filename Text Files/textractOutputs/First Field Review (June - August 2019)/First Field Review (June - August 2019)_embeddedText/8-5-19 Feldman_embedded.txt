Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The definition of "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)" as "a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" is untrue and deeply offensive. The true aim of the BDS movement is the elimination of the state of Israel and the Jewish presence there. The claim that conditions in Israel bear any resemblance to conditions in South Africa under the aparteid regime is also totally false. If it were true, how could Palestinians and other Arabs be members of Israel's parliament, the Knesset? How could they hold positions of influence in academia, journalism, business, and other fields? In fact, the use of the term "aparteid" is a canard. Shame on those who have introduced this material into our educational curriculum! The following sentence is heavily skewed: "This course will focus on the history of Arab Americans, ... highlighting their contributions and how they have-- similar to other communities of color--struggled against racism, discrimination, harmful stereotypes, and social, political, and economic marginalization." What about the discrimination experienced by the Irish (and other Catholics), Jews, and other non-Protestants? Is that history unimportant because they weren't "people of color"? It seems as though the objective of this course is not to paint a fair and balanced picture of the history of minorities in America, but rather to stir up hatred. How do any of us benefit from this?
