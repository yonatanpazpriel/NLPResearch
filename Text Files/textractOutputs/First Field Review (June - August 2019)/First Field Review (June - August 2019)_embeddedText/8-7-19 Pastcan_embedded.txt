p. 256 Please include more positive perspective of Israel. They have taken in Ethiopians and other groups fleeing percecution and integrated them into their
country.
There are no bombs or suicide terrorists at our southern border with Mexico, so to give that as an example of why a wall is needed with Gaza and the West Bank seems not to make sense. It might be equitable to include Jews as an ethnic group in the United States since mention of several other ethnic groups are in this curriculum.
