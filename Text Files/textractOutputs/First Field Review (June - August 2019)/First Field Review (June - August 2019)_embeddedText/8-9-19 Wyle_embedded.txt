From: Henry Wyle Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:55 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, Aug. 9, 2019
The inclusion of BDS is outrageous. Its goal is to destroy Israel. It is based on a one-sided, anti-Semitic view held by the Arab side of the dispute. It ignores the most basic present facts and history of the struggle there.
