From: ARTHUR COHEN Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
It has come to my attention that the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is very unbalanced with respect to the American Jewish experience, its treatment of antisemitism and its treatment of Israel. I urge you to get further input in these matters and that you rewrite the Curriculum to be fair and inclusive.
Thank you, Arthur and Laura Cohen Palo Alto, CA
