I am deeply disturbed by this model curriculum. It was written with such a clear bias the entire curriculum has been undercut. The curriculum pretends like the Palestinians living in California and a few other groups are the only ethnic groups that students should have on their radar. When fact of the matter is that the current hate crime statistics show that Jews are by and far the largest victims of hate crimes in this state and it has only been growing. My concern is by teaching a curriculum that includes topics that are controversial at best and anti-Semitic at worst this curriculum will only exacerbate incidents of hate.

I would personally recommend completely scrapping this curriculum and develop it, not with political goals in mind, but actually with a mindset of the individual citizens affected by hate in our state. Line 684 - Please strike this line as the BDS movement is the only foreign movement listed and including it here creates a false equivalency. Because the BDS movement is steeped in racism and support of terrorist organizations and destabilizing anti-peace actions, it is intellectually dishonest to include it here. If you need to include social movements from abroad there is no shortage of less controversial ones that actually were trying to achieve change and for far more people than BDS.

Line 4956 - Please strike the reference to Palestine. This topic is a move by antiIsrael activists to create a false equivalency between Black Lives Matter and being anti-Israel. It would require a stand alone course to fully teach the topic and the end result would be that Black Lives Matter has nothing to do with Israeli history. Line 4957 - Please strike calls to boycott Israel. As explained in the other comments it is a political goal that this curriculum is pushing which is counter to it's stated goals. Encouraging students to see parallels where there are none will lead to the mis-education of students. Line 4958 - Please strike reference to Palestine. This is yet again creating a false equivalency. There are few if any comparisons between these two borders and the challenges the two countries face. I am sure that looking at the globe you could find a more intellectually honest comparison. Lines 4959-4970 - This list includes many individuals whose hate is well known. Linda Sarsour recently has been in the news because she kept Jews out of the Women's March, associates with anti-Semites and has been using the organization for self gain. Helen Thomas lost her job because of anti-semitic and anti-Israel comments. Also it is incredible that there are no Jews and Israelis on this list. Line 5154 - This section completely erases the dispossession and expulsion of hundreds of thousands of Jews from Arab lands. On line 5159 there is a description of the term "Nakba" if you insist on including that definition which is deceptive and will be flagged below. Then you must also include a full description of the discriminatory laws enacted against non-muslims across the arab world and the many hate crimes against those populations.

Line 5159 - The sentence should be reflected to say that the largest group aside from the wave of Jewish immigrants were Palestinians who fled during Israel's war of independence when the Arab states attacked the newly declared state, the declaration of which was recognized by the United States and other major powers. During that war Palestinians fled for any number of reasons, they were told to by their leaders who had been conspiring with Nazi Germany, they were avoiding war and according to some they were dispossessed. It should also reflect that the Palestinians are treated as second class citizens across the Arab world. Line 5561 - Please strike the inclusion of Palestinian in the Arab stereotypes as all of the references to the Israeli/Palestinian conflict should be removed. Further, Gaza is governed by Hamas whose mission statement includes the destruction of the state of Israel, so the definition isn't very accurate as a stereotype. Line 24 - The term and definition of anti-Semitism should begin on line 24 following Anthropocentrism. Other forms of hate are included in the glossary including homophobia and islamophobia. It is an unfortunate omission considering anti-Semitic hate crimes outpace other ethnic hate crimes in this state. Line 28 - If BDS is included as a term then Anti-Zionism must be included. The definition should reflect that it is the belief that the Jewish people are the only people that they believe do not have a right to self determination under the law. Anti-Zionists of course have no problem with the Vatican or Saudi Arabia or any other nation-state. Only the nation-state of the Jewish people, it is a clear double standard that needs to be flagged if you insist on tying the Israeli-Palestinian conflict into this curriculum.

Line 30 - The definition of BDS can be removed from this glossary as it has no bearing on ethnic studies for students in California. If you feel it should remain the definition should be updated to make the following edits. The BDS movement seeks to destabilize the region and undercut the Israeli and Palestinian governments so that Hamas and other hate organizations can claim more power. Unlike South Africa Israel is legally occupying the Palestinian people who started wars of aggression against the Jewish state and the Jewish people and who have regularly refused peace talks and the end of the occupation. Next, the BDS movement is by definition anti-semitic because it singles out Israel, the only Jewish state and completely ignores the rest of the world who are legitimate bad actors unlike the State of Israel that seeks to comply with international law and maintain peace and rights for the Palestinian people. Finally, the BDS movement seeks to silence the voices of Israeli civilians who have no part in the continuation of the occupation by keeping them out of academic circles. In that sense the BDS movement is anti-free speech and believes that Jews should be singled out for mistreatment because the actions of the Israeli government. They however have no problem with the inclusion of literally any other national regardless of their government's policies. Line 212 - The definition of Indian skips over the use of the term for individuals originating from the Indian subcontinent. A simple oversight I'm sure since it is only the second most populous country in the world.
