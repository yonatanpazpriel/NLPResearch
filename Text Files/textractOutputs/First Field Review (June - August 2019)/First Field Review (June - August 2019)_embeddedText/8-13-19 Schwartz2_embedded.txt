From: Gail Schwartz Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Stop promoting Anti-Semitism/Anti-Zionism in California schools!
I am appalled @ the efforts to introduce/& imposed an Anti-Israel/Anti-Semitism curriculum in CA High Schools. This is pure propaganda directed against the Jewish people and the totally legitimate State of Israel, the USA's most dependable Middle Eastern ally & the only truly democratic state in the Middle east. Do NOT be slaves to the lies of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Palestinians & the despicable BDS movement!
