The ESMC Denigrates Jews. The ESMC Singles Out Israel for Condemnation "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were to instead marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community. Without significant edits, the ESMC will do just that." The ESMC Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience The ESMC Omits Anti-Semitism. It does not include the term AntiSemitism Three of the 18 members on the advisory committee which developed the ESMC have documented records of anti-Israel bias and support for anti-Israel boycotts.
