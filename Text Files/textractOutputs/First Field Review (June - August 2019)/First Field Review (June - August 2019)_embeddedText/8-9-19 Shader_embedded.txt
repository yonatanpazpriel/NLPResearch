From: meryl shader Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Expressing my opposition to the curriculum
To whom it may concern, As it now stands, the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum is unacceptable because it leaves out antiSemitism, a grave and frightening problem in California, the U.S. and the world. In addition, it presents a biased view of the Middle East that does not reflect the complexity of the actual history while furthering a specific agenda. I am very concerned that a well-meaning plan for new course material has been hijacked and will exacerbate prejudice at a time when our country needs healing and understanding more than ever. Sincerely, Meryl Shader
