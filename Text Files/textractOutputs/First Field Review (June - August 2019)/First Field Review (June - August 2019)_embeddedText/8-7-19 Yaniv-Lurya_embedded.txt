Hi,
I read over the suggested changes to the California schools curriculum and as a mom to 3 American-Jewish girls, these proposed changes worry me.
While I promote studying and learning new and different ways of life, there are hundreds more options to focus and deep dive into other than BDS, and yes, I am worried.
My girls were born and raised here. They should be able to walk happily and freely without having to worry about their identity and where their family came from. It's the land of the free! The land of opportunity! There is no reason in the world to take that away from them!
We all have seen the study Stanford university did about guards and prisoners. There is no reason to introduce more of that to our school systems.
I am completely against adding such a controversial program to any school's curriculum.
Thank you, Sharon
