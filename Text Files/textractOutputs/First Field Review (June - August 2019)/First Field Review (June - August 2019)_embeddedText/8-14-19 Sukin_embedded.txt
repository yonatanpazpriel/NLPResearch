I'm sure the California department of education is already receiving many emails like this. However, having grown up in Sacramento left me wondering if the California department of education even cares about educating students about Jewish American history because I don't remember ever having a history lesson on this topic. Furthermore it is very troubling to hear that your department does not consider one of California's biggest minority groups to be worth of being in your curriculum.
