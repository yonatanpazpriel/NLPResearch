1. Sample Course Models, Asian American Studies Course Outline, Page 140

Philip Jaisohn (a.k.a. SEO, Jae-Pil) arrived in the U.S. in 1885 as a political exile, and became the first Korean to be naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He also became the first Korean American medical doctor as well as an influential political reformer in Korea when he returned home in 1896. He established Korea's first modern newspaper, Tongnip Sinmun (The Independent Newspaper), and also a political organization called Tongnip Hyeop-hoe (The Independent Club). In 1947, he returned to Korea and became a chief advisor to the commanding general of the U.S. Army in South Korea. He died in the U.S. in 1951. - Jim Yong Kim, President of World Bank

1. Page 7, Line 244 Asian Immigration should include Korean 2. Page 7, Line 246 should include Korean agricultural labor along Filipinos
and Japanese 3. Page 14, Line 506 should include Korea Town in Los Angeles and 1992
LA Riot 4. Page 21, Line 807 should consider Korean Americans e.g. Willow Tree
Shade: The Susan Ahn Cuddy Story, Still Life with Rice by Helie Lee 5. Page 40, Line 1634 should include Koreans along Filipinos and
Japanese I noticed Korea Town formation, K-pop culture, handful influential Korean Americans are included in Chapter 2 but I think comprehensive and in-depth Korean American history is lacking in the appendices. Particular attention to Korean American Day (January 13th) is worthwhile to be mentioned as well.
