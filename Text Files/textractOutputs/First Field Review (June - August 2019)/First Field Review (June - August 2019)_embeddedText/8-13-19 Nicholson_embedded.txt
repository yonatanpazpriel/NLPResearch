Ethnic Studies: I am writing in support of the ethnic studies requirement and curriculum in California schools. I have followed and supported the ethnic studies movement in Santa Barbara high schools. This movement is critical to engaging students in their own educational success and their future involvement in civic activities. Please move forward on this important program. Sincerely,
Charles H. Nicholson MD Santa Barbara, CA
