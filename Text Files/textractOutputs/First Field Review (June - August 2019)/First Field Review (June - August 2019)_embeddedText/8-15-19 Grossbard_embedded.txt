dear committee members and decision-makers
i think it is a nice idea to get students to become more aware of various ethnicities. However, it is important that in teaching students about arab minorities you don't teach them about the politics of the Middle East without recognizing that there also is one Jewish state there, and that policies like BDS are very detrimental to Israel. Furthermore, your current proposed curriculum includes a rap song that as a Jew I find very difficult to listen to.
Thanks for taking my point of view into consideration
