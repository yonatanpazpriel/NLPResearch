Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am not pleased with the new proposal for the curriculum. Please remove any reference to the BDS as it promotes hate and division. Any anti-Israel bias should be removed as well. Add lessons about American Jews and their contributions to U.S. society as well as those that fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
