From: Danny Shader Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
My name is Danny Shader. I am deeply concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I think teaching an ethnic studies class is a great idea, but I think very important that you make major revisions or do a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have encountered anti-Semitism throughout my life, but nothing compared to what students at the UCs and other colleges are experiencing today. If we normalize this behavior during kids' formative years, I fear we'll raise an entire generation of anti-Semites who think their biases are completely normal.
Although there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims, the ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism . The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism. That's not just unjust, it's dangerous.
I urge you to address these concerns by fixing or re-writing the curriculum.
Thank you, Danny Shader
