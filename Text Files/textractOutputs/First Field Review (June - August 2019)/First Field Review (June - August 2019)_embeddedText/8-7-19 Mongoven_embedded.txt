This curriculum is impossible to understand without developing/forcing an entirely new vocabulary on citizens. It is shamelessly politically correct and a needless waste of our youngsters' time. Compared to other states, California wallows at AVERAGE or BELOW AVERAGE in math, English, and science. Why waste valuable minutes of a child's day with your blatant attempt at indoctrination? Seriously folks, capitalism is to be viewed upon as exploitative to people of color? Let's throw another log on the racial fires already consuming our country! Shoving this down our children's throats takes precious time away from IMPORTANT subjects (like STEM). California parents and citizens deserve better from our schools. Pass this garbage � allow it to become a part of the K12 curriculum � and parents will vote with their feet. They'll pull their students out of our public schools and move them into private, parochial or home schools. Go back to the drawing board!
