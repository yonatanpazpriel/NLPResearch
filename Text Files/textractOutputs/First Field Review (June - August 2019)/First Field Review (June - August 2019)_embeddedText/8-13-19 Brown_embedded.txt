I'm not sure if this is true but I heard that California was going to define BDS in text books as "A global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions."
I understand that you mean well but promoting an organization that singles out the only democratic country in a region of autocratic ones isn't really fare. BDS and their allies put a spotlight on Israel and to my knowledge, say little about the dozens of other occupations around the world. If this is the case, then how is it not Anti-Semitic? If they're not going to boycott Western Sahara, Tibet, Northern Cyprus, Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, and only Israel what would you call that? Israel left Gaza and now is dealing with terrorism there so if they left the West Bank why should they expect anything different? We should teach our kids fairness.
