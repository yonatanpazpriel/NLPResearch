From: Alon Amit Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:09 AM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Mr. McDonald,
Like many others, I was surprised and dismayed to read the proposed curriculum of ethnic studies in California.
The document is so narrow and biased that it's hard to assume it was written with benevolent intentions. The Arab-American community is portrayed as having a singular core and focus: it is defined by politics, and more specifically the politics of Israel. According to the document, Arab-Americans have no culture, no cuisine, no customs, no contribution to arts or science or anything else. They are defined by being antagonized by anti-Arab sentiment, and by antagonizing Israel.
Meanwhile, the large and influential Jewish-American community isn't deemed worthy of mention at all. In 300 pages of content, the words "Jewish" or "Jew" are mentioned three times, only in passing. The Jewish people have impacted and are impacting American life in profound ways ï¿½ in arts, industry, culture, economy and more. None of that is recognized by the curriculum.
I don't wish to explain to my children why so many worthy communities are given a respectful and wonderful reaching opportunities, whole their own is erased and their parents' county of origin is the only one singled out as requiring political action. This is biased, misleading and hurtful. I respectfully ask that the board review the content and reconsider if it's reflective of the values of inclusion and support it wishes to promote.
Sincerely,
Alon Amit
