I am writing about the thoughtfully put together Model Ethnic Studies curriculum. IT is so imperative for us to learn about ourselves and other cultures as we are coming of age. My own life was enriched and challenged intellectually when I took Ethnic studies classes at university. As a Jewish woman whose family immigrated from Russia, in high school I learned about the legacy of European antisemitism and the Holocaust. However so many young people today, do not see their stories in the curriculum. This is particularly true regarding Arab Americans. Arab-American history is not covered in our schools, even in many schools with Ethnic Studies programs. Arab American youth do not see stories of themselves and remain invisible to many of us. In this era when Islamophobia is on the rise, this impoverishes all of us.
I support the Model Ethnic Studies curriculum. Sadly i have heard that several Jewish organisations claiming to represent all Jews find the curriculum antisemitic and antiIsrael. The inclusion of why many Palestinian Americans fled their homeland is not antisemitic. Just as our children should learn about programes in Russia that led to Jews fleeing to America, we all should learn about the history of why so many Palestinians fled to the United States. This history enriches us all. To censor it, is to impoverish and rob our children.
I support the proposed model Ethnic Studies curriculum for California, including the modules on Arab American history and culture.
Thanks so much,
