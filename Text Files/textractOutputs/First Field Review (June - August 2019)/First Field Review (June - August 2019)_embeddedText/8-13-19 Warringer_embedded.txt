To whom this may concern,
Good evening my name is Adam Warringer. I would like to comment on this proposed curriculum as I have 2 children attending school here in California.
To be completely honest I am totally appalled and absolutely sickened at this horrendous proposal of so called "education". This proposal is anything but an education. It is indoctrination and a complete slant against the very foundation of a properly operating human existence.
These hyper inflated ideas that effect less than 2% of the population are rooted in lies and gross fabrications.
This doctrine that is being proposed is anti God, anti American, anti individuality, anti biology, anti psychology, anti history, anti freedom, anti anything that forms a coherent honest factual thought. I feel this doctrine that is being proposed is an attempt to brain wash our children into some demented Orwellian socialist collectivism.
Capitalism continues to save more life's than any other system ever. Coincidentally the power of capitalism even gives way for the socialistic programs in existence to survive and even thrive.
Tho Marxist socialism has killed 100's of millions of people. Those atrocities were able to be performed by educational and media manipulation. From my understanding those tactics looked very similar to this very curriculum that's being presented. Just added confusion and deception to the already very complex system in place currently.
I am completely against this proposed anti Truth indoctrination.
The further a society drifts from truth, the more it will hate those that speak it... -G.O
