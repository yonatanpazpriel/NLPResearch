Introduction Lines 27-31: The terms "white supremacy, xenophobia, race and racism" appear to be relevant to ethnic studies while, "sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia" have nothing whatsoever to do with ethnicity, race or national origin. These terms are part of a scheme to indoctrinate the young to a particular view that is not based in science. For example, I no longer practice homosexuality as I believe it to be morally wrong. This document appears to use the term "homophobic" to mean hatred toward homosexuals. You would teach that to disagree with another view is unacceptable & hateful. No basis in fact. "Islamophobia" must be seen as a failure to embrace Islam, the Koran and Mohammed as the prophet of the only God, as must an opposition to sharia law. No basis in fact. "Transphobia" is to believe that a person's gender is as assigned at birth by chromosomes and genitalia. No basis in fact. This is nothing more that pandering to a minority of men and women who want their perverse behavior accepted and forced upon our youth. This is something I find offensive and evil.

This business of creating words that don't exist does nothing to aid children in the learning of the English language. Instead it creates confusion. Use REAL WORDS. Requiring the use of a glossary of terms is bad enough for an adult reading technical material, but making up terminology is just plain foolish. Children need words that appear in ANY dictionary found in ANY library. Words that don't change their meaning every election cycle. Capitalism is a term that should be taught in a course on economics or even political science, not ethnic studies. If race is truly the basis of evil in a capitalistic culture, will you teach how many countries have oppressed different people groups, such as the Japanese oppressing Korean, Chinese, Pacific Islanders & other Asian, European and American peoples during their war of aggression in the 1940's? Please don't fail to mention the brutal treatment the British faced when forced to build a railroad in Thailand, or the American slave laborers mining coal in Japan. Remember to point out the Islamic Arabs who profited by enslaving African negroes and selling them to other nations. Don't forget to point out that it was Portugal that lead the WORLD in slave importation for their colony in Brazil. Will the mistreatment of Japanese-American agricultural workers in Hawaii by Phillippine-American foremen be used as an example of capitalism gone bad? Cisgender & Cisheteropatriarchy- please note that Cisheteropatriarchy is showing a red squiggly line underneath (indicating that Microsoft Word does not recognize it as an actual word) It is used in the context of defining the "system of power" as dominating (evil) those who are neither heterosexual or male. The whole business is defining the vast majority of people in the world as "wrong" and "evil" because they are neither homosexual nor some other kind of deviant. Cisheterosexual is yet another word not recognized by Microsoft Word. Please use real words that can be found in ANY dictionary in ANY library.

Environmental Racism: How can you be expected to be taken seriously by any adult that minority communities are being forced to live near toxic waste & pollution? Oh, I forgot. Your audience isn't intelligent adults with some real-life experience. It's impressionable youth who will mostly soak it up like a sponge, becoming conformed in their world view to yours.
