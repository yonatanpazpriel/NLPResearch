Dear members of the Instructional Quality Commission of California Board of Education,
I am writing to urge you to make important revisions to the ESMC incorporating the recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and other organizations which seek a fair and accurate portrayal of Jewish people in America. I am the daughter of Holocaust survivors, a proud US citizen and a grandmother of four, born and being raised in California. I am alarmed by the resurgence of anti-Semitism, and I worry about the future of my grandchildren, and indeed, about the future of our democracy, if we don't teach our children from an early age that we are all created equal and share the same inalienable rights as everyone else in our great country. I am a graduate of the UC system, as are my two adult daughters. It pains me to read about the blatant anti-Semitism at our alma-maters. There is a climate of fear and persecution in the very places where we should strive for enlightenment and cooperation in pursuit of the 'common good.' PLEASE ensure that the ESMC is truly a balanced Model that will go a long way to promote thoughtful dialogue, understanding and respect--among the multiple ethnicities that make up our nation. Respectfully yours, Eva Monastersky
