From: Andrew Kritzer Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Rewrite ESMC - Remove Antisemitism
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I have reviewed the ESMC online and am deeply disturbed by it. I find it bigoted and anti-Semitic, and composed in a way to demonize the Jewish people. Exposing students to these ideas would be against our American ideals and serves no place in our education system.
The ESMC includes BDS as a named organization. Our Congress has found BDS to be anti-Semitic, a fact that seems lost on the authors of ESMC. BDS has been declared racist and has one goal in mind, to end the Jewish existence in Israel.
ESMC does not mention anti-Semitism as a hate crime or discrimination. Any clear-eyed person reading recent news sees that anti-Semitism continues to be a problem (e.g. recent shootings at Synagogues in the US or Nazi symbolization spray painted on Jewish homes).
ESMC also neglects to include that Israel is the historical and ancestral homeland of the Jewish people. This is very much like the Native Americans have America as their native homeland. Instead, ESMC does a "comparison" between "Palestine and Mexico" -- a completely false comparison because there is nothing to compare between the two.
This seeks to polarize students, especially Hispanic students in California, to hate Jews and Israel and believe that the Palestinians are somehow more like them than Israelis are. The truth is the opposite -many Israelis are like first generation Hispanics in California, with parents who fled (or who by themselves fled) violence and hatred in their birth homes to seek a better life.
I urge you to rewrite ESMC to avoid tarnishing the future minds of our children.
Thank you,
Andrew Kritzer
