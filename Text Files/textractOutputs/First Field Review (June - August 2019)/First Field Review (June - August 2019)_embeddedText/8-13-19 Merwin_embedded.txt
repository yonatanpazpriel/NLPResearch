From: Regina Merwin Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: No No No on Ethnic studies proposal
We really do not need this kind of guidance.
I understand the benefits of learning to see one's family and one's self as a product of recent history. That type of exercise could really help history come alive for many students.
HOWEVER from what I have gleaned from the proposal, it is as if the authors wished certain students to wallow in 'hereditary' victimhood as a result of their ancestors' struggles.
Whether or not it is an intentional outcome, these particular guidelines will result in students becoming hypersensitive to perceived slights and emotionally fragile. They will become hostile to the descendants of their ancestor's oppressors, or to the perceived beneficiaries of their ethnic groups' past torments.
They will learn to despise the United States, and if I were a cynical person, I would assume that was the intended outcome of these guidelines.
Please consider scrapping this project.
Respectfully,
Regina Merwin
