From: Greg Cohen Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Addressing antisemitism in ESMC module - concerned parents view
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am concerned by the content in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Coming from a minority group that has been persecuted throughout history, and having two children in public school, I am in favor of teaching ethnic studies class. But the curriculum needs to be balanced and would be incomplete without a serious discussion of antisemitism. A curriculum that erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism is offensive and defeats the purpose of the curriculum which is to teach tolerance and promote inclusion. I am sure you are well aware, this is a challenging time for Jews in America with rising antisemitic attacks, especially on college campuses, synagogue shootings, and holocaust denial. It would be negligent to not address this in the ESMC course. I urge you to make major revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Greg Cohen
