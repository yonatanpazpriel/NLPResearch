From: Tamara Hoffman Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tamara Hoffman Subject: Ethnic Studies curriculum
As a retired teacher, who taught ethnic studies when it was an option or requirement (often called "cultural awareness" I am outraged by the bias shown in the proposed curriculum. As an American Jew I am very concerned about the material which seems to be very slanted against Israel and ignores antisemitism as a hate crime. We are too filled with ethnic hatred globally to encourage it in the California state required curriculum!
Thank you and please Revise this required inflammatory model.
