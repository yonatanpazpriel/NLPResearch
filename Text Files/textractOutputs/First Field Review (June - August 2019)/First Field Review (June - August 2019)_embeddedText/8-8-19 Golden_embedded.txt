To Whom It May Concern:
Thank you for your hard work building a new culture curriculum. I think this is important. As a Jewish community leader and rabbi, I do want to see the history and culture experience of my community better reflected and balanced in the curriculum.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's long standing struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC seems to negate some aspects of the Jewish experience. This seems inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. This is particularly troubling in light of rising anti semitism in America and especially on college campuses, and the ESMC seems omits antisemitism. This is also inconsistent with, and in contrast to, the attention devoted to Islamophobia.
I'm concerned that the ESMC may inappropriately promote the BDS movement. Teaching about it is one thing, if in counter point to other views, but I have a very real concern that this curriculum could promote BDS, and in so doing become unbalanced propaganda. please balance BDS education with a full spectrum of viewpoints.
Thank You,
