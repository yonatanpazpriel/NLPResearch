From: Sbdkids Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 12:34 AM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
The definition of BDS in the ESMC could be: a movement which rejects Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state and is an effort to undermine Israel's existence (ADL). It could be: B.D.S. is a movement that seeks to mobilize international economic and political pressure on Israel in solidarity with the Palestinians (NYTimes).
But the version in the curriculum that claims that BDS is a movement to establish FREEDOM for PALESTINIANS living under APARTHEID conditions is a political statement reflecting a point of view and not a factual statement.
But the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, is unacceptable and it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum.
I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Susan Dab
