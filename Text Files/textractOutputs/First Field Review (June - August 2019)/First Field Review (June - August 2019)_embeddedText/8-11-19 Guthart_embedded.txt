From: Dawn Guthart Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 6:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Fairness in Education
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned and upset by the proposed unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
It is outrageous to put forth a curriculum that erases American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to the world and specifically to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Dawn Guthart
