As an educator, I am disappointed in the attempts to distort the purpose of the bill and erase core aspects of Jewish identity and the American Jewish experience. The ESMC incorporates harmful antiJewish stereotypes and is inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American ethnic groups.
I hope you consider this input to create a balanced ethnic studies curriculum that does not provide a foundation in hate. Our county's climate can not handle anymore institutionalized anti-Antisemitism. -Nicole Bootel
