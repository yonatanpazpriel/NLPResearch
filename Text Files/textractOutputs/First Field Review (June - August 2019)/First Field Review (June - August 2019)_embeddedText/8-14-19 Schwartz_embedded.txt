I am deeply concerned that the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. It erases the American Jewish experience and Jews are omitted as an ethnic group in this curriculum. Furthermore, there is no meaningful discussion of Anti-Semitism or the meaningful contribution that Jews have made to California's history, politics and culture. If this curriculum remains unchanged, I believe it will lead to heightened anti-semitism in California and more hate crimes against Jews like the synagogue shooting in San Diego. Please make the necessary changes to accurately represent the Jewish people and not perpetuate hateful stereotypes.
