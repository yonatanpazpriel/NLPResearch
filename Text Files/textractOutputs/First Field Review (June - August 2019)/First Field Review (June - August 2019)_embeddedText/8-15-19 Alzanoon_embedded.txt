From: SacReg4 PalestinianRights Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies ; Kenneth McDonald Subject: Ethnic Studies Modal Curriculum
The Sacramento Regional Coalition for Palestinian Rights is supportive of the concept of an Ethnic Studies Modal Curriculum. We are particularly interested in the curriculum including sufficient context to be accurate and informative concerning Arab Americans, Muslim Americans, and Palestinian Americans, including those who are Muslim, Christian, other denominations or secular.
From the news reports of strong reactions to the May 2019 draft, with its August 15, 2019 deadline for public comment, the need is clear for follow-up drafts and more opportunities for public input.
We would like to be part of any advisory committee that will be working on this curriculum. We also request that you keep us advised of any and all Ethnic Studies Modal Curriculum meetings including discussion sessions, Curriculum Committee meetings, legislative committee hearings, etc.
Thank you.
Adeeb Alzanoon Chair, Sacramento Regional Coalition for Palestinian Rights
