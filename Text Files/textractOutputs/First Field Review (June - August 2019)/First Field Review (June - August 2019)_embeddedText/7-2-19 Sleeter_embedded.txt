I am very enthusiastic about this overview, which offers a good deal of depth and thought. It connects the core of Ethnic Studies content with pedagogy, the purpose of Ethnic Studies, and why Ethnic Studies exists and is needed. Well done! I have a few relatively minor suggestion (below). In addition to Ethnic Studies being the study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity, I also see it as the study of any academic discipline or interdisciplinary concept from perspectives of people of color � including science, math, etc. Can we push the discussion of what Ethnic Studies is, and of models, toward reconceptualizing existing courses through an Ethnic Studies lens? This idea takes us further than adding ES content to existing courses, in that it challenges us to rethink the course/discipline itself, from its core, from perspectives of People of Color Accompliceship? Is that the right word, is it even a word? I've heard the word accomplice mainly in relationship to law-breaking; I'm wondering if there's a better word. Change the word "being" to "is," since the sentence is written as a separate sentence rather than a clause connected to the previous sentence The Methods section seems long. Reading it, I found myself lost as to where I was in the document. Anyway of tightening this up?

I love this set of lessons from Introduction to Ethnic Studies. I can tell it's from San Francisco since I'm familiar with their work. Not only is the content well thought out, but the pedagogy also clearly shows engaging the students and encouraging them to bring their knowledge into the lessons. I also appreciate how academic skills (such as using and analyzing primary sources) are layered into this unit. This set of lessons is wonderful. Where you live, and impacts of redlining, also affects home value and a family's ability to accumulate wealth through owning a home. To discuss reparations, this lesson needs more direct focus on economic impact of racist policies.
Delete the "s" from the word "helps"

Several of the lessons in this Models doument contain helpful resources. Some of these resources are worksheets that could be used in multiple lessons, such as Think Write Pair/Share. Consider placing those generic worksheets at the end of the Model Curriculum document, and identifying any additional lessons where they would be useful (e.g., where the teaching strategy is mentioned, but a worksheet isn't provided.) Overall, these look useful, they link current issues with history well. I think the strongest one is Attica Prison Uprising. The Redlining lesson duplicates a Redlining lesson in the Intro to Ethnic Studies course, although I'd keep them both because they highlight different aspects of redlining. #blacklivesmatter, very important, as I note below is a little sketchy.

Lesson objectives are supposed to indicate what students will be able to do as a result of instruction, rather than what the teacher will do. Rather that stating "Students will be introduced to," better wording is "Students will be able to define..." There are other objectives in this Models document that describe teaching process rather than what students will be able to do as a result of process, but I didn't want to bog myself down identifying all of those. The steps for the #blacklivesmatter lesson are sketchy. The resources at the end are very useful; can they be connected to the steps? My concern is that a teacher who isn't very familiar with the wider context of police brutality against Black men (going back historically) may not know to move beyond analyzing specific murders. In contrast, lesson steps for the Attica Prison Uprising are clear and detailed � it would be a good model for revising and fleshing out this lesson. With reference to "Lastly" students will cover the birth of the 1960s Chicano movement: Much has happened since then, reflected in the list of topics. Please reword to suggest that Chicano/a/x studies doesn't end with the 1960s.
Is this course focused on Chicanos or Latinos? The list of people includes Puerto Ricans, Latin Americans, etc. For teachers who lump everyone together into one group, this model curriculum should help guard against that. The people on the list are important, perhaps the framing of the course needs to be a little different � Latinx with a focus on (but not exclusive attention to) Chicana/os. Overall, I found the lesson plans interesting. I was confused by the first one (see notes below). I found the Blowouts plan easy to follow, clear, much like what I have done teaching. I found the Foods plan quite interesting, students would get a lot from it, I would think.

Students will be able to 3) "Learn about" describes a classroom process, not what students will be able to do as a result of instruction. Perhaps students will be able to "explain how organizing and advocacy counteract institutional racism..." This lesson plan needs work. Most of the plan itself seems to be embedded within the discussion questions that begin on p. 85. I got lost. I was confused about "Refer to your research," mentioned in several questions, but I didn't see where the research happens. Many questions assume teacher familiarity with the play and things that many teachers won't be familiar with. This lesson plan simply isn't clear to me. When the pairs of students construct their own demands, are they supposed to be thinking of the 1960s, or demands they would have now? Please clarify.
Interesting questions, but they presume having some information to use to answer them. At the end of the unit, I see a list of resources. Which of those should the teacher be using here, so students have something to work with in addition to their own experience? Unclear. "Both of us" � is who? No author is listed for this vignette.
This is perhaps the most teacher-friendly unit in the curriculum document. It has substance and significant ideas (such as push/pull factors, the 4 I's, immigration policy); active student learning; and it also provides all the resources teachers would need, showing what to use where. More of the units (especially those that are overly sketchy) should be put together more like this one. There may be excess resources that could be trimmed (such as the debate protocol), but I think it's helpful to err on the side of too complete of a plan, than too sketchy of a plan, especially when the purpose of the Model Curriculum is to guide teachers who don't have a good grasp of Ethnic Studies. This one does that.

This is a very interesting collection of lesson plans. I found all five interesting, thoughtful, substantive, and relevant. Although a couple of them could use some light editing (especially Lesson Two on Myths and Realities), these are really good examples. Rather than "the Asian American and Pacific Islander experience," as if there were only one, wouldn't it be more accurately to say "Asian American and Pacific Islander experiences"?
Change "Discuss the political and strategic differences. . ." to "What were some political and strategic differences. .." so that this item is a question, like the rest of the items in the list.
I believe Lis Valdez should be Luis Valdez.
Delete "Learn to" from Objective #3.
In addition to what is already in this lesson, the authors might consider including an analysis of shifting US immigration and hiring policies. As more wealthy and well-educated Asians have been encouraged to come to the US, (for instance, Indians in high-tech), many in the US see increased economic success of Asians in general as due to hard work here, rather than education and economic and education resources recent Asian immigrants have brought.

The three objectives begin with Students will be able to... But only the first is written to reflect that beginning. Reword #2 and #3 so they similarly reflect that beginning.
You might mention that some Indigenous peoples of Mexican and other Latinx descent identify as Indigenous or Indian more than as Latinx or Mexican. The wording here suggests that Latinx trumps Indigenous identity, and that isn't always the case, at least at the level of identity. Add in land reclamation movements. The Ohlone associated with the Shellmound work have also been quite active in land trust work for land reclamation.
I'm happy to see this lesson here as it addresses an important issue linking past and present. This lesson has a great list of resources; an awful lot seems packed into Day 1. Might Day 1 actually work better if it were 2-3 days?
I'm confused about how the lesson "exposes students to the complexities behind the absence of Native oral and cultural history in traditional history textbooks". The rest of the lesson fits together, although it seems to cover a lot with rather minimal direction to the teacher. But that first sentence doesn't seem to describe the lesson. I love this lesson on land acknowledgment. The one thing that seems to be missing somewhere around line 4554 perhaps is dialog with members of the local tribe. For an actual land acknowledgment, collaboration with local tribal members is important; somehow the lesson should convey that. Objective #7 seems missing from the list of lesson steps. Otherwise, very interesting and worthwhile lesson.

Good idea to include this course. I found the lessons interesting and valuable, although Lesson Three offers less of a distinct contribution that the other lessons (see my note below about Lesson Three). I was especially intrigued by Lesson Two on Hip Hop, its connection of Arab Americans with Latinx and Black Hip Hop artists, and its focus on music as a vehicle for social change I believe the word "proceed" should be "precede"
Needs some editing so that format is clearer. Right now everything is bulleted. There's Day 2 but Day 1 is not marked as such. Some procedures specify how many minutes, most do not. Good substance to course, but editing would help. Latinos as used here � does the idea include Puerto Ricans, Cubans, etc. � or mainly Mexican Americans? My sense is that the lesson plan is encouraging a comparison of experiences of Mexican immigrants and Arab immigrants, but I'm not 100% sure. I encourage the authors to be as specific as possible. Her parents were exiled IN Chile under Pinochet? Or exiled from Chile? I haven't heard of Chilean being exiled in Chile under the dictator, but rather from Chile. Where do students get taught what hegemony means? I looked at the handout, and it seems to assume they know what it means. This lesson is very interesting to me, but depends on students having a good grasp of the concept hegemony. This conversation between Busta and Narcicyst is so interesting, what a powerful way to show shared oppression between members of two different racialized groups. Day 1 of Lesson Three is very repetitive of Lesson One. The main idea of this lesson � Otherization, discrimination � isn't developed in much detail (lines 5963 +). Can this lesson be reworked to elimination duplication with Lesson One, and expand on the teaching of what is currently marked as Days 3-5?

Too much is packed into this one lesson, and the Assessment section reads like another lesson. There are three or four different potential lessons here. I think this all needs development. Without that, it runs the risk of perpetuating lumping all Pacific Islanders together, and with the stereotype that Asians do well in education but Pacific Islanders do not. I believe this course can be valuable, but it needs more development.
