As a child of California K-16 public education and a parent of 3 children who completed K-12 in California schools, this development of ethnic studies curriculum is very important. As an Arab American, this inclusion of Arab American studies is extremely important to me and others in my community. In an era where discrimination facing Arab Americans of all religious beliefs is rising each day, it is very important for California to stand out and make sure that those of us from marginalized communities are represented.

Arab American Studies Course Outline � the objectives listed in Chapter 2, page 233, are important to show the benefits of teaching Arab and Arab American's diverse history. It is important to educate our children to prevent discrimination and create an open welcoming environment. This is a voice that is not brought out in our current curriculum in a meaningful way and the overview is very comprehensive in its discussion of important points.

Chapter 2, page 236 -Information combats prejudice. As an immigration attorney in California I see the impact of today's policies on immigrants as a whole and Arab American immigrants in particular. Sharing the Arab American immigration experience would provide information in a confusing time. Arab American immigration is not new to our country and it would surprise many to understand the history of Arab immigrants in the United States. As the daughter of an Arab American immigrant, I would have loved for my heritage to be celebrated through education, but today, it is critical. Post 9/11 children not only face the general discrimination of membership in a marginalized community, but they also face the lingering hatred of toward Arabs (and Muslims) which is being built up into a frenzy today.

General

As a general comment, for too many years we have talked of two focuses in conversations related to children's education in California � 1) educating the whole child and 2) closing the achievement gap. This is one step to focus on both. The more children feel welcomed and respected in the school environment, the more they are able to learn. Too many students are not exposed to concrete information about marginalized communities and those communities not only suffer but are targets of a larger focus of hate � especially today.
