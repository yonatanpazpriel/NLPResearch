From: Diana Moss Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 9:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Definition of Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions
To whom it may concern,
Please consider revising this definition. It is clearly not an objective nor an impartial definition of the term. This definition could do more harm than good on a highly charged and difficult Middle East situation and create hate against Israel and Jews. There is no room in an Ethnic Studies curriculum for this bias.
Thank you for your consideration.

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.
