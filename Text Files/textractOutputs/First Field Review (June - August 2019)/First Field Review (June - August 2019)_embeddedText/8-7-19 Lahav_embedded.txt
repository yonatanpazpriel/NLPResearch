From: Guy Lahav Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 6:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS in new curriculum
I think it is a travesty that history is being altered in California proposed education. BDS is a group that is fueled by antisemitism and hate and they are allowed to distribute their propaganda with the help of California curriculum. The holocaust, which affected millions and was a major part of the world war is overlooked. As are jews as a minority. This is disappointing and I hope that the education department will not promote antisemitism
