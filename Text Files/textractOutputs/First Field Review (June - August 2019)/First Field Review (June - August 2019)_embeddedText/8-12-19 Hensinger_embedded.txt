I am deeply concerned at the way Jews and Israel are portrayed in the latest ethnic studies draft. It is factually incorrect to compare the situation of Palestinians, who live in the internationally recognized state of the Palestinian Authority, to "apartheid." furthermore BDS is widely acknowledged, including in American allies like Germany, as antisemitic. The role of Jewish Americans in movements against segregation and in support of LGBT rights is not acknowledged.
This latest draft is factually incorrect and morally specious. It should be junked.
