Page 2 of the Glossary � The definition of the BDS movement is highly inaccurate and does not once mention the movement's campaign to end Israel's existence. Page 242 � The mention of Palestinians having to feel the newly created State of Israel does not at all give voice to the fact that the UN partitioned the land to give half of it (the more inhabitable half) to the Arab citizens so that that they could thrive and build a country of the their own. The rejected the offer and hoped that a campaign of war would give them the entirety of the land. Page 268 � "Get out Yankees from Latin America..." � Aren't we supposed to be teaching our children that countries with mixed peoples are the ideal... that we can all learn from each other?

Page 234 � How can BDS be a resource students should be looking at when this curriculum is supposed to ensure that our kids have a love and understanding for all people? This is an opportunity to teach the next generation about an important part of our American story � the gift of Arabs coming from the four corners of the earth to live the American dream. Why does teaching about Arab Americans need to highlight an organization that negates the need for the Jewish people to live in a land of their own? My father came from Yemen (an Arab country) and had to flee his home because of persecution... should the curriculum mention the 1 million Jews who came from Arab lands and found refuge in Israel, America, Europe?
