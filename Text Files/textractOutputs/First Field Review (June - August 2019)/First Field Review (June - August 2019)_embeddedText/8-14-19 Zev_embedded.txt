I think that the stated goal of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, "to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism" is admirable. I therefore find it surprising and deeply disturbing that the posted curriculum completely omits any discussion of antisemitism. I am further disturbed by anti-Semitic language in the Arab-American section of the curriculum. Far from aiding in the eradication of bigotry and hate, this curriculum promotes it, in its language and one-sided portrayal of the Arab-Israeli conflict.

I join with others in urging you to remove anti-Semitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, the history of discrimination against Jews in America, and the current rise of hate crimes against Jews.

Thank you for listening to me.
