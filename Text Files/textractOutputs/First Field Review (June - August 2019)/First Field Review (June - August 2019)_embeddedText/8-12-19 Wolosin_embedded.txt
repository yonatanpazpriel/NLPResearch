Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As a college student at UC Berkeley in the 90's, I had the great fortune of taking multiple Ethnic Studies courses as part of my Sociology major. Those classes, which introduced me to struggles and concepts that have shaped who I am today, were invaluable. And while I am a huge proponent of teaching Ethnic Studies to high school students, I share the concerns and recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus' letter. I am alarmed and disturbed by the anti-Jewish bias that has been woven into the model curriculum and I strongly encourage you to make major revisions or significantly rewrite it.
Please do not allow something intended to be so positive, to alienate so many.
Thank you, Jen Wolosin Jewish mother of an 11 year old and a 9 year old
