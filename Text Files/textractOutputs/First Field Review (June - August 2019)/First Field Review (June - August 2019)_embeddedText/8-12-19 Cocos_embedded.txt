From: Mike Cocos Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
California Department of Education,
I write to you as a concerned citizen. I find the draft of the ESMC regarding the erasing of the American Jewish experience to be inaccurate, misleading, discriminatory and scary.
Among other things ESMC singles out Israel-- the world's only Jewish state-- for special critique and condemnation.
If this ESMC was to be adapted it would contribute to further Anti-Semitism and hatred.
Please reconsider the proposed curriculum as it relates to Jews and Israel, and decline this draft ESMC.
Thank you,
