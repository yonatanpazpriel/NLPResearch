Commenting on the lines 19 till 79. The definition. It leaves out the worst and the one thing that covers all, THE reason why a model for a curriculum for Ethic Studies is put up and that is the worst of human behavior: GENOCIDE.
 Teaching good behavior is grounded in what we (as adults) know is the worst behavior and what possibly may develop into the worst in the wrong context and circumstances. So please write in the umbrella that covers the whole. The very well written examples of the groups are included into the model for a curriculum but left out is the GENOCIDE PARADIGM.

The genocidal paradigm has all the elements, from there the mentioned examples are perfect to connect a world of imagination.
