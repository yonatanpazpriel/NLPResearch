I actually think this curriculum is losing the plot. Ethnic studies reinforces racism and creates generations of victims who never knew they were supposed to be victims. It also creates separation and mistrust of others outside our own micro-ethnic group. A very wise American once said "As long as we continue talking about color and race, racism will continue." - Morgan Freeman. This is a man who grew up under real crushing Jim Crow racism in the 50s in Memphis TN. He understands what it is far better than any of us, perhaps we should listen.
Rather than continue to teach ethnic victimhood, shouldn't we teach our children to look forward and that what really matters in 2020 is the content of their character rather than the color of their skin?- Paraphrased from another great American, Martin Luther King. He also keenly understood real racism and is turning in his grave right now over this ethnic studies curriculum.
I respectfully suggest shelving this deeply politically motivated ethnic studies curriculum until wiser heads can create a more balanced and forward looking perspective putting character and personal responsibility far above race or skin color.
