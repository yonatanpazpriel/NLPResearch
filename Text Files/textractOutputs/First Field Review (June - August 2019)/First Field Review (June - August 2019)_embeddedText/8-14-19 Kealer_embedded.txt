I have been reading for several days about the new curriculum. I think the idea of teaching our young people to think about issues critically is most important in this day and age. However, I don't believe that teaching them about BDS and encouraging them to support it distorts the concept and teaches them to think for themselves. It strikes me as one-sided propaganda.
The Israel ï¿½ Palestinian conflict is made up of too many facets to sum it up in such a way as presented. I thought the purpose of the studies were to "enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." Do you honestly believe that is what you are promoting?
I believe that the Palestinians have valid issues regarding the State of Israel, but so does the State of Israel and the Jews. Jews have been murdered for thousands of years, Roman prosecution, programs In eastern Europe and Russia, and the Holocaust in Germany, just to name of few. Antisemitism and intolerance to Jews around the world is in on the rise and dangerous.
Critical thinking DEMANDS that ALL ethnic groups be presented and studied, including the Jewish people. Only then can our young people learn to THINK FOR THEMSELVES.
