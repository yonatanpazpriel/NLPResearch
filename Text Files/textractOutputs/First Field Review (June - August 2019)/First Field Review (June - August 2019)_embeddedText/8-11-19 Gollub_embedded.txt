From: Marshall Gollub Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:32 PM To: CFIRD; Ethnic Studies Subject: AB 331
I am opposed to AB331, the proposed ethnic studies curriculum for California high schools. I have a granddaughter in high school in California, another granddaughter in California who will start high school next year, and a grandson in California who will start high school a few years later. I don't want my Jewish grandchildren in California high schools -- or anybody's children or grandchildren -- to be bullied, shamed, or harassed, or even physically harmed, by classmates and teachers acting in accordance with the anti-Semitic and very objectionable proposed curriculum. Let's keep our schools places of education, not places of hostile indoctrination.and bullying. Thanks very much. Marshall Gollub, MD
