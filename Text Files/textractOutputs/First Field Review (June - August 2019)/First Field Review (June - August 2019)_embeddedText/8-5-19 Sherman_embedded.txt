From: Richard Sherman Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 3:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS is an antisemitic genocidal movement. Period.
Omar Barghouti, the cofounder of BDS, has said the SOLE purpose of BDS is to euthanize the Zionist dream known as Israel. A student of history, Barghouti knows full well that the Nazi T4 Euthanasiav Program was the foundation of the Final Solution of the Jews as enacted in the Wannsee Protocol in January 1942. His use of the word euthanasia leaves no doubt he co-founded BDS to continue the antisemitic eliminationist mission formalized by Reinhard Heydrich and Adolf Eichmann at the Wannsee Conference. Barghouti's words make clear that BDS is no more a "social movement whose aim is to achieve freedom through equal rights and justice" than were the Nuremberg Laws or the death camps at Auschwitz and Treblinka.
