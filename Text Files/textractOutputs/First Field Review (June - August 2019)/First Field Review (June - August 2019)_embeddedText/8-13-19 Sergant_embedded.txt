From: Shira Sergant Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 9:31 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum = Problematic
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am not at all pleased by the recommended Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I am an Israeli-born Jewish woman and an educator and do not feel the proposed curriculum represents the way that students in California should be introduced to concepts about Israel and Jews.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Shira Sergant Culver City, CA
