Dear CA Board of Education: > > My name is Lori Shearer. I am on the Board of Congregation Beth Israel in San Diego, an active volunteer in my 9 year old son's school, Bird Rock Elementary in La Jolla, CA, and my family is Jewish. > > I am writing to ask that the California model curriculum be revised to include a definition of anti-semitism, the definition of the symbol of a swastika and why it is a deeply offensive symbol and it will also be helpful to understand why Jews are a minority in the world and the United States of America by reviewing the hundreds of years of history of Jews being brutalized and dehumanized in Spain in 1492, in Russia at the turn of the last century, the Holocaust during WWII and recent horrors of the murders at The Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, PA and the Chabad Synagogue in Poway, CA. > > I will share a personal story to illustrate why it is extremely important to educate High School students about why a swastika is an offensive symbol. A few months ago, before the Poway Synagogue shooting, I stepped outside my home in North Pacific Beach and saw a swastika etched into the street in front of my mailbox. A couple feet away, a clumsy rendering of, male genitalia was etched into the street. Law enforcement thought the perpetrators might be young boys. Then, a week later, a neighbor found a swastika etched into the hood of his car. Then, weeks later, swastikas were painted along La Jolla Mesa Drive. Three incidents of this disgusting symbol defacing a few blocks of a residential neighborhood in San Diego is clearly a call to educate California's young people and the general population about why this is a chilling and terrible act. > > Thank you for your time. > > Sincerely,
