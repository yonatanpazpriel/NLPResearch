I am pulling my child out of the public schools. The schools think it's okay to teach kids that capitalism is bad and racist. They teach that white people are bad. They teach that Europeans are bad. They teach that changing your gender is perfectly normal. Your schools are garbage and nobody I know uses them, anyone with two cents to rub together uses private school or home schools you your schools are basically communist propaganda and the teaching of literature and actual history is nonexistent. I am copying my local newspaper and I hope they report on this scandal that is really a criminal act.Jo
