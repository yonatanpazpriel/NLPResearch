To whom this may concern: These comments are intentionally brief as the deadline approaches. I hold a K-12 Teaching Certificate from San Jose State (1972). I have a Master's Degree in Curriculum and Instruction from Portland
State University, 1994. I taught In public middle school in Oregon until 2001. My field of study and teaching emphasis was on what is now referred to here as ethnic studies. We used a curriculum called Respecting Ethnic and Cultural Heritage (R.E.A.C.H.). I continued to work in School District 4j until 2009,overseeing the implementation of Reading Testing and data collection.
I am well aware of the shortcomings and pitfalls of transmitting sensitive content through schooling. Yet it is absolutely necessary to do so in as broad and inclusive, scientific and factual, means as possible. My own research focused on the Latino portion, an increasing population in Oregon in the 1980s and following years.
I applaud the work done on this draft curriculum. As a retired educator, I am in favor of the new curriculum in general. Further inclusions and refinements should be considered. Many stakeholders will have objections and agendas, all worthy of consideration. I would be happy to give more input as the project continues. I consider this the single most important issue in education at the present time. Respectfully,
Gloria H. Merriam
