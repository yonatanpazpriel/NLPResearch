From: Gwyer Schuyler Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Subject: I want to express my support of California AB2016 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,
I hold my doctorate in Education from UCLA and a Master's Degree in Counseling. Based on my background in counseling and education and my work at Santa Barbara City College as an academic counselor, I feel strongly that Ethnic Studies is an important and valuable area of study and helps all students better understand themselves and those around them. I am deeply concerned that the efforts to develop the Ethnic Studies curriculum are being undermined by people who are racist, sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic. I think it is very important that we stand strong against these forces and that we celebrate our state's diverse population. Everyone deserves to study their history and culture -our state curriculum should reflect that inclusivity.
Please do not give in to the critics of the state Ethnic Studies curriculum. While I fully support a close analysis of the content by qualified faculty and content experts, I am adamant that including Ethnic Studies in the curriculum is a very positive step that will benefit all students.
Sincerely,
Gwyer Schuyler, MA, Ph.D. Academic Counselor Santa Barbara City College
