From: Allison Leff Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum updates- Ethnic
Please consider updates to the curriculum that do not stereotype Jews or any other ethnic minority group. No group should be stereotyped. Antisemitism should be taught and never minimized since this is hate.
The world is a crazy place and our children need to understand people are different and we can all live together in a Peaceful world
Best, Allison Leff
