Congratulations on addressing a difficult and important task!
I understand the importance of addressing Islamophobia and what it is like to be part of groups not viewed as white.
The curriculum mostly ignores Jews on the theory that we are just like all the other white people and Arabs are just like all other people who aren't white. So in talking about restrictive agreements, it ignores the fact that most of them in California and elsewhere were against Jews and blacks.
Israel is viewed as an example of colonial empire. It is treated as if some European empire planted it's citizens there to oppress the not white people living there even though it is the only place Jews have always lived.
The fact that BDS is about making Israel the Palestinian state is ignored. Yet that is what the South Africa analogy is all about as Omar Barghouti has explained to a large and enthusiastic audience in Pleasant Hill, CA.
Education is best when it is open ended and students are challenged to think about different points of view. Here it reads like anti-Israel Arab activists, who are sure they have all of the truth, created tools to indoctrinate students in their truths. Is that a wise way to address a difficult and complicated situation?
