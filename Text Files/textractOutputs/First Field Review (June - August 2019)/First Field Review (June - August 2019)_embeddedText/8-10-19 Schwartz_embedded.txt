From: david schwartz Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 7:23 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Urgent Request To Revise or Rewrite ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
Subject: Urgent request to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
We are are alarmed by the current incomplete and misleading version of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. We support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but implore you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
If the purpose of California's new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is to build a shared understanding of ethnic groups' perspectives and engage minority students in school, its current proposed version, is replete with antiSemitic tropes, one-sided BDS bias, and demonization of Israel.
A few examples:
 There is no mention of anti-Semitism.

 Anti-Semitism is excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews

 The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective

 A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included
If the current version of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is not rewritten, an entire generation of students will be taught anti-Semitism. Furthermore, what becomes the curriculum standard in California is likely to be copied by other states.

We urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address the above concerns.
Thank you,
David Schwartz & Carol Schwartz
