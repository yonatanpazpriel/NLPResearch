By law, teachers must "impress upon the minds of the pupils the principles of ... truth [and] avoid ...falsehood." CA Ed Code Section 233.5(a). "All instructional materials ... shall be...accurate, objective..." CA Ed Code Section 60045(a). "...only instructional materials which...accurately portray the cultural and racial diversity of our society..." are to be used. CA Ed Code Section 60040. CDE's "History and Social Science Framework for California Public Schools" requires that instructional materials "present accurate, detailed content" including primary sources which must convey "an accurate and thorough sense of the period" and narratives which present "an accurate and vivid picture of the times."
This part is inaccurate and so needs to be corrected: "...a region of the Ottoman Empire then called Syria (which includes the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine/Israel)" is inaccurate and should be corrected
Israel-Palestine is not a single entity and shouldn't be hyphenated. Israel is the name of a country. Palestine is the name of a separate territory.
Suggested correction: "...a region of the Ottoman Empire then called Syria (which includes the modern states of Syria, Lebanon, and Israel, as well as the Palestinian Territories."

This part is inaccurate and so needs to be corrected: "If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains..."
Israel-Palestine is not a single entity and shouldn't be hyphenated. Israel is a country. Full stop.
Also, there is no country called Israel-Palestine, and it is inaccurate to say "for each country" and refer to a non-existing Israel-Palestine entity as one of the supposed "countries" in the list.
Palestine is a separate geographical area including Gaza and the West Bank. Palestine is predominantly Arab territory. In Israel, a minority of about 20% are Arabs (with full citizenship, voting rights, health care coverage, etc.). Jews living in Palestine are not granted similar rights.
Arab-Americans have come to the US from both Palestine and Israel, although the majority of Arab Americans have come from other parts of the world.
Suggested revision: Correct the various inaccuracies explained above, especially avoiding all use of the term "IsraelPalestine," which is not a country or a state or any sort of exiting entity.

Comment
SBE's "Guidelines for Ethnic Studies Curriculum" and CDE's "History and Social Science Framework for California Public Schools" require that all students be taught a "balanced" curriculum. The Guidelines also call for materials that give a "cultural understanding of how different groups have struggled and worked together."
This part is not balanced and so needs to be revised: The definition of BDS, and the polemicized language within it, are not only unbalanced but inaccurate. The goal of BDS, as defined repeatedly by its leader Omar Barghouti, is the elimination of the Jewish state of Israel. The fraudulent BDS definition of "international law" as requiring Israel to be forced to accept unlimited generations of descendants of Arab refugees from the war which the Arabs launched against the Jews is based on a nonbinding UN General Assembly resolution (UNGA 194, 1948). By the criteria adopted by the US Department of Education, BDS is an antisemitic movement because it opposes the existence of the Jewish state within any borders.The House of Representatives, in an overwhelming bipartisan vote, recognized that "the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel is not about promoting coexistence, civil rights, and political reconciliation but about questioning and undermining the very legitimacy of the country and its people: "
Suggested revision: eliminate this definition entirely, or rewrite it to 1) eliminate the one sided language and 2) include the language of H Res 246 in describing it.
