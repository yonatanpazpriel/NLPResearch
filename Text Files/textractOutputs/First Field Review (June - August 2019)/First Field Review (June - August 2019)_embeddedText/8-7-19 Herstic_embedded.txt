From: grace toher Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 4:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Biased anti Israel curriculum
This proposed curriculum would fit in in Nazi Germany, and I am not using hyperbole. Historical fact is ignored, eg Arabs were never a separate palestinian identity, just part of the Ottoman Empire. Emotions replace fact, eg the recreation of the Jewish national homeland is called a catastrophe using the Arab word Nakba.
This is a shameful, hateful biased racist program. If you implement it you will be worse than racist: you will be responsible for any antisemitic acts in the future.
Shame on your allowing this to even be considered.
