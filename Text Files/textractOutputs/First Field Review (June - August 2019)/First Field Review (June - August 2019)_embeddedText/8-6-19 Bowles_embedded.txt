Two points: 1) Whatever the merits of this program may be, describing it with a jumble of buzzwords and academic gibberish is insulting. Parents and the general public do not live in a world where such "in-crowd" bilge passes for normal expression; they rightly feel excluded and dismissed. If you can't re-write this in normal language, you have no business teaching our children. 2) This document does not say what parts of the existing curriculum will have to be eliminated in order to incorporate the new curriculum into the school year. It should, with an explanation as to why. Are you afraid to say? Philip Bowles
