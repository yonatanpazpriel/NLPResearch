[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here: As a Jewish American, I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. Islamophobia and anti-Arab sentiment is a big problem in today's society, and educating young people about the reasons why Arabs have immigrated to the United States and how they participate in our society is crucial to combatting Islamophobia. There is absolutely no connection between educating about Arab-Americans, including Palestinians, and anti-semitism, despite what pro-Israel organizations may claim.

� I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
