I'm writing to you to express my concern and dismay over the proposed new ethnic studies curriculum. To eliminate any mention of Jewish people as a marginalized minority is unbelievable. In the 20's there were the Protocols of Zion which spread virulent anti semitism in the United States; there were many clubs and businesses that had signs No Jews allowed then you have the Holocaust which is still one of the most horrific crimes against humanity to date. A targeted, methodical, intentional means to rid the world of a people. Up to 1960, La Jolla, Calif. did not allow Jews to live in La Jolla but in order to establish UCSD, this was rescinded because many of the hired Jewish professors needed a local place to live. Jews are prominent in medicine, education and where would we be without the Jews who established the movie industry? Anti semitism is blossoming yet again and yet, this is not considered a problem to recognize?? I think this program needs to reconsider all the minorities who have been marginalized, restricted and victimized.
Thank you, Melinda Wynar
