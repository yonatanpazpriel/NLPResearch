Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I recently read through the draft of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I agree that there is a need for ethnic studies in California high school education, but I believe that the draft in it's current form would not be an inclusive way of teaching the subject. As a Jewish-American resident of California, I was dismayed to note that neither antisemitism nor the contributions of Jews were mentioned in a document that is intended to promote inclusion and take a stand against bias and intolerance. I have also been made aware of the letter written by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, which calls for a major revision of the draft, and I would like to add my voice to those making this request.
I have two school-age children attending California public schools. I would very much like for their education to include messages of inclusion and tolerance, and for their studies to teach them about bias and tactics to avoid it and build bridges. I fear that this curriculum would cause them to see being Jewish as a negative trait, and to bias their peers and teachers against them.
I would urge you to please revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Michael Coyle
