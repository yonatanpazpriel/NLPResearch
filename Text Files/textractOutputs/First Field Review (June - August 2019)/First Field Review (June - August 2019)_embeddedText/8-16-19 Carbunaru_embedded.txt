From: Natalie Carbunaru Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 10:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments regarding the proposed ethnic studies curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Committee
I am concerned with the new Ethnic curriculum proposed by the State, in particular its treatment to antisemitism which is a growing concern not only in California, but also in the US and the rest of the world. This issue is of great importance to my whole family, as we feel increasingly concern and sometimes afraid to approach Jewish institutions or even to openly indicate that we are Jewish. Antisemitic attitudes have unfortunately been perpetuated through history, even to the point that in many cases people have become desensitized to them. However, for those who suffer from those views, this is increasingly concerning as the occurrence of antisemitic related events keep increasing. I welcome the idea of ethnic studies as part of California curricula as a way to provide the education to reduce this terrible historical error. It would be a very sad and terrible situation if this opportunity were lost or even worse, exacerbate this problem. The Jewish community has played a great role in American society and has contributed to important values that constitute major principles of what makes the USA a special nation. This is in addition to the many contributions that Jewish people have made in many fields in science, arts, entertainment, technology, etc, in California.
Sincerely Natalie Carbunaru Valley Village, CA
