From: Howie Fialkov Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The Proposed Anti Semitic Curriculum
Sir/Madam,
I am sending you this email to register my revulsion at the proposed "ethnic" curriculum that the State of California is considering mandating for all public high schools in California It is incredulous to me that the drafters of this proposed curriculum have not realized that it is incredibly biased against Jews and Israel Unfortunately this is all too common among the "progressives" int today's society Can you imagine the uproar if the same type of bias that presently is contained in the draft curriculum treated Muslims or any other minority in the same manner as is proposed to treat Jews? I urge you to not allow this blatant anti Semitic curriculum be instituted that will undoubtedly increase hatred of Jews and Israel, which is maybe what the drafters of this curriculum want SHAME!!!!
