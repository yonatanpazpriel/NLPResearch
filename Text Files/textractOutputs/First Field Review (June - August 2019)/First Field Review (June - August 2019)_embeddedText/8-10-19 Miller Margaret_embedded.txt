From: mickimum Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: disturbing Ethnic Studies curriculum Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am distressed by the disturbing Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but need you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Since, forty years ago, my sons had unpleasant experiences of anti-semitism in California public schools - which were dealt with properly by the by the school principal - the issues here concern me greatly
The current political situation makes this even more important. We cannot have our children exposed to anything that includes of the type of innuendos that exist in this current document.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Thank you,
