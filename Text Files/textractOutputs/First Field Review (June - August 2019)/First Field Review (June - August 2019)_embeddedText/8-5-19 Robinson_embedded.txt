I am a retired college librarian and I am grateful for this opportunity to comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. California � and other states � have needed such a teaching tool for many years, but there is no better time than now to implement it. I believe the people who will oppose this curriculum will do so out of ignorance of the very information this curriculum will provide.

Much of the history of ethnic and minority groups in the U.S. has been left out or removed from elementary and high school instruction. This omission causes people to accept common stereotypes and political explanations for societal differences, which in turn widens the gulf between groups and increases the likelihood of injustice toward ethnic and minority groups.

All students should learn the history of slavery and racism, Native American removal, Japanese internment camps, and all the rest. I believe that by understanding how beliefs about ethnic and minority people were developed in order to support national economic and political policies, citizens will be able to better accept, perhaps embrace, the reality of a multiethnic society.
