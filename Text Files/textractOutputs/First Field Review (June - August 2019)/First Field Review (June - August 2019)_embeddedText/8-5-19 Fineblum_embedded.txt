If you as an educational agency teach these values, then you are complicit in spreading hate. The Jewish people have created a haven, an enterprising society and a light to the world in a sea of anger and resentment. The nations surrounding Israel make little contribution to the world. Encourage Jewish humane values. Advance the culture of success. Do not promote poverty and dependency as you can now see the leadership in Arabic nations fostering. Turn your values right side up.
