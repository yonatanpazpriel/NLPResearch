It has come to our attention that recent legislation promoting ethnic studies as mandatory requirements for graduation in secondary and state colleges and universities in California does not include modules and coursework studying antisemitism, Jewish history and the democratic State of Israel. We fervently and vehemently reject the lack of inclusion of the above topics in the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. As retired educators, proud American and California citizens, we cannot sit idly by as decisions are made negating and rejecting virulent extremism and anti-semitism in our midst. During the past two years our beloved country and state have witnessed a dramatic increase in anti-semitic incidents resulting in death; Charlottesville, VA and Pittsburgh, PA and here on our doorstep in Poway,CA. Jewish innocents have died and been killed by horrible fanatics who now feel no regret about their actions emboldened by Washington, D.C. extremism and ignorance. If you do not include the study of anti-semitism as a hate crime in your curriculum, the unfortunate murder and killing of Jews because they are Jewish from the beginning of time and the objective assessment of Israel as the only democratic nation in the Near East where people are free to vote and choose, you will be promoting racism and discrimination!! As taxpaying citizens of our great state of California for over 50 years, we urge you to act quickly and decisively to amend the master plan of ethnic studies to include materials on anti-semitism, the Jewish faith and the State of Israel. The Jewish population of the United States of America is less than two percent. Jewish people are a minority in our country and state. Together, we stand in making California a place where all are respected and feel safe. Please do the right thing and include the study of anti-semitism, the study of Jewish history and a full appreciation and understanding of Israel among the nations in your ethnic studies curriculum. Thank you.
