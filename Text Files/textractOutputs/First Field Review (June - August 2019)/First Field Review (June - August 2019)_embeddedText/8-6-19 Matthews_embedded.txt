From: Milo Matthews Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 2:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Inclusion of Arab Studies in Ethnic Studies curriculum
To whom it may concern:
� I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.
� I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
� Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
Thank you. I feel very passionately about this issue.
