To the California Department of Education: The proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum, as written, ignores one ethnic group: American Jews. The Curriculum erases the long history of Jews in the United States. It lumps Jews in as a subset of Europeans, not acknowledging that they were hated, marginalized, and "ethnically cleansed" (to use a modern term) through the centuries/millenia. Calling Jews "Europeans" also denies the existence of other Jews, such as the "Mizrachi" Jews in Arab countries or the Ethiopian Jews. The Glossary does not include Anti-Semitism/Jew-hatred. Anti-Semitism is real, although the proposed Curriculum ignores it. Whether from politically powerful Congressmembers like Rep. Ilhan Omar, evil white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan, or day-to-day bigotry like the classmate who called my daughter a "rich bitch Jew" ï¿½ Jew hatred is alive and well in this country. The glaring omission of Jews as an at-risk ethnic minority and anti-Semitism/Jew-hatred as a dangerous ideology reminds me of the discussion about language in 1984 (George Orwell's terrifying book about totalitarianism):
"Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? ... Every year fewer and fewer words, and the range of consciousness always a little smaller." The Ethnic Studies Curriculum states "...this course aims to provide an emancipatory education that will inspire students to critically engage in self-determination and seek social justice for all." I hope that the California Board of Education will redesign the Curriculum to welcome all ethnicities and support everyone's right to understanding and respect. Thank you. Michal Amir Salkin
