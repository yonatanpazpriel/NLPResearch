From: SUE ANN Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 7:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: sue scheck Subject: The New Proposed Curriculum
Good Evening,
Sue Ann Scheck here. I am deeply concerned about the new Ethnic Studies Curriculum in that it promotes boycotts against Israel. It goes on to omit ANTISEMITISM as a form of bigotry.
Ultimately the exclusion of antisemitism as an evil takes no account of the lessons we have learned from the Holocaust ! The Second World War and its Victimization of Jews must never be forgotten lest it is repeated.
World WAR II, and the sacrifice of the lives of our Military, must remain a significant area of study in our schools.
Please remove BDS and Other anti Israel bias from the Curriculum. They put Jewish Children....perhaps All Children....at risk.
This Ethnic Studies Curriculum is a recipe for HATE....Plain and Simple! It seeks to divide Us !
Are we unable to see that Malice towards the Other has reached Epidemic Proportions? Why introduce it in our Schools?
Mine is a Holocaust Family. Please Care..
Sue Ann Scheck
