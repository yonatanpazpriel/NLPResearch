This curriculum appears to be more propaganda than a factual presentation. It is biased and attempts to tell or sway the student in a particular political and social direction. It does not attempt to broaden a student's prospective. The social movements students are directed to are one-sided � obviously affected by the views of its authors rather than a more neutral presentation. It is anti-semitic, referring in a positive way to the BDS movement without mentioning the views of those that disagree with it or its tactics. It neglects to mention Jews as an ethnic minority deserving of protection when attacks on Jews have increased dramatically over the past years. It seems to equate capitalism with oppression � and although certainly the way it is practiced today as unfettered capitalism (as opposed to the capitalism of Adam Smith � who said capitalism must serve society), does indeed contribute to oppression. But that is not true capitalism � there are other views.

I am a liberal democrat and a card carrying member of the ACLU. This curriculum is an embarrassment to the CA Dept of Education and should be torn up and discarded as the one-sided and biased screed that it is. It treads a dangerous path!
