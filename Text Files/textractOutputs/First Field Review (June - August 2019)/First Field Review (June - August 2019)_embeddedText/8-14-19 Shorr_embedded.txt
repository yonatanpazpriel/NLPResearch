From: Talia Landau Shorr Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: opposition to Board of Education curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing to express my opposition to the new proposed curriculum on ethnic studies on account of it's extremely biased political views.
I will reference the letter that my rabbi has already sent, because his words sum up anything better than what I can say, but please take into consideration his peace-loving words.
Best, Talia L. Shorr, MD
Dear Instructional Quality Commission, California Department of Education, and State Board of Education:
I am writing as the rabbi of B'nai David-Judea, a Jewish congregation in Los Angeles. I commend the Board of Education for mandating a new Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California's High Schools. But the draft under consideration will, I believe and fear, likely aggravate and throw fuel onto the growing fire of antiSemitism and anti-Israel sentiment in our State. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is tragic and complex, and is not reducible to a rap song about Israeli aggression. Similarly, endorsement of the BDS movement, which is rooted in the philosophy that the State of Israel simply shouldn't exist, is an implicit legitimization of AntiSemitism, as it sanctions the claim that the Jewish people has no right to a state of its own.
Our Jewish community would welcome the opportunity to have a seat at the table as a new and better draft curriculum is devised. The current is unacceptably flawed, and will result in the opposite of the intended result, fanning hatred and discrimination, rather than fostering understanding and harmony.
Respectfully submitted, Rabbi Yosef Kanefsky
