I read chapter 2. I object to the one-sided depiction of Israel and Palestine. Rather than have a surreptitious program that teaches bigotry against Jews, save California money and just teach the Protocols of the Elders of Zion or Mein Kampf. That way you don't have to spend my tax dollars on a supposed neutral curriculum that teaches bigotry. The professors in California's higher education system have shown multiple times where their sympathies lie. It is one-sided against Jews and Israel.
