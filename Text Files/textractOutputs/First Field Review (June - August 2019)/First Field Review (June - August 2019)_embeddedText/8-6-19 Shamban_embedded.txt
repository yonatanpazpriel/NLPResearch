To whom it may concern:
I am a member of the Jewish community. I am a strong supporter of Ethnic Studies in California public high schools. This includes curriculum which the Arab American community believes to be important. It is critical that students learn about issues of race, class and gender. The benefits of Ethnic Studies have been well documented including better student academic performance, and higher graduation and college enrollment rates. It is important that students of different cultures see themselves reflected in the learning environment. It indicates that their culture is respected and they are included which leads to a much better learning environment. The Ethnic Studies curriculum also exposes students of different cultures in a respectful way giving them a new appreciation and understanding of their fellow students and communities.
