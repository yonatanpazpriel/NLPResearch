Hello,
It has come to my attention that the committee developing, with intent to pass, a curriculum for ethnic studies has a bias in the subject matter. While the BDS movement has gained traction on very liberal campuses across this country it would be a terrible mistake to portray Israel in the light in which this movement is framed.
I was the first chair of the circle of trustees with one of the very first Charter Schools in California when the original fifty were granted. The Santa Barbara Charter School was one of two that created its school rather than converting from existing public schools and I can say that we established the curriculum without bias. The school has celebrated its 26th anniversary.
My concern is any language or content which portrays the Palestinians as the unwilling victims of policies of Israel. I am in my early 70's and was born the year before Israel became a State. Palestinians have had the same number of years to flourish and there was a time that a real peace was offered which their leader Yasser Arafat rejected.
By creating any curriculum that does not address fairly the opportunities and challenges and how the parties have addressed them is in my judgment irresponsible and not useful. Certainly discussion needs to take place as all good teachings will do that but it has to be based upon a fair and balanced curriculum at the start.
I believe the State of California is very progressive and as a citizen for 40 years in California the State has led the country in so many positive ways. I hope that the committee will see the content is as important as the intent to educate and inform and not to persuade students through a bias.
Thank you for listening.
