From: Kara Silverstein Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Please Revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am disturbed and upset by the improper slant of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have two grade school children who attend public school (Stevenson PACT in Mountain View) in the State of California. Having grown up as one of two Jewish kids (out of a class of 365) in at my public school in North Carolina, it is extremely important to me that my kids feel recognized and included in the history they are taught in the school system. However the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. This exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
I'm surprised and deeply disappointed that you would choose to ignore the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture and government, as well as our longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination. This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism - despite the fact that hate crimes against Jews significantly outnumber Islamophobic incidents.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Kara Silverstein
