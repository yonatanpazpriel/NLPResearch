From: J.B. Alderman Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 9:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies ; hello; assemblymember.wicks; senator.skinner Subject: Anti-Jewish bias
Dear CDE -- I have read the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and I am deeply concerned about the clear anti-Jewish bias in the material. Please scrap this version and go back to the drawing board with a more diverse set of contributors that does not marginalize the Jewish contribution nor reinforce hateful stereotypes about Jews.
