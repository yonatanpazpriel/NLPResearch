From: David Cowan Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please re-draft to avoid perpetuating false myths
From what I can tell from news articles, the curriculum provides simplistic and erroneous opinions about Judaism, Jewish people and the historic difficulties between Israel and its neighbors. It is very unfortunate that this ill informed bias is coming from our state government - one of the few places left in the world where people can determine the truth themselves without state indoctrination. Teach children how to think; not what to think. By this sort of proposed language, California falls prey to the very criticisms made of other governments that teach falsehoods. Let's keep California as a paradigm for educational excellence and take the time to get this important subject taught right.
Thank you for your consideration.
