From: Susan Feist Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:48 PM To: Superintendent; Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed ESMC Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am very concerned and upset by the proposed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but strongly urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have grandchildren in the California public school system. It would be horrifying for them to be taught this flawed curriculum, omitting and denigrating the Jewish experience and point of view . Not to mention teaching these outrageous concepts to all of California's students.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's long standing struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
� This is indefensible in light of rising anti-Semitism in America and especially on college campuses.
� The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the anti-Semitic BDS movement. As Asad AbuKalil, Professor of Political Science and BDS leader at the University of California has said, "The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel."
Please, please make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Susan Feist, San Carlos, CA
