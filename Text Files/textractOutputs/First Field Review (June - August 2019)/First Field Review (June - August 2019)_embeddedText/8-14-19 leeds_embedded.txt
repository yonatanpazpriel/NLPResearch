Dear Educators,
It is important for you to understand that as a Jewish community we are already marginalized and the number one minority who are targeted by hate crimes. We can not possibly put any more security guards in front of our children's schools or our synagogues as our places of worship. In this climate of hate and anti-semitism coupled with gun violence and accessibility to guns, Jews are once again terrified to be Jewish let alone wearing a Kippah or anything that will endanger our lives or the lives of our children. We have already run from persecution and genocide in country after country. In fact, I myself am a grateful citizen who was accepted to America when Egypt chased us out for being Jewish. I was the youngest of three children. We are all grateful Americans and all we ask from our beloved America is the ability to live and raise our children in safety.
Please do not promote any agenda or curriculum that will increase the hate and intolerance for our families. We have rights to simply live and what has been proposed would endanger our lives again.
It is not me who predicts that, it is the past and all that we have experienced that knows this truth all too well. Please keep us safe in the country that we call home and that we love.
Respectfully, Dina Leeds
