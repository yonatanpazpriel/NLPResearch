I am in opposition to the proposed model curriculum for three reasons:

1. As written, the listed recommendations would require a time intensive format. Some compromise will (must) be placed on current courses to accommodate the introduction and future maintenance of the proposed program. To provide all students with skills necessary to compete in our constantly advancing and developing job market, knowledge of math, science, English, computer skills, history/geography and language studies (ie, Spanish, French, etc.) are mandatory. An Ethnic Studies curriculum, as proposed, would not provide an equal benefit. We should not compromise the former for the sake of the latter.

2. I am troubled to read on line #27 of the introductory chapter, that white supremacy is the first-listed cause of oppression among non-whites in America. Such rhetoric is divisive; creating an us-against-them mentality. White children in California's schools should not be blamed for unfortunate events that happened in the days of their great-great-great grandparents.

3. Recorded on lines 441/2/3 are recommendations to place students in "action projects" in which they will use their "voices" to affect "social transformation."

As mentioned in my first point, such projects will pull students away from their primary reason for attending school; education. Please do not confuse education with social transformation.

At its heart, the model curriculum appears to be one of social manipulation. This should not be the focus of our teachers/administrators. Requiring students to spell history as hxrsory will accomplish nothing but confusion among children and their parents. It really serves no practical purpose.

If we provide quality education for all of our children, every ethnicity in California will have fair access to the careers they desire.

Respectfully, Chris Vaughan
