Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 268 line 5802 � makes a tacit assumption that terrorists are political prisoners rather murderers of civilians. Diversity is to acknowledge all sides. Further the whole song does nothing to demonstrate the benefits of diversity in making California great! Page 234 � the BDS movement is an international issue with two sides to the story. It is not a California story Page 267 � line 5774 diversity curriculum is to find reasons to appreciate those who came here not whther the ones who stayed behind are politically persecuted Introduction � In teaching diversity, the lack of material regarding the positive contribution that Jewish citizens have made to California is a glaring omission. In these times when we need to teach respect for all those who are "other", this is something that need be included
