From: David Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 12:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Some comments on the ESMC
By way of introduction, I strongly support the intent of AB 331 and a renewed HS ethnic studies curriculum, but I also strongly object to the bias in the language and choice of words regarding Jews and Israel in the resulting Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
The document blatantly exhibits a bias that appears to be prevalent among Californian and American liberals.
The document ignores the centuries of anti-semitism in the state, nation, and world, and reiterates prevalent stereotypical impressions of Jews and Jewish "power" in Californian, American, and world society. It also exhibits a one-sided distorted picture of Israel as the "Aggressor," ignoring over seventy years of horrific anti-Israel (read "anti-Jewish") actions by the surrounding Arab nations and the Palestinians against a tiny minority.
I strongly urge that the ESMC be reviewed and modified by a committee including a representative number of ethnic members before it is approved.
If the document is not revised to either include a factual basis for its biased opinions or revisions to those opinions, I do not back the passage of the bill, and will contact Governor Gavin Newsom to veto it.
