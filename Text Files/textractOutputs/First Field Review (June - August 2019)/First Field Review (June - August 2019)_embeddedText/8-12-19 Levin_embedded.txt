-----Original Message----From: Fred levin Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 5:53 PM To: CFIRD Subject: Ethnic Studies Requirement for California High School Students
Ethnic studies is a waste of resources , especially given the Jewish experience in America which is not realistically addressed . The bigots and left wingers who put these guidelines together miss the true point. These studies will promote separation of communities . In essence identity politics.
I would recommend that CDE require a heavy dose of American Civics study. Americans are members of one country. One people who are guided by the Constitution. This should be the requirement for graduation from high school and not ethnic studies.
