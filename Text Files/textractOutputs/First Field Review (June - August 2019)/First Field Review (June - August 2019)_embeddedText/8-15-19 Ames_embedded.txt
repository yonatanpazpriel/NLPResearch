I have reviewed the sample course models. I applaud the effort to recognize the contributions of all the citizens of California to our culture, and I believe systemic injustices should be recognized and addressed. However, I have serious doubts about this proposed course of study. 1) It is too detailed. Students already have a huge amount of information they are supposed to absorb and be able to show they have learned it via testing. Such a detailed course is best studied at the college level. 2) Social Studies teachers already integrate many of these concepts as they are presenting the current curriculum. 3) I worry that it will foster more division between ethnic groups because of a lack of examples of how people of different ethnic groups have found common ground from which they have been able to unite and help their communities in general. Relatedly, I see over-generalizations in the examples, and I can't find any indication that most individuals do indeed have personal agency, the exercise of which is able to transcend whatever lack of privilege exists for them. 4) I worry that students whose reasoning abilities are not yet fully mature (see the many studies on brain development) will misapprehend the scope of this curriculum and neglect to do their own further research. Some communities and individuals may not fit the narrow template of the kinds of situational examples given in the course.

For these reasons, I ask the DOE and IQC to re-think what they actually want High School students to learn. My hope is that, since this is a state mandate, a short curriculum unit appropriate for high schoolers can be inserted into the current Social Studies curriculum. I hope such a unit will emerge that is both honest with facts and provides a basis for learning about other ethnicities with a view toward finding empathy and commonality, not fostering more division. Thank you.
