Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am troubled by a number of aspects of the proposed because I think they reflect bias against the Jewish community and against the state of Israel.

Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum:

�

A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott,

Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose

of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid

conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical

perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

(Glossary attached for reference)

�

The sample lesson plans for the curriculum (attached as reference):

�

Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called

Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p.

234).

�

Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop

terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S.

policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

�

Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is

an Arab country (p. 237).

�

Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no

alternative perspectives (p. 242).

�

Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of

Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or

criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The

implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to...

enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and

inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this

stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish

community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and

ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the

exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

- I am urging the state to remove all discussion in the curriculum regarding the

BDS movement, which is an organization rooted in divisive and hateful

propaganda, or at least to provide a truly balanced curriculum reflecting both

sides of the narrative. And I am urging the state to add lessons about American

Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in

the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
