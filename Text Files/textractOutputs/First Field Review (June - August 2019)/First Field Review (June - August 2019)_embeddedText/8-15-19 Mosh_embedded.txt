to the Advisory Tesm My name is Adene Mosh. I am a mother, grandmother and a product of the California public school system. These changes are of great concern to me... The term Anti-Semitism needs to be defined as a prejudicial ideology against Jews. to leave it out is a disservice to all those who have experienced it first hand and those who perished for not other reason than they were Jews. BDS is not only highly controversial but is a group the perpetuates violence. To include BDS and omit Anti-semitism is clearly a bias that cannot be what we want to pass along to our youth. And last, certainly not least, Israel is Israel, not Israel-Palestine or Palestine-Israel. It is a sovereign nation with all the rights and priviledges that all nations who are ;member of the international community deserve and live up to....hopefully.
I have great concern for the grandchild I have in the the public school system, Jewish children by the way, who will be affect by this biased stance in curriculum and the after affects of how it will give sanction to AntiSemitism and other offensive ideologies.
Best Regards, Adene Mosh
