Dear Kevin,
I am a parent with children in the CA school system and had the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum brought to my attention from another concerned parent. After browsing through the 300 pages it becomes very clear to me this curriculum is nothing more than leftist propaganda intended to create more "victims", which will in turn become activists for social justice (aka the Democrat party). This is NOT what schools are about!
There is nothing of worth in this curriculum except to turn innocent children into activists so I am 100% against the entire curriculum.
If this gets passed I will, for the first time in my life, work with other groups to organize a protest of concerned parents. This protest will not be a bunch of sign holders picketing in front of schools. Instead, it will be a week where parents keep their kids out of school, as this is the only way the schools will take notice.
Stop using our schools to indoctrinate children! They need to learn all the basics like reading, writing, arithmetic, history and science, NOT social justice content intended to sow division and get kids to side with a particular political party.
Sincerely, A VERY concerned parent
