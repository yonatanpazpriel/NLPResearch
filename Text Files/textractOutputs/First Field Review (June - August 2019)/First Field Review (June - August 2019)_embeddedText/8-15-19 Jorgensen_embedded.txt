I support the inclusion of material on Jews and anti-Semitism. Jews have so often been safe at one time and place only to find their property and/or bodies in great danger shortly thereafter. I could accept leaving a portion open for coverage of a European group selected by the teacher. I oppose including a number of European ethnicities as in the past several decades discrimination has been oriented towards people of color, not European ethnicities. I was not able to locate discussions of Israel and I hear comments were due in today. I would say only that given that so much more money is spent on Israel and Israel has so much stronger defense assistance commitments from the U. S., holding Israel to a higher standard than countries who receive so much less money and defense support is absolutely reasonable.
