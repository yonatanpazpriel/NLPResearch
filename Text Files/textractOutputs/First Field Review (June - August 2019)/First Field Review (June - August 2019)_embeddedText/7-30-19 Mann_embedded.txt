From: steve Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 8:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Ladies and Gentlemen, I am writing to ask that you reject the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. My wife and I strongly believe it is one-sided, misguided, and does not fairly and equitably reflect social history.
While we understand that it is "a guide," we believe such a piece of biased curriculum has no place in our schools.
Please reject the proposed text. Thanks you.
Steve and Jill Mann
