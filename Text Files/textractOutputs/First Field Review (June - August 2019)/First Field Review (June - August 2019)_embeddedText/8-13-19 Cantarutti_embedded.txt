While I understand the need for teaching kids about the wide content put forth in the outline, who I worry about is the young, impressionable Caucasian boys. They are put at the bottom of the identity politic pyramid. By putting them in a class where they are labeled as "privileged," even if they are poor and come from a broken home can do no good. They could become a suicide risk, or worse, if they are made to feel this way.
As far as transgender studies go, that is a fine concept as far as it goes. However, chromosomes do not lie, and gender and biological sex must be separated.
Finally, in your list of oppressed groups, I do not see Jewish people. Why is that? They are the number one recipients of hate crimes in the nation.
Thank you
