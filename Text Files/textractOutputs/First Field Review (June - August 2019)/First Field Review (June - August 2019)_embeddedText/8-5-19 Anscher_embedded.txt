Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Mr. McDonald, I am urging you to make sure that there is a balanced presentation of the relations between Israel and its Palestinian neighbors. The history of this area is highly nuanced and complicated. While I am critical of many of the political decisions made by the Israeli government, I am also fearful that many Americans translate this political problem into a justification for antisemitism. It is now fashionable on both the right and the left to engage in antiSemitic rhetoric and--as we saw in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania not long ago--to follow-up this rhetoric with violence. Please remember that your curriculum will effectively be indoctrinating children into what to think about a very complicated situation. Please be careful not to translate that into a message that it is okay to hate the Jews. Perhaps you should take a look at the materials put out by the Southern Poverty Law Center about anti-semitism; you will see that the Jews are at the top of the hate list of white supremacists because the white supremacists believe that the Jews are solely responsible for promoting immigration and civil rights in this country. It would be a shame for the children of California to be taught to hate an ethnic minority that has been at the forefront of encouraging inclusivity.
