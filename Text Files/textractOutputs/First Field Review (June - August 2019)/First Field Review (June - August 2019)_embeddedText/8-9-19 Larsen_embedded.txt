From: Martha Larsen Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 5:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies are important
It is both shocking and sad that there is not an open discussion of BDS which is not antiSemitic. It might be anti-Israel state, but not anti-Semitic. Sooner or later students will realize that they are being politically indoctrinated to adopt a view of Israel and its Jewish supporters that are part of a system of oppression and privileged. Those who have cheated of the truth will ultimately not be supporters of Israel or of the Jewish people. I support Ethnic Studies in California public high schools, including curriculum that the Arab American community believes to be important. It is critical that students learn about issues of race, class and gender. The benefits of Ethnic Studies have been well documented including better student academic performance, and higher graduation and college enrollment rates.
