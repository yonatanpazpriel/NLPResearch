Dear ESMC Representative,
In a vital time in our American History, we are striving to move upward in recognizing and respecting Americans from ALL backgrounds. The Californian American Jewish Community should be represented fairly and accurately without prejudice. Please review the examples below. The ESMC Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience: Despite the significant contributions that Jews have made to California history, politics, culture and government � and the Jewish community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � Jews are essentially omitted as an ethnic group in the ESMC.
The ESMC Omits Anti-Semitism: While the ESMC specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of anti-Semitism. The ESMC Glossary includes the terms Racism, Sexism, Anthropocentrism, Cisheteropatriarchy, Heteropatriarchy, Classism, Colonialism, Homophobia, Imperialism, Islamophobia, Patriarchy, Transphobia, White Supremacy, and Xenophobia. It does not include the term Anti-Semitism.
The ESMC Denigrates Jews: In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture" � a classic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews control the media.
The ESMC Singles Out Israel for Condemnation: The ESMC promotes the anti-Semitic, antiIsrael Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and singles out Israel � the only Jewish state in the world � for special criticism and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. Andria Kaye Fresno, California
