From: Scheder, Constantin Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 10:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Critique
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am outraged that the State of California endorses such a one-sided, socialist curriculum for all of our students. It seems like only the far-left views and opinions are expressed in this curriculum versus a balanced liberal and conservative view.
For example, capitalism is hardly "a form of power and oppression" ï¿½ rather it has brought wealth, wellbeing, and large numbers of value-priced choices (e.g., Amazon, Walmart, Costco) to billions of peoples in the world and has created sovereign states with the highest living standards, least corruption, and most liberal freedom-of-speech laws.
I would strongly encourage you to make some major revisions to this curriculum to provide our vulnerable and receptive students with more balanced views, which encourage discussion, questions, and a better understanding of everyday life.
Respectfully, Constantin Scheder
