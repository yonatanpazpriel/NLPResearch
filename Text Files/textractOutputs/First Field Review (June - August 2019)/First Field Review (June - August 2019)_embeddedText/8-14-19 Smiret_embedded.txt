The persons who were most instrumental in writing the ethnic studies curriculum exercised bias and very poor standards in what they wanted to be taught in the classrooms.Those persons need to be replaced.
When I was in elementary school we did celebrate some religious holidays together in school and learned about each other by so doing. The experiences were not detrimental. They were helpful and positive. They did not teach hate.,
it is commendable, not negative for people to learn to engage in capitalism and economics. This is not "racist". It is important to graduate high school and have some idea as to what it takes to live in our society and make head ways. It would be helpful .to have a class where students are encouraged to develop skills that would help them to succeed and sometimes use unusual methodologies when needed to get to their goals.. I had tenants who were moving out and buying a house with another couple as it was too expensive otherwise. Their goal was to get the house, save, and eventually save enough to enable each couple to have their own home..
Economics and capitalism go hand and hand. A class is needed to learn how to budget, use a check book, learn what costs are now, what type of a career that they are interested in and what life style they would have by their choices. It would emphasize the need to take the opportunities available to achieve the results that they would like to have. High school should bring realism into the picture.
