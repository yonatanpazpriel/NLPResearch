To: Superintendent Thurmond, President Darling-Hammond, Vice-President Straus, and Member Ortiz-Licon
I appreciate the announcement and letter regarding further development and review the future Ethnic Studies Curriculum in the state of California. Current portions of that curriculum are very divisive and even have examples of very negative stereotypes of the Jewish people. The purpose of this curriculum should be to celebrate and recognize the contribution of a wide variety of people with different ethnic backgrounds. Again I appreciate that there will be an in depth review and development of this curriculum.
Sincerely, Greg Hubbs President Congregation B'nai Israel Sacramento, Ca.
