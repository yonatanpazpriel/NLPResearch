Page # 1 lines 10-18: "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to develop culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining, help schools better connect with native students and students of color, equip all students with the skills and knowledge to think critically about the world around them and to tell their own stories, empower students to be engaged socially and politically, enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism. In essence, Ethnic Studies helps improve the U.S. democracy by encouraging the participation of all students at all political, social, and economic levels."

The fact that in the 21st century and after two consecutive terms of a African/Black American POTUS there is still a need to plead for the implementation of "culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies" equitably, is the clearest indication that white supremacy is in this country, not a thing of the past, and a post-racial society we are not. Our current POTUS is proof that our country is even further away from any real or imagined post-racial era than ever before. It is in fact deplorable to be resistant to the concepts of the curricular content stated above and be an educator or advocate for education in this country. There is absolutely no decent and humane reasoning for not implementing this ethnic studies curriculum model. The present culture of our U.S. education system represents a monocultural paradigm by over-privileging whiteness via an ethnocentric perspective. To be clear, I do not treat the signifiers "Eurocentrism," "white," and "American" interchangeably but rather, I use them mutually exclusively to acknowledge the cultural racism fundamental to Eurocentrism; and whiteness as a social construct intended to invisiblize the creolization of the collective identity of American culture. The U.S. education system's historical model of "monocultural single-system courses that are requiring students of all ethnicities to imagine that the essential insights into human thought, labor, imagination, and care can all be found in the study of Caucasian people" is a problem that is beyond address, and it must be met with urgent resolve (McIntosh 1990, 8). monocultural curricular models must be discouraged and ultimately dismantled
