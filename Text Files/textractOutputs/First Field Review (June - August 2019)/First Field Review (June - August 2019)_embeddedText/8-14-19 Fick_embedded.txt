I am writing this directly as I cannot download and use the provided template or copy and paste it.
The entire curriculum as posted online is biased and unacceptable. It shows an extreme political agenda being pushed in our schools rather than any concern with education or preparing our children for college, employment or living in the adult world. I am especially concerned at the inclusion of a required "Community Engagement/Action Project" as stated. This is blatant forced indoctrination as students will undoubtedly feel pressure to validate their teachers stated concerns in order to receive good grades. This entire curriculum needs to be scrapped and redone with; more explanation of what would be taught at each grade level, presenting unbiased information, using clear language, and NO political agenda.
This curriculum is an abomination and the entire Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee should be ashamed of themselves.
Thank you, L. Fick
