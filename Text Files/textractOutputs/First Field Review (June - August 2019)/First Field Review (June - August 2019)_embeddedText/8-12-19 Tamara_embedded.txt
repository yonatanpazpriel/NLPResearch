Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. � This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. � The ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to anti-Semitism. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement. As Asad AbuKalil, Professor of Political Science and BDS leader at the University of California has said, "The real aim of BDS is to bring down the State of Israel."
� As a senior I have personally experienced family annihilation in the Holocaust, and violence to Jews throughout this Country. Violence against Jews is part of history and unfortunately on the rise as individuals have become more polarized in recent years. Tolerance and understanding come through education and good learning experiences. As a former educator we have the responsibility to accurately educate and foster inclusion for all individuals.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Abigayil Tamara, MA, MSW
