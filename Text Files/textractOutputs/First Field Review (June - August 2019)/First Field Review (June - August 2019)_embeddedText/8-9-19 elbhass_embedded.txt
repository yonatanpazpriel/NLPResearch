I urge you to approve the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the Ethnic Studies curriculum. We are a community that is not well represented in academia or culture in the US. It important that our voice, stories, narratives and history are made relevant in mainstream US culture. Programs like this one will help do that. Our humanization in the long run will also help protect us and allow us to further integrate.

In particular, I support the objectives listed on page 233, outlining the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and creating links between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
