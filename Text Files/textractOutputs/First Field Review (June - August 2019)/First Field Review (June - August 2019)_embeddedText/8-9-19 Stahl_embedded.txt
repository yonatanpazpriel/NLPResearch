I am so happy there will be a course concerning the experience of marginalized communities. Unfortunately, it appears that there is bias against Jews and against Israel in the curriculum. While we clearly need to teach our children about the Palestinian experience, the experience of the Jews must not be minimized. While they have experienced much public success, and while most Jews are white-skinned, the Jews are a historically marginalized community that continues to be marginalized to greater extents in these times under Donald Trump, and it would be appreciated for them to be mentioned in the curriculum. I'm afraid that if the Palestinian viewpoint is the only one provided, that we will be raising individuals who will have a bias against Jews and unconsciously promote antisemitism. So please include information that respects both sides of a difficult historical situation. Thank you. Includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel: "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" fails to include that a stated goal of much of the movement is actually to end the existence of the State of Israel.

Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242 lines 5154-5163).
