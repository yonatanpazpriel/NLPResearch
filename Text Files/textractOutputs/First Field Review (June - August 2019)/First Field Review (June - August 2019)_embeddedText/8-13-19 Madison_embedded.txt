The Model Curriculum Draft Documents (the "Draft") can be summarized - with roughly the same adherence to historical accuracy as displayed in the Draft as follows:
In the Fall of 1969, a UC Berkeley sophomore attended a SDS/Weather Underground rally where he smoked a joint. He then ate fish Tacos for dinner, followed by Tequila shots. He then ingested some Peyote during a dorm room discussion on the need to overthrow the bourgeois pigs in an urban revolution allied with the Black Panthers. Finally, he retreated to his own dorm room and sat at his desk intent on writing an anti-U.S. polemic on intellectuals allying themselves to third world liberation movements. Overcome by nausea, he vomited on a blank sheet of paper.

Passed out for roughly 48 hours, the sophomore neglected to clean up his mess and the vomit congealed and dried on the paper. At the end of the semester, the paper was packed between some books and forgotten.

By some mysterious process, that paper came to be housed in the Chicago apartment of Bill Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn wedged between a copy of Mao's Little Red Book and Ayer's own Prairie Fire: The Politics of Revolutionary Anti-Imperialism. It stayed there for years in a semi-calcified state entirely uninfluenced by the fall of the Soviet Union and the mountains of condemning evidence unearthed through the opening of communist party archives in Moscow and Beijing.

By another mysterious process, that same paper � without edits or additions has been presented to the California Department of Education as the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft.

The Draft makes a mockery of the decisions of millions of people to immigrate to the United States. Millions and millions of American families took risks, incurred expense and endured hardship to immigrate to the United States seeking a better life.
Why did these millions of immigrants risk so much to come to a country that the Draft describes as fundamentally and systematically oppressive, racist and unfair to people of color?
Why does the Draft not discuss an open and welcoming immigration system that has given rise to a multi-ethnic society with innumerable examples of individual accomplishment and success in all fields of human endeavor?

The Draft embraces a discredited Marxist and anti-American and anti-historical view and analytical framework.
Examples include: - presenting capitalism as a form of "power and oppression" without discussing either its successes or the vast historical failures of alternative economic models including socialism - promoting a concept of collective guilt based on race or class - encouraging classism and class struggle - describing US society as containing ...."interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that impact all people of color" - exhorting students to dismantle white supremacy and institutional racism without discussing what that really is in post-1965 America - encouraging "transformative resistance" with no discussion or acknowledgement of democratic and legal avenues for change
The Draft presents the curriculum as a form of indoctrination into an ideology rather than teaching the real history of America's many ethnic groups.

The Draft is strangely silent on what attracted people from all over the world to immigrate to the U.S. The Draft should incorporate discussion of national characteristics that attracted people to the U.S. from so many different cultures.
Examples of that include: - freedom of worship - freedom of expression - a tradition of limited government - constitutional guarantees with respect to property rights (the 5th amendment) - Legal respect for contracts and economic freedom and autonomy - an independent judiciary - a justice system with established rules of evidence and the right of individuals to face one's accuser in a jury trial - World leading educational opportunities benefitting from a tradition of free and open inquiry devoid from state control related to official ideology - Liberal immigration laws - No laws restricting movement within the country and no laws restricting emigration for those that choose to leave
The Draft should put this into context with comparisons to other countries with open immigration systems that have resulted in high percentages of the population being foreign born. Examples include Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, Singapore and Hong Kong. France, Germany, Switzerland and some of the Scandinavian countries can also be included.
A comparative discussion will show that other countries with successful open immigration systems share many characteristics with the U.S. They are overwhelmingly free market economies and many share with the U.S. an English common law legal tradition.

The Draft is strangely silent on home country conditions and factors that have caused such large scale cross border immigration in the past 60 years.
The Draft should incorporate discussion of home country conditions of war, religious persecution, poverty and political violence that compelled so many people to seek a better future elsewhere.
Examples of that include: - Communism as a totalitarian system that has led to large scale emigration from Eastern Europe, Cuba, China, Vietnam and Cambodia - Communist political violence with campaigns and policies inflicting hardship, incarceration and death based on class, property ownership, religious belief, educational background, ethnic group and political faction (real or perceived) - The comparative lack of success in establishing liberal and prosperous political economies in much of Latin America in spite of world class natural endowments (Argentina and Mexico are prime examples). This track record stands in spite of nearly 200 years of political independence and longer for Haiti.

The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo should be explored with emphasis on: - The provision that allowed Mexican citizens in territory gained by the U.S. to freely choose whether to become U.S. citizens or remain citizens of Mexico - The historical facts about the total population of Mexican citizens in the territory ceded by the Treaty in 1848 - The provision that recognized property rights through land titles resulting from the system of Spanish and Mexican land grants. Indeed, the pattern of California land holding today cannot be understood without reference to the affirmed legal standing of these massive land grants - The fact that ratified treaties are an essential part of the laws of the U.S.
All discussion of MEChA should highlight how the concept of Aztlan promotes a separatist ethno-state based on racial identity
- A plan to realize a separate LatinX state in the U.S. southwest would require treasonous acts against the U.S.
- Precedent for how the U.S. will react to serious secessionist movements was firmly established between 1861-1865
- Communist nations and parties actively promoted separatist political goals amongst U.S. ethnic activist groups in the 1960's

The section on Cambodia typifies the inaccurate and historically deficient work seen throughout the Draft. These inaccuracies portray the Cambodian people as being without agency and simply reactive to the U.S. In fact, the Cambodian political leadership held its own fervent communist ideology. Cambodia's post1975 fate was sealed by the Khmer Rouge's implementation of a radical Maoist form of Communism driven by the ideology of the ruling elite
- Line 3955 � Cambodia was not caught up in the Vietnam war due to "secret bombings". North Vietnam many years prior violated Cambodia's sovereignty by occupying its eastern provinces for the Ho Chi Min trail to provide men and material to support the war against South Vietnam
- Lines 3967-3970 � Pol Pot's actions were not driven by U.S. bombings of the Ho Chi Min trail in eastern Cambodia. His actions in declaring a `year zero', depopulating the cities, outlawing private property and money, suddenly collectivizing agriculture and conducting countless murderous purges were driven by a radical communist ideology that drew inspiration from the Maoist Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution. In fact, thousands of Chinese communist advisors were the only welcome foreign influence in Cambodia during Pol Pot's reign. The Cambodian genocide resulted in the death of roughly 20-25% of the total population
- Lines 3971-3973 � again, people associated with the U.S. were not the primary victims or targets in the Killing Fields. Anybody associated with previous non-communist regimes or thought to represent "old society" were targeted. The Khmer Rouge's active policies - not their reaction to the U.S. - was the cause of the Killing Fields. The main cause of death in the Killing Fields was starvation, exposure, disease and exhaustion. In this respect, the Killing Fields share many similarities with other communist forced collectivizations such as Stalin's 1930's Ukraine famine and the 1959-1962 famine from Mao's Great Leap Forward.

The African American experience is so central and important to U.S. history and so critical to our understanding of citizenship and civil rights, one must question the wisdom of including it in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Will teachers of U.S. history provide a more cursory overview of the African American experience on the assumption that it will be covered more completely in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum? Slavery, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow and Thurgood Marshall arguing desegregation cases in front of the Supreme Court are all mainstream American history. It would be a shame if an unintended consequence of the Draft could lead to deemphasizing this mainstream history with people starting to think of it as a special side-area covered in Ethnic Studies.

Because the vast majority of African Americans descend from people who arrived involuntarily and since slavery existed from early colonial times, their history and experience is unique and long-standing compared to other U.S. ethnic groups. The subject matter and source materials are vast and intertwined with all aspects of U.S. history. (Of course, voluntary immigration over the past 60 years is different and significant and has produced national leaders such as Colin Powell, Kamala Harris and President Obama).

The Draft should present a balanced view of the Black Panthers and groups that embraced communist ideology. For example, Huey Newton described visiting China and meeting with senior communist officials at the height of the Cultural Revolution as providing him with a "sensation of freedom" and convinced him that "an oppressed people can be liberated". Imagine a person travelling to Nazi Berlin in 1943 and using the same language. Would that person and their political organization be included in the Draft? Never was a society less free and liberated than Cultural Revolution China. Roughly 10 million died in the Cultural Revolution, which followed 45 million dead in the Great Leap and roughly 10 million dead in "land reform" from 1949-1957.
