To Whom it may concern. I am attaching my comments on the ethnic studies curriculum. I support with our reservation, the inclusion of specific teaching of the history of Arab Americans. As a member of a marginalized group myself as a lesbian, I understand the need for strong programs that counter the bigoted ideologies so pervasive, in particular anti Arab racism and Islamophobia. Thank you Victoria Becker

Page1 Arab and Pacific Islanders are underrepresented and marginalized communities in California and for that reason should be specifically included in this ethnic studies curriculum.
Page 233. In the current climate of heightened white supremacy in particular anti Arab racism it is important to include the teaching of the history of Arabs and Arab Americans in California's public schools to combat this increasingly vitriolic form of discrimination.
Page 236, It is important to teach a history of the migration Arab Americans, a marginalized group, to help create a bridge between migrant groups. It is especially important to include this history of Arab Americans because of the heightened anti Arab racism now pervasive in the media and fueled by a rise in white nationalist ideology, encouraged by the current republican administration.
