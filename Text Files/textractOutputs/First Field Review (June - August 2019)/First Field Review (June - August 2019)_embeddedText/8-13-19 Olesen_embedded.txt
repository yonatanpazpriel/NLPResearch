From: Sandy Olesen Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies mandatory
Dear Board,
I would like to ask you not to mandate ethnic studies in California high school and at Cal State University. From what I have read it looks like it will be a podium for bigoted racist anti-Semitic courses in our public schools.
We do not have enough qualified teachers for the classes already mandated for our kids to take prior to and in college. Students are having to stay in college longer because they cannot get the classes that are already needed for graduation.
In today's schools we already have teachers with agendas forcing their ideas on the students. Ethnic studies coursework can be riddled with slanted views of society and the ideal that you are a victim and should do something about.
We have no problem with ethnic studies classes being available--we just do not want them mandated for graduation. We grew up in California schools when Black and Brown studies courses became available and were taught without political pressure. If you wanted to take them you could. You know in today's schools many people are pressured if they do not agree with a political slant of a teacher or professor. Grades can depend on how your professor views your opinion on hot bed issues. It is not appropriate to mandate young people to take classes with a teacher with a known "slant" to their philosophy.
In a day and age when basic classes are not available you do not need to add another questionable mandated course.
Please reconsider this course of action and think of the students, Allow them to decide if they want to take this course or not. Most students with parents who care about their future will already be teaching them to treat all people as they want to be treated regardless of their ethnicity, religion or gender.
Thank you for listening.
Mr. and Mrs. Jon Olesen Montebello, California
