From: GT Haff Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 1:14 AM To: CFIRD Subject: The Lies of Capitalism in our upcoming curriculum and major sex education changes
I recently heard that California hopes to drastically change our curriculum in two areas. When I was in high school and college, I had a class that discussed the pros and cons of capitalism, communism, and socialism. My teachers stressed that our country was based on capitalism. With hard work, dependability, saving, and luck a person could get ahead and possibly make a good living. But they also taught its problems. Most of them were against communism in the sixties, and they skimmed over socialism since few countries were governed under it. Today I'd like to know which country is the model for socialism, certainly not Venezuela. I'm a bit old school so I don't think that if people get decent paychecks from the government, that they would want to work. I've been reading about gamers in the newspaper. I know that California and most teachers here are democratic. However, I don't think it's the teachers responsibility to sway our students into any opinion. As far as sex education, teachers again can present certain subjects like BLG at the proper time which should be middle school. Leave this topic to the parents at earlier ages. Teachers should model and teach tolerance at every grade, but certain details should be left to the parents. I'm speaking, by the way, as a retired teacher and democrat.
If both of these changes pass, please send me a copy of the curriculum which deals with these areas.
