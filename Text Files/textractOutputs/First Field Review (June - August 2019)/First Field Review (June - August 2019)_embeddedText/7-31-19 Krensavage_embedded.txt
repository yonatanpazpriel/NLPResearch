Capitalism is described as a "form of power and oppression," alongside "patriarchy," "racism," "white supremacy" and "ableism." Capitalism and capitalists appear as villains several times in the document. I respectfully disagree with this guide. Capitalism should not be portrayed to the students of California in this manner. I believe Capitalism is the ONLY moral social system for humanity. Capitalism is responsible for the amazing success of the United States. Capitalism enabled the United States to become the most prosperous nation on earth in only 243 years.
