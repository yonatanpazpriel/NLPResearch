From: Rachel Howitt Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 12:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti Semitism
Dear Educators:
Please correct the current curriculum to include tolerance for all religions. I find it unacceptable educating children to tolerate hate and make excuses for their bad behavior. As a tax paying citizen, I would appreciate your consideration of my request.
Thank you,
