Dear Sirs and Madam:
I rigorously oppose your intention to teach that capitalism is not the best solution for eliminating world poverty and enhancing freedom for all who fall under this system. The freedom to dream of having your own company and make what you invented or created is a freedom we cannot afford to lose. The freedom to choose not to participate and live a life free from engagement with corporatism and the pursuit of money is also one that is uniquely capitalistic. Capitalism equals freedom. All other forms of economy, including socialism and communism have a ruling class that determines every person's role and expectations. That is slavery. I understand capitalism has the ability to create economic injustice, but that is an issue we can address if we can get our politicians to stop taking money from these hoarders and limit their ability to steal from the poor and keep the money for themselves. As Winston Churchill once said, "The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings; the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries." If you proceed on your course of action we will move out of the state and take our business to Texas where they value Democracy and Capitalism.
