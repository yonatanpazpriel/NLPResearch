I support the inclusion of Arab American studies and Asian American studies in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. These two communities involvement in broader social movements are often minimized. I think its crucial that students understand the intersectionality between marginalized communities and see how these communities build upon the work of others and work in tandem.
