This study is not only unnecessary, but a dangerous tool to influence our youth. A few very biased individuals are giver the power to alter the viewpoints of a the next generation. It is too much power which does not reflect the truth. Department of education would better spend its time improving the sad statistics of California students math and reading levels and leave the arena of ethnic education to the parents of these children.
