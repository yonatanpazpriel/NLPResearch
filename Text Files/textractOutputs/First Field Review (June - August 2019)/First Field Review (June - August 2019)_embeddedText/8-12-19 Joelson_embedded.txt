California Department of Education, June 2019
I am a taxpayer in California, with an unbroken line of public education from the time I entered kindergarten until the time I graduated medical school. I had always considered my exemplary education to be a reflection of the quality of instruction promoted by the public school system of this State. For that reason, I am chagrined to learn of the content in the proposed, new ethnic studies curriculum (ESMC). Specifically, it has come to my attention that the significant contribution of Jews to the development of this State, and our country generally, has been minimized in the new curriculum. Moreover, while it is currently fashionable to detail insults various ethnic groups have suffered over time, what is known as "the oldest hatred" (anti-Semitism) is ignored.

So in effect your unbalanced curriculum fails in two important respects as it relates to the Jewish nation. On the one hand it does not explain the role antiSemitism has played in Western and Middle-Eastern societies, and at the same time promotes anti-Semitism as it relates to vilification of Jews who have successfully created the only known bulwark against anti-Semitism: Jewish independence in their national homeland. I urge you not to fall prey to short-sighted individuals who have allowed the ESMC to have been co-opted by those who have a political agenda that targets Jews. I do not think this is the lesson that Californians expect their future leaders to be taught within our public school system.
