From: Ronald Dworitz Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Ethnic studies should be part of the school curriculum. However, one country should not be signaled out. The B.D.S. movement only mentions Israel. Many countries treat their citizens horribly. There is no mention of the Arab Countries that treat their females as second class citizens. Many African Nations treat their citizens horribly. This fact is not mentioned. Also, the history of the Palestinian People must be mentioned. In 1948 a two state solution was rejected by the Arab States. Many of us feel that when you unfairly attack Israel, you are committing anti-semetism. Ethnic studies must be balanced, and this part of the curriculum is not balanced.
