Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 1 fails to present a definition of antisemitism while page 2 presents a definition for the Boycott, Divestment & Sanctions movement [BDS] Page 242 employs politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel [lines 5157-61] and pages 268-269 [lines 5802-03] uses antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media and baselessly accuses Israel of colonizing land. I would urge the model curriculum to include lessons on the history of American Jews, an ethnic group, terribly persecuted throughout history, and to avoid succumbing to a one-sided, politically-driven narrative.
