There is no mention whatsoever of Jews, the Jewish people, anti-Semitism, or Israel in this section, yet Jews are an ethnic minority and have been acknowledged as such for centuries in the U.S. and virtually all over the world. Why have we, and the discrimination and violence that we have fought for decades in this country, and for centuries in Europe and in the Middle East, been excluded from the suggested course of study?

Line 4723: "That's where property rights came in. With secure property rights anyone could become successful, from an immigrant Jew like Lionel Cohen and his famous Lionel toy trains to an Austrian bodybuilder-turned-millionaire actor and governor like Arnold Schwarzenegger"... The presence of Jewish immigrants in the U.S. is linked primarily to our desire to earn money. This is perhaps the single oldest trope of anti-Semitism and should be re-phrased.

Line 5143: In the module regarding Arab Americans and their history of immigration to the U.S., there is no inclusion of Jewish immigration except within the context of Aram immigrant: "First wave immigrants were generally called Syrians or Turks, and in fact many did not necessarily think of themselves primarily as Arab. They often identified as members of a particular religious group or geographic area: Christians, Muslims, or Jews, from Lebanon, Aleppo, or Jerusalem." Jews are not Arabs. Nor are Arabs Jews. Our ethnicities are distinct, e.g., the French are a distinct ethnicity from the Spanish.

Line 5561: "Mad dictators, ruthless, violent, treacherous, barbaric, hate Jews and America, secret plots to destroy America." In this model regarding anti-Arab prejudice, Jews are mentioned ONLY in their relation to a plethora of tropes regarding Arabs, and as victims of Arabs.

Line 6238: "The intersectionality and interrelatedness of distinct forms of social oppression in the United States, including anti-Semitism and anti-Arabism"... Here, "anti-Semitism" is merely one of a spectrum of ethnic prejudice, but identified only within that context. Jews are not identified as Jews.

Line 252: European Immigration (Italians, Jewish, Polish, Irish, Serbian, etc.) Topics will include history and waves of European immigration to the United States, the role of World Wars I and II , the Cold War, Iron Curtain, and Communism played in immigration policies and effects on populations of immigrants"...
Line 807: "In this process, students will explore the relationships between previous generations and their modern generation by reading the chapter and writing a diary entry for each sub-section in the chapter (6 total: Japanese Americans, African Americans, Chinese Americans, Mexican Americans, Native Americans, Jewish Americans) from the perspective of a person of that group during that time period." If Jewish Americans are to be included as one of 6 major ethnicities in the U.S., then why is there no mention of Jewish Americans as an actual ethnic group?
Line 1373: "Teacher discusses difference between invisible and visible identity. https://www.facinghistory.org/for-educators/educator-resources/readings/bear-wasnt https://www.facinghistory.org/for-educators/educator-resources/resources/facing-history-andourselves- holocaust-and-human-behavior"... In which specific ways is the Holocaust stated as a type of human behavior? Which human behavior does it exemplify?
Line 4047: "After Pearl Harbor, the unit moves into the ways the US transitioned into a war time economy and a state of total war as well as the civil rights issues that arose out of that (including the role of women in the war effort, Executive Order 9066 and Korematsu v. U.S., general divisions among African Americans about serving and other issues of tension created by the Second Great Migration, the Zoot Suit Riots, anti-Semitism and the limited response to the Holocaust, etc). Specific attention is paid to comparing and contrasting"... This is one of only two mentions of the Holocaust in the entire curriculum, and even here, it is followed by an "etc." Was there any other specific ethnicity that endured such discrimination, and in so great a number-- 6,000,000--as were the Jewish people of Europe during that war? And, there is no mention of Jews qua Jews.
