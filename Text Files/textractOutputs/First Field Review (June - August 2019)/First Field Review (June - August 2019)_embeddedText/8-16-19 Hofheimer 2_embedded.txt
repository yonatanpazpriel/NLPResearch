Ms. Soomin Chao Chair, Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
To Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
I write to share my concerns about the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
As written, the current draft omits the American Jewish experience, antisemitism and historic antisemitic violence. Such absences will marginalize hundreds of thousands of Jewish students in California and limit student understanding of the diversity of people that live in the state. It is especially disconcerting to see these omissions at a time of rising antisemitism both globally and in California.
Together with the ADL, the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, survivors of the Holocaust, and victims of multiple forms of identity-based hate violence, I urge you to remedy the anti-Jewish bias from the state's model curriculum. I am attaching to this letter an addendum listing specific areas of concern in the curriculum for your review.
I strongly support the study of California's diverse history, but the statewide model must be revised so it is fulsomely inclusive of the life, culture and contributions of all.
Respectfully,
Lisa Hofheimer
