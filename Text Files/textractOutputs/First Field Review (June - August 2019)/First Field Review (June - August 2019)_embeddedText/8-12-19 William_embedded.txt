As a licensed high school English teacher, I am writing to object to the mandatory nature of the Ethnic Studies Bill AB 331, as well as the important fact that it slights the experiences--both in the past and, unfortunately, also in the present-- of Jewish people. As the Calif. Legislative Jewish Caucus wrote, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community." I also refer you to today's Op Ed by Dan Walters, "State's ethnic studies political time bomb explodes." I do think there is value in many parts of the curriculum (which I read, by the way), but there was no mention that I could find of the fine work done, for example, by the exemplary program "Facing History and Ourselves," used very successfully by many high school districts in the country. I hope the bill will be re-examined and amended before it is too late!
Sincerely, Judith William
