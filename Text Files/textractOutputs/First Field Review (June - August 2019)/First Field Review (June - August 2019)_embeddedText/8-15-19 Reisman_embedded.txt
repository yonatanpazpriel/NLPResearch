From: Cary Reisman Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 3:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model Curriculum on Ethnic Studies
I understand that you are in the process of developing a model curriculum on ethnic studies, including a that Arab American students study Israel/Palestine issues and the BDS movement. I also understand that thus far you have refrained from including Jewish people and ant-Semitism as well as many other ethnic minorities that make up a substantial portion of California's residents. Including the BDS movement in a high school curriculum on ethnic studies is irresponsible at best. Including that while failing to include anti-Semitism is an affront to the Jewish community. Please remedy this injustice before finalizing the curriculum. Thank you very much. Cary S. Reisman Attorney At Law Wallin, Kress, Reisman & Kranitz, LLP
