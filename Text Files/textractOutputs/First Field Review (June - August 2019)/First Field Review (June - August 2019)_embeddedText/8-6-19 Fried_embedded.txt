From: LOUIS FRIED Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 3:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Kutik Julia Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As the child of Jewish immigrants I believe that the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum fails to address the immigration of Jews (as a minority group) to the United States and that Jews should be included in the curriculum.
Further believe that specific sections of the proposed curriculum lend themselves to prejudicial characterization of Jews through equating the political reality of Israel with anti-Semitism. The document specifically equates Israel with Palestine on Page 237:
"1 To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as "Arab," (e.g. predominantly Arabic-speaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)"
Inappropriately compares the minority Arab immigration to the large Latino influx of 200+ years of standing.
"Students will link Arab immigration to immigration in other communities, particularly Latinos."
And finally, the document gives implicit recognition to the BDS movement on Page such as on Page 35 and Page 2 of the Glossary.
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.
Such a definition and the credibility it gives is contrary to the Federal Export Control Reform Act of 2018, which

"Title II ï¿½ Anti-boycott Provisions. This title incorporates the existing anti-boycott provisions from the expired Export Administration Act of 1979. These provisions discourage, and in some circumstances, prohibit U.S. companies from furthering or supporting the boycott of Israel sponsored by the Arab League, or certain other countries, including complying with certain requests for information designed to verify compliance with the boycott. "
Sincerely,
