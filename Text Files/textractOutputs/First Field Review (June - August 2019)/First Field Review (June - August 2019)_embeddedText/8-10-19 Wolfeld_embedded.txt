Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As a California parent and grandparent, I am very concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I strongly support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, as broad exposure to information about ethnic groups and histories other than one's own is the best way to promote understanding and tolerance.
This curriculum, however does not do that. It contains one-sided disinformation and promotes vitriol instead. How ironic, that a curriculum whose purpose is to spread acceptance and open-mindedness is filled instead with anti-Jewish and anti-Israeli bias. For example, the ESMC omits any mention of antisemitism though there are three times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims. The most recent FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. Hate crimes against Jews rose by 37% according to 2018 FBI statistics, accounting for over half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States. Though a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to antiSemitism.
I urge you to make major revisions or a substantial rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Thank you, Jeff Wolfeld
