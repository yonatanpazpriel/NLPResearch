Ethnic studies are most welcome as a mean to foster tolerance and promote a more equal and diverse society, one that values rights for everyone. With that in mind, the curriculum of any such program must be highly committed to be fully balanced, recognizing all ethnicities and definitely driving a message of inclusion. The state of California is home to 1.2 million Jews and 300,000 IsraeliAmericans, who are completely omitted from this program. This happens while anti-Semitism in on a steep rise all around the US and California, turning into serious violence. Poway synagogue shooting last April followed Pittsburg synagogue shooting killing 11 victims, and lately there was a suspect arrested in Oakland for planning mass murder of Jews. How can a modern program about ethnic studies simply omit the Jewish community as an ethnic group and ignore anti-Semitism?

There is a lot to be taught about the Arab American community, outside of the Arab-Israeli conflict that is far outside the context of ethnic groups. However, the program does address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and unfortunately takes a political side. Showing one group of people as an "oppressor" and the other one as "oppressed" has nothing to do with ethnic studies, rather simply a biased political opinion. In reality, the nature of this conflict like any other one is far more complex, and again, not an ethnic material, rather a political one. Moreover, promoting BDS as a legitimate movement is outrageous. The idea of BDS movement included in the context of ethnic groups within the US proves an anti-Semitic agenda as BDS is a political movement against Israel and has nothing to do with American ethnic groups. Linking BDS to Black Lives Matter and #MeToo is hiding its true objective as declared by the group itself. Classic anti-Semitic narrative is brought in the lesson about "Hip Hop as Resistance" in one of the songs for instance: "for every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded" and Israel supporters "use the press so they can manufacture."

Another song included "The real Arab Money", including lyrics such as: "In Palestine, kids can't shop at these malls... My nation on my back, look how proud we are. ... America bustin' nuts on Saudi Riyals"

Or from another one: "Get out Yankees from Latin America, French, English and Dutch, I love you Free Palestine."

The linkage of "Yankees" and "America" to "Palestine" is a clever way to connect Jews and Israel to drive America to take actions against Palestinians. This is a narrative of hatred, not love, not inclusion. It's not about ethnic education, it's about politics and a very ugly one!
