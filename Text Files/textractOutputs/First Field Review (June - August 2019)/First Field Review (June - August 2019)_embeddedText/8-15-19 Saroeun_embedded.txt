I am an administrator at a diverse school in Richmond. I am also a student who has personally been impacted by Ethnic Studies. I initially majored in Sociology and double majored in Ethnic Studies when I realized that the field of Sociology still fell short of showing the vibrant and unique ways of being that exist in many societies of color. Although there is no complete anthology that can encompass all the first nations and diasporic identities that exist in this country, no ethnic studies curriculum would be complete without also including the legacies of Arab and Arab Americans. This is why I support the objectives listed in chapter 2, on page 233, lines 4921 � 4931, which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
