From: Fritzi Goldberg Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject:
I am writing this in objection to the ethnic studies classes proposed for all CA public schools. Inasmuch as most of the education administration is white America - who will be able to make the segment about Islam, or Israel, or any religion or ethnicity. What does that white American administrator know about these other ethnicities that would enable them to create a curriculum that would represent all equally?
I think that this is a terrible idea,that will put concepts into the young that are not necessarily valid.
Please reconsider the creation of this curriculum.
Thank you
