I have deep reservations about the definition of BDS (Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions) movement that is listed in the Glossary, under B, starting at line 30.
You must alter this definition and provide one that is neutral, nuanced and politically unbiased. Otherwise this section and the education guidelines will be used to unfairly impose a particular viewpoint, whereas your aim is to educate young people and illustrate the complexity of issues.
I suggest the following definition
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that aims to apply international political cultural and economic pressure on Israel. Its proponents claim its aim is to establish freedom for Palestinians living under what they consider apartheid conditions. They call for (B) boycotting Israeli universities, companies and government agencies, (D) divesting from Israel and its companies and (S) sanctioning Israeli trade and political agreements. The BDS movement is dedicated to ending Israel's "occupation and colonization of all Arab lands" It's other stated goals include allowing Palestinian refugees from the 1948 War of Independence (and their descendants) to return to their former homes in Israel. Many Jewish and Israeli leaders and those who oppose the BDS movement see the effort as a discriminatory attempt to undermine Israel's legitimacy as a Jewish state.
