From: kailee graham Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 2:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Curriculum
California Department of Education (CDE)
Instructional Quality Commission (IQC)
and State Board of Education
Dear CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education, I strongly urge you to REMOVE antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely,
Kailee Graham
