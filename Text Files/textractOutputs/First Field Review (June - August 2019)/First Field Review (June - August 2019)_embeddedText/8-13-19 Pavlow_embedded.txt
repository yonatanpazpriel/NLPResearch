As a 68 year old grandmother, I'm very concerned with the world my grandchildren will be left with. The only way to truly present an ethnic study is to present ALL history. All of mankind has been oppressed, and power held in the hands of a very few will always oppress others. If you read your history, it will be obvious. And as the saying goes, "those who forget history are doomed to repeat it." That is what currently scares me the most. It starts out innocuous enough, omitting a history here or a history there, rewriting it, pretending it didn't happen, tearing down monuments. ALL history matters. To teach a onesided history is an affront to all who lived through it. To be inclusive means all. Teach the history of the world and teach critical thinking. Force the students to see all sides. More important, if they are taught how to reason for themselves, how to research themselves, we will all be better off. Students don't need to be spoon fed by those seeking a specific result.
