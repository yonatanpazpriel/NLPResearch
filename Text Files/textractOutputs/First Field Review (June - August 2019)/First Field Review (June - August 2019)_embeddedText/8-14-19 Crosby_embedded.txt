After looking over the materials, as an educator I find this curriculum inappropriate in that it has too much of a political slant, telling students how to think rather than have an open discussion. Also, there is no mention of anti-Semitism which has spiked in recent years, including the incident in Poway. Hatred towards Jewish people who have much smaller numbers in California than other minority groups, is a major oversight by those putting the curriculum together. If such an Ethnic Studies course is mandated for every student in the state, they ALL groups which have hate crimes need to be included. Associating capitalism with oppression is more opinion than fact and should not be taught that way. Public schools should enforce objectivity in their lessons not slant facts towards certain people's opinions.
