In general, the document reads like a stereotypical groupthink and propaganda. In the intro, students can organize for voting rights for undocumented immigrants ... when even pro-immigrant people such as I might question allowing noncitizens to vote. Capitalism is denigrated throughout without mentioning how people did pre-capitalism. Maybe, as I believe any fair study would indicate, capitalism has been a huge improvement to lives around the world.
Per capita (not absolute numbers), Jews experience more ethno prejudice and violent attacks than any other group. I've experienced both and my kids have in college, but anti-Semitism is not even mentioned in the intro-overviewesmc that details all kinds of other prejudice. In the 300 pages of samplecoursemodelsesmc, anti-Semitism is mentioned as an aside only once. This is blatantly biased and not reflective of real numbers or real experience. I get it, many Jews are successful and powerful, but so are many Arabs. Many Jews are also poor as are many Arabs.

Page 2, line 29+: This reads like a propaganda pamphlet. Here's the simple replacement: Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) aims to turn Israel into a pariah state. (direct quote from the founder https://mondoweiss.net/2015/07/movement-interview-

Page 234, lines: The border wall with Mexico and in Israel have nothing to do with each other. In one, economic migrants are trying to better their lives; In the other, infiltration is often done with the intention of often mass murder. A friend of mine who quite literally wouldn't/couldn't hurt a fly was murdered in such an attack protecting some women and children. Yes, it's very human and nothing special to build a wall for defense, your own house is partly such. Instead, one could compare how Shiites are treated in Saudi Arabia with how Arabs are treated in the US. That is a much more appropriate analogy.

Page 242, lines 5158: The Nakba was a failure to ethnically cleanse or commit genocide against the Jews as happened wherever the war against the UN sanction state was successful. The Jewish section of old Jerusalem was destroyed for example. The Arab section stands to this day. But, leaving this aside, and given the fact that as a percentage of prior-population far more Jews fled Arab lands to the US than Arabs fled their own governments to the US, why is there no section on the Jewish immigrant experience. My grandparents fled pogroms and genocide to come here. They were barely let in and were desperately poor and had to change their names to get jobs. They eventually founded businesses and their children contributed in major ways to flight safety, the moon program, electronic communication even as the members of their family who were not allowed to emigrate were all murdered.

This story, unlike the others that relentlessly portray the US as only a villain, gives more nuance. The US saved many, but also had prejudices.

Page 256: I get it, a somewhat obscure song is presented that claims Jews control the media ... I wonder why they often get such bad PR? Maybe we could look at the actual truth of who owns what and whether and how much that ownership equates to or is used for control?

I think it's fine to criticize Israel, but maybe it could be put in a real context? They are threatened by armies and terrorists on all sides. It is existential, because ethnic cleansing and genocide are endemic to the region. We just saw this in Iraq's ethnic cleansing of Sunnis and Sunnis genocidal response with ISIS. Maybe we can use the Armenians in Ottoman Turkey who were passively in the way of full Turk/Sunni control of the region and so were slaughtered with the treatment of the Palestinians in Israel who actively and often violently oppose the state and it's control? Is the modern case an actual genocide? How many Palestinians survive? What is the actual condition of Israeli Arabs vs Armenians now in Turkey? How about of Jews or Kurds in Shiite or Sunni lands? Use real, actual comparisons in context instead of ideological assertions.

Public Input Template�2019 Health Education Framework Page 5 of 6
Leaving out anti-Semitism is very hard to explain, so is the virtually total lack of focus on Jews as an ethnic group who arrived at different points in America's and California's history and making major contributions especially in California from Jeans to music to movies to the internet age. It is a gaping hole, so I looked over the committee and can't be sure, but I think there aren't any Jews on it despite being over 6% of California population.
More generally, this ethnic studies program seems very slanted to making assertions to create a narrative against capitalism, Whites, Jews or perhaps the perceived power structure in general. I'd be more interested in a program that actually tried to get at some objective truth: learn about different ethnic histories but put them into some kind of context. How were Chinese immigrants treated in California compared with, say Malaysia? How are Shiites treated in Saudi Arabia or Egypt compared to California? How was the experience of Jews, Chinese and Indians the same and different? How much of that experience is because of human nature (exclusion of others) vs cultural?
What good and bad came of capitalism? Look statistically. How have societies attempted to deal with the bad vs overthrowing the whole systems. How did the various strategies work out? Why have some hated groups such as Chinese done seemingly better than others? How do other hated groups such as Koreans in Japan, Kurds and Shiites in Sunni areas fare? Compare problems Arabs face in America vs Uighur's in China vs Christians in West Africa? What is the same and different between Kurds inside and outside of Turkey vs Palestinians inside and outside of Israel? How do societies deal the "outsiders" and why? How do societies treat threatening groups (Japanese, Arabs in America vs Palestinians and Israeli Arabs in Israel vs Christians in Palestine vs Shiites in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Kurds in Turkey)? What part of this is human nature, what part is culture, what part is "Western"?
It would be good if students came out actually understanding the US in context of "normal" human cultures, societies and ethnocentric mixes. It did horrible things like the slave trade. How did slavery differ here than in other

contemporary and ancient societies? Overt slavery still exists in places such as Muslim Mauritania. What forces led to slavery's end here vs. in other societies? Why does it persist to this day?? How did freed slaves fare in this vs other societies? The American natives suffered greatly after contact with Europe by taking land, disease and war. Compare this to other examples of contact between different cultures and technologies in history (Mongolian conquests, Han Chinese sweep of China, Native Taiwanese vs Mainland invasion with Chiang Kai Shek, Romans in England and Spain). The US exists in the context of humanity, what really happened worse? What happened better? Compare this to other ethnically mixed societies and their experience? What part is due to Western culture, what to human nature?

Rather than push a narrative, there is some possible objective truth here, but it can only be seen by comparison ... and certainly not by ignoring a key ethnic group.
