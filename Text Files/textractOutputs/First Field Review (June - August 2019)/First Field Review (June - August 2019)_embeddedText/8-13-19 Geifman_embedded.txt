[As a member of the Jewish faith and an active member of a synagogue here in California, I want
you to know of my deep concern with this current draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The committee who stated they want to be inclusive and help our students under our state's ethnic history and rich diversity. However, I cannot understand or support this current draft as it is written. There is no mention of the Jewish American experience. It fails to include anti-Semitism that has raised its ugly head once again, singles out criticism of Israel and reinforces anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.
This draft erases significant contributions of the California Jews to our history, culture, government, scientific and technological development. The American Jewish experience in this curriculum draft erases that. There are many courses in school syllabuses for African Americans, Native American students, Latin Americans, and Arab American courses. I never see courses on the Jewish experience in California or mention of the Holocaust, which has been the most traumatic experience for Jews in America, Israel, and all over the world.
Quote- Ben Allen, representative from Southern California says: "Part of living in a diverse, multicultural society is having awareness and sensitivity to other people's beliefs".
Is there a bias in this committee? Is there an anti-Semitic bias in this committee?
