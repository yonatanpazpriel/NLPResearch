We are greatly concerned about the potential ethnic studies curriculum currently under review by the State of California. The purpose of the proposed ethnic studies curriculum is worthy--to promote understanding and tolerance in our state school system, given the diversity of ethnic groups and cultures in California. Unfortunately, we believe that the proposed program is itself biased and bigoted - it is filled with vile anti-Semitism and is unabashedly anti-Israel. We remind you that Israel is the only true democracy in the Middle East and it is the only country in that region that supports women and LGTBQ rights.

Sadly, this educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities marginalizes Jews, omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry, and strongly promotes the boycott, divestment, and sanctions ("BDS") movement against Israel while doing nothing to contextualize the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Virtually every Jewish organization, from the ADL to the JCRC to the Federation and even the Jewish caucus of California legislators have expressed their concerns.

Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum:

1. The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

2. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:
� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).

� Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

� Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).

� Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).

� Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

3. A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the BDS Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" without any critical perspective, including that a stated goal of many of the founders and promoters of the movement is actually to end the existence of the State of Israel.

We and our family respectfully request that you review this and take the stops necessary to oppose the adoption of this program without first eliminating the anti-Semitism and anti-Israel portions which infect it. Thank you.
