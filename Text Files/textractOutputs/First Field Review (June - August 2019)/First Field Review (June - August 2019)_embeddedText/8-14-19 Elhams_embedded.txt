Pages 233 to 287 are heartening and complete. It is crucial for California to fully include all the parts that relate to Arab Americans and Muslims, because our history is rich, contributes to the understanding of the American texture and history, and importantly tells an accurate, rich and non-stereotyped story about the Arab American experience. Although most Arabs are Muslims this section addresses non-Muslim Arabs who are christens and play an important roll in the Arab and Muslim world. Without this kind of comprehensive curriculum, Arab Americans become second class citizens. Arab Americans, of various faith background, must be visible, front and center like other groups in California and the nation. If our story is not treated accurately and equally, not only is not fair, but given anti-Arab and anti-Muslim expressions, we become invisible, less safe, and more vulnerable to bullying, discrimination and other harmful circumstances.

Page 35: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions- BDS educates the public and insures a peaceful expressions to counter the skewed reportage and views from the media. At its core, BDS is inspired by a peaceful agenda initiated from Palestinian civil society with peace and harmony as its end. It is also fiscally tough. For many years Israeli policies amount to a severe boycott, divestment, sanctions and imprisonment of the Palestinian people under occupation. It dwarfs the BDS movement. Palestinians are not permitted to easily leave or easily enter the territories for employment, travel, family weddings, births and funerals, Israel is remiss in paying millions of dollars owed to Palestinians in tariffs, and other funding not permitted to residents

Palestinian and Israeli life, and particularly how it affects their basic rights to food, life, property, safety, and freedom.
Although we hear a great deal about Israeli `security' concerns, Israeli daily life is far less impacted by this conflict than that of Palestinians. The basic power dynamic is responsible for the vastly different experiences of these two populations. Israel, with the fourth strongest military in the world, and empowered by US support, has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip (or `Palestinian Territories') since 1967. The Palestinians have no military, few weapons, and no powerful allies.
Israel's occupation controls almost all aspects of Palestinian life. Children have difficult getting to school, parents to work, the sick and injured to hospitals, because Israel has erected hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks obstructing Palestinian movement around their own country.
In addition to the daily difficulty posed by roadblocks, Israel has the ability � which it uses with disturbing frequency � to completely shut down parts or all of the West Bank and Gaza. Sometimes Israel imposes, by force of arms, a `curfew' for an entire city or village. Heavily-armed Israeli troops enter civilian cities in tanks and armored vehicles, to prevent all inhabitants from leaving their houses for weeks or months at a time (only broken up by occasional hourlong respites, to allow residents to obtain food).

In 2002, Israel began constructing a barrier through the Palestinian West Bank, confiscating huge tracts of land, demolishing many homes and crops, cutting off many Palestinians from their means of survival, and making travel even more difficult for the entire population.
Every so often Israel `re-invades', a section of the West Bank or Gaza strip, wreaking havoc above and beyond the `normal' obstructions to movement described above. In the course of these invasions, much of the infrastructure for a future Palestinian state has been destroyed, many people have been killed, and much personal property � cars, homes, etc. � has been stolen or obliterated.
All of these policies are the result of the underlying ideology of Israel: Zionism. Palestinians, whether citizens of Israel or subjects of the occupation, face policies of discrimination at every level of Israeli beaurocracy.
of the West Bank and Gaza. BDS is a peaceful movement that points out these disparities. Otherwise, Israel has no motivation for a peaceful resolution. As an Arab American of Lebanese nad Palestinian descent I have been told for decades by Israeli supporters that Palestinians must bring about peaceful means to their ends; restoring human rights, ending

In actuality, Israel boycotts the Palestinians. Israel's occupation controls almost all aspects of Palestinian life. Children have difficulty getting to school, parents to work, the sick and injured to hospitals, because Israel has erected hundreds of checkpoints and roadblocks obstructing Palestinian movement around their own country.

Oppression of Women is more of cultural habits and has nothing to do with Islam. On the contrary, Islam gave women more rights (inheritance and business ownership, education, right to divorce, etc.) and freedoms than any other faith.

Various pages and lines: Discussions about the rise of Islamophobia are heartening. Thank you. I complement you on the various sections in the document where you clarify the negative sentiments toward Arabs, non-Arab Muslims and Islam.
