Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] Reference to pages: 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269 For the sake of my grandchildren and others and to prevent bigotry from being taught in schools, I urge you to eliminate any reference to BDS, a movement and ideology which targets for condemnation only one country in the world and only the Jewish people. BDS is not concerned about promoting diversity and tolerance, rather it fans unjustified animosity toward one country and one people. If retained in the curriculum, California schools will be guilty of advocating intolerance rather than combating it.
