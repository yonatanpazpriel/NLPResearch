Dear Ms. Chao,
Referencing the proposed ethnic-studies curriculum by the California Department of Education, I call for the Department to establish safeguards to prevent attempts to use educational curricula to indoctrinate students with biased agenda. The proposed curriculum section on "Arab American Studies Course Outline" contains a number of passages concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such as "Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter," "Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel" and "Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico." It also includes studying national figures such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), Rep. Rashida Tlaib (DMich.), the late Columbia University professor Edward Said, Women's March leader Linda Sarsour, the late radio personality Casey Kasem, actress Alia Shawkat and the late White House correspondent Helen Thomas--all of whom are associated with antiSemitic and anti-Israel rhetoric, and in the case of the congresswomen, a push to enact legislation punishing Israel.
Studies of anti-Semitic activity on college and university campuses across the country have consistently shown that schools with anti- Zionist expression and activity, including the promotion of BDS, are about three times more likely to host incidents targeting Jewish students for harm. The anti-Jewish, anti-Israel bias of the proposed curriculum embodies an implicit portrayal of Jews and Israel as part of interlocking systems of oppression and privilege. To retain this bias is inconsistent with the 2016 law calling for the creation of a model ethnic-studies curriculum.
Thank You Doron A. Dula, Psy.D. Claremont CA
