I am requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the Model Curriculum. BDS promotes hate and division. (Note section B of Glossary also, p.234).
I value inclusion and encourage the State of California to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
