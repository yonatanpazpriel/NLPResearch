In general, the guidelines are designed to indoctrinate students into particular points of view. With respect to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they adopt a completely one-sided perspective.
Further, they do not recognize anti-Semitism as a form of discrimination or Jews as a minority group that has faced discrimination. This document demonizes Jews who support Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state (which is almost all of us) and opens them to discrimination and harassment.

The Jewish community is a strong ally of anti-bias curriculum that protects Arabs and Muslims from discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion.

p.2 lines 30-40 defines BDS in a way that is completely one-sided. The definition leaves out the fact that BDS advocates such as Direct Action for Palestine, Jewish Voice for Peace and Students for Justice in Palestine deny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. In approving of BDS, the guidelines step far out of the overwhelming mainstream of progressive Jewish peace activists. BDS advocates deny the right of Israel to exist as a Jewish state. This fringe view is rejected by the Saudi Peace Initiative, the Palestinian National Council, and almost all genuine advocates for peace, Palestinian statehood, and an end to the occupation. Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).

Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
