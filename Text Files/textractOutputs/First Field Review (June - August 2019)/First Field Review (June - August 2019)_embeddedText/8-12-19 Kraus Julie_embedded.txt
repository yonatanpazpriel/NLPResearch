Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I write to you as an educator and the mother of three teenagers and out of extreme concern regarding the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Though I most certainly support the idea of offering an ethnic studies class, and see great value in doing so, I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As it stands, ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. How does this promote inclusion and tolerance? It is indefensible in the light of rising antisemitism in America to exclude Jews from an Ethnic Studies class for high school students. Not only does the curriculum denigrate Jews, it is completely one sided, regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
I request that you make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you for your time, Julie Kraus
