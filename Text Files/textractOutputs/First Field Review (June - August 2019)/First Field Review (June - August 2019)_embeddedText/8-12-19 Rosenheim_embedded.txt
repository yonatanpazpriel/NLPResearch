From: Jay A. Rosenheim Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 3:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comment on State Board of Education Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear State Board of Education:
I have just reviewed the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am saddened and, indeed, appalled at the way the experiences of Arab Americans are described, and how they are linked to extraordinarily negative and distorted representations of the United States and Israel, filled with criticism of both the United States' interactions with the Arab world and with Israeli actions in the protracfted Israeli-Arab conflict. To give the school children of California an ethnic studies curriculum with this content is not to educate them, by showing them the complexities of a difficult conflict. Rather it is to indoctrinate and propagandize impressionable young minds with a single, strident viewpoint. This is, in my opinion, the worst sort of action from an educational institution to undertake.
Why are some minorities singled out in this Ethnic Studies program as deserving of special protections and understanding, while others are held up instead only for criticism?
This curriculum needs to be completely overhauled if it is to be anything other than a political act of one group trying to impose their views on the public.
