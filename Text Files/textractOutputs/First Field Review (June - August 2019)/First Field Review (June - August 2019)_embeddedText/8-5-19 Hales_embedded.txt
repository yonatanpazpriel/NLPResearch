The entire document is a political indoctrination program posing as "education". It promotes hatred towards white people, western civilization and western values of individual rights and equality. It is full of hate speech, racism and sexism directed at Caucasians and males. The people who wrote and promote this program have no business in our school system and should be removed from any positions of trust and authority over children. It is clear that `Ethnic Studies" has been taken over by racists, bigots and anti-Western civilization radicals who seek to mal-educate and indoctrinate children in their hateful ideology in order to transform society into a mirror image of their hateful and bigoted views.
