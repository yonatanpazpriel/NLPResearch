To Chairwoman Chao and the Members of the Instructional Quality Commission
I am writing to you to express my concern regarding the proposed draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I have taken the time to read the draft curriculum and noticed some omissions and errors.
My key concerns are:
1. The draft curriculum omits any discussion of antisemitism and the discrimination and hate directed at Jewish Americans in the past and present, exemplified in the recent surge of violent antisemitic incidents.
2. The draft curriculum discusses the displacement of Palestinians without providing the context and facts associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It refers to "the Nakba" but never mentions the Holocaust or the need for a Jewish state, nor does it discuss the violence that preceded the Israeli War of Independence and continues to this day.
3. The draft curriculum condemns Israel and justifies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement which is widely perceived by the Jewish community as discrimination against Jews and Israelis. Instead, it considers the BDS movement a civil rights movement.
If this curriculum is intended to reduce bias and discrimination, it must tell all sides of each minority's story and provide all the facts surrounding their struggles. The story of the Jewish American experience in California should be included in this curriculum to debunk the same type of stereotypes and prejudice all the other minority groups face.
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to voice my concerns.
Sincerely,
Eve Notas
