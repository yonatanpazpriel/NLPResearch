Page 2. BDS Definition Line 30-40 This definition overtly suggests that the state of Israel participates in apartheid against "Palestinians" and violates International law, both of which are patently untrue. Such an entry virtually ENSURES a growth in antisemitism in classrooms, and is destructive to the psyche of all Jewish students. Page 234. Direct Action Front for Palestine Line 4956 This is an organization that promotes terrorism against innocent Israelis. There is no opposing perspective presented to the glorified positioning of this organization. Page 234. Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico Line 4958 Promotes a false equivalence between Israel trying to protect itself from terrorists attempting to enter the country and the illegal immigration issue at the US Border. Page 237. Israel-Palestine Line 5030 There is a country called Israel. There is NOT a country called Palestine, nor is there a country called Israel-Palestine. This is completely inaccurate language.

Page 241. Palestine/Israel Line 5138 There is a country called Israel. There is NOT a country called Palestine, nor is there a country called Palestine/Israel. This is completely inaccurate language. Page 242. Nakba Line 5157-5161 The actual history of the 1948 War of Independence for Israel is completely ignored in this perspective. Using the word Nakba to describe the dispersal is biased. This was primarily a voluntary migration encouraged by Arab Nations, with a promise of return from the Arab nations when they won the war. They lost, and those who left became refugees. This is not clearly explained here at all. Page 256, 264-269. Somos Sur Line 5484-5494 This song presents Israel as an aggressor and has many inaccurate statements in it. There is no content providing a counterpoint and correction of the lyrics, nor is there, in this curriculum, any criticism or responsibility assigned to "Palestinians".

Page 256 Soundtrack of Hegemony Line 5495 The assignment, "Soundtrack of Hegemony" suggests that Israel is responsible for hegemony, and does not accurately reflect the history and reasons for the "Palestinians" plight.

ENTIRE CURRICULUM The purpose of this curriculum is, in your words, to aid "in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." In an era when anti-Semitic hate crimes are at an all-time high, there is absolutely no discussion in this curriculum of the history of the Jewish Community, and the overall perspective of the "Palestinians" is presented without discussion of the true history of the land, the conflicts there, or "Palestinian" terrorism. Without a clear presentation of history, unbiased by current social efforts to change the narrative and actually invent history, this curriculum is inherently antiSemitic and untrue.
