While I am sending this comment to you because I was asked to do so via e-mail, I write to you because if this proposed course is not 100% objective, without a biased point of view, and multicultural in nature, it has no place in public schools. Having been and continuing to be an educator my entire adult life (from public schools, to law schools, to doctoral students in a Clinical Forensic Psychology Program), I am aware of the need to teach diversity issues to all ages of students. However, politics, prejudice, and narrow perspective have no place in education-at any level. Please consider the following issues that have been raised and of which I've recently been made aware. If these are correct (or have any basis in fact) please reconsider:
1. The suggestions about BDS reflect the viewpoint of the Arab side in the current Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and contain outrageous falsehoods.
2. BDS is an effort to destroy the State of Israel by isolating it economically, culturally, and politically.
3. The State of California should not be teaching its young people one side only in an international conflict.
4. An ethnic studies program should be making our young people aware of antiSemitism, not teaching it.
Thank you for your attention. Best, Linda Gomberg, JD, PhD Associate Professor The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, Southern California
