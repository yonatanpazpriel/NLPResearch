From: Frederick Trapp Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed new curriculum- ethnic studies
To Whom It May Concern:
I am rather alarmed at the content of the proposed model curriculum that appears too biased and unbalanced. I do not think the curriculum really challenges students to read, listen, gather facts, analyze those facts, and think critically about ethnicity.
it is full of silly "politically correct" obtuse references.
We do not need a curriculum that is an exercise in group thinking, but instead we need balanced thinking about race, gender, and sexuality throughout history. The material is too one sided.
