From: Stein, Alan Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 5:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Recognizing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is seriously flawed is a step in the right direction, but simply attempting to revise it would be a fundamental error. The committee which put it together clearly had an agenda, including antisemitism but almost certainly including other bigotries, which conflicted with objectively carrying out its mandate. At least some of the instantiations of its bigotry will almost certainly slip through any revision.
A totally new committee must be formed, vetted so that its members will honestly try to follow its mandate. That committee should begin from scratch so it is free from even subconsciously including any of the bigotry permeating the first proposal.
Sincerely,
Alan Stein
