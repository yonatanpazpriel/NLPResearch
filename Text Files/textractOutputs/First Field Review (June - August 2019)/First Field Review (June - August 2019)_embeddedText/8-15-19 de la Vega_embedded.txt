In a nutshell: Tear it up, toss it out, thank the committee for their service and form a completely new one that is actually as diverse as California.
Even better: There's no need for this model as most current curricula in US history, sociology, world history, geography, literature, and the arts NOW DO include voices and individuals from the groups that ethnic studies promotes. Teachers should actually teach and provide students with a wide range of opportunities to learn about what America is all about. Therefore, there's no need to make this a graduation requirement at all.
The model indoctrinates, not educates. It creates a victim mentality. It proselytizes.... It practically forces all students to become "social justice warriors" (woe to the student who doesn't agree with the teacher and class's groupthink exercises!) And it is horribly anti-Semitic. Don't get me started on its views on capitalism... Educators are supposed to provide students with tools so they can think, research, write and speak critically about any subject or issue they come across: end of story.

By dividing individuals into convenient groups, this approach furthers "identity politics" instead of individual achievements, talents, and contributions. By only covering four groups, you leave others out completely. Giving the sense that they have no value or don't even exist.

Much of the content is so current (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is given in an example??!!) that the entire model errs by depriving students of a well-researched historical view its topic: "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."

PS: Please hold all the fancy way-out-there academic jargon like "hxstory": seriously, the etymology of the word "history" has nothing to do with men!
