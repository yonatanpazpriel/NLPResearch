Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
On page 1 you omit any definition of Anti-Semitism yet in the document you include other forms of discrimination to other groups of people, which, in and of itself is a form of discrimination. On page 234 you call for Boycott, Divestment, and Sanction of Israel. This is an outright demonstration of political bias and, combined with the politically biased language on page 242 (line 5157-61: using politically biased language to refer to the founding of Israel; and line 5802-03: using Anti-Semitic tropes of Jewish people controlling the media) is another demonstration of Anti-Semitism in your proposed document.
