From: Doug Morrison Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This curriculum is indoctrination. It's goal is nothing less than pushing leftist views on impressionable young minds. Also, it is anti-Semitic. Shame on the California State Education System for even considering this material. Regards, Douglas Morrison, Oceanside Ca., registered voter.
