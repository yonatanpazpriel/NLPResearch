From: Roxanne Benjamin Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum Conern
To Whom It May Concern,
As a parent of two young children in Los Angeles, I have some concerns with the proposed ethnic studies curriculum being proposed. I read through much of the proposed curriculum and I understand that this is a "guideline" that can be modified by different teachers to address specific ethnicities in their schools unique population. However, I strongly feel that if the topic of Arab Americans as a minority group being addressed is part of the recommended curriculum, given the political climate we live in, with a very real and heated, ongoing conflict between Jews and Palestinians and other Arab groups in the Middle East, that there should be an equal emphasis or recommendation to address Jews as a minority group and the challenges that Jewish communities have faced. As a Persian Jew, I am both Jewish and middle eastern. I consider myself fairly liberal, having grown up with many close friends of a wide array of ethnicities and religions, and do believe that addressing the prejudices that Arab Americans face is extremely important. However, just as such, I believe it is extremely important to address the same types of prejudices, stereotypes, and the increasingly more frequent anti-Semitic acts that we have recently seen, as part of the ethnic studies being proposed.
I hope that the committee is able to make adjustments that will more appropriately and holistically address the multitude of diverse ethnic communities across California.
Sincerely, Roxanne Benjamin
