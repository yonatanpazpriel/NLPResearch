From: Stanley Fischman Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 6:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies ; Tony Thurmond schao Subject: Curriculum revision
Dear Educators, We are writing to express our great distress and disappointment at the decision to create a revised program of study that unfairly and inapppropriately attacks the State of Israel. This wanton discrimination and bias sends a distorted and chilling message to the students of California and the nation. We implore you to reconsider and direct your energies to a fair and balanced curriculum. We appreciate your consideration to this matter. Sincerely, Stanley & Florence Fischman New Milford, NJ Two retired school principals
