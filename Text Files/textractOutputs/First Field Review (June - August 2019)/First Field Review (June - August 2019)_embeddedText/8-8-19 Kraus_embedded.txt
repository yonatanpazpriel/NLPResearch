As a member of the Jewish community in California and an attorney, I am deeply disturbed by the model curriculum currently being reviewed by The State of California, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel, omits teaching about Jewish Americans as a cultural minority in this country, and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am appalled that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. The very purpose of ethnic studies is to achieve tolerance and understanding through education. This portion of the Arab American program related to the Jewish Community and Israel does exactly the opposite and is historically and culturally inaccurate continuing stereotypes that are Anti-Semitic.
`The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism.'
Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. The goals also discuss creating community in the classroom, yet the curriculum teaches hostility to the Jewish community. Hostility towards Jewish students has played out on some of our college campuses like San Francisco State University.
Glossary � includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. The founders of BDS advocate the destruction of Israel.
In addition, you are advocating an educational plan and using the word "apartheid" is factually and historically inaccurate. The west bank is a separate land that is not part of the state of Israel but Israel took over administration of the West Bank from Jordan after the 6 day war in 1967. The Palestinians of the West Bank were never citizens of Israel. Additionally, the land was divided by the United Nations Assembly in 1947.
Sample Lesson Plans Page 234 and 235 � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action Front for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. That group is put on the same line as Black Lives Matter which has nothing to do with the IsraelPalestinian issues. In addition, highlighting individuals such as Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tiab, Ilhan Omar and Helen Thomas who are Anti-Semites, have all made Anti-Semitic comments and advocate the destruction of the State of Israel, without context, a true

historical factual discussion of the founding of the State of Israel, or discussion of AntiSemitism is misleading and teaches hate not tolerance. Page 234 � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 256, 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is upsetting. Why is there not a section on Jewish Americans. We are a small minority. As a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division. and allowing factual and historical inaccuracies to be taught as fact,
