This proposed model curriculum for Ethnic Studies is unfortunately not conducive to learning critical thinking skills nor to developing a cooperative, open learning environment.
As the Introduction and Overview section demonstrates, the curriculum is ideologically driven rather than educationally driven. The persistent use of spellings and references found within critical theory stamp the curriculum with a distinct position in worldview. There is no place for this type of pointed ideology in any course that seeks to encourage cooperative and critical thinking.
Critical thinking requires the ability to assess divergent opinions and arguments while formulating an opinion on any subject. Just reading the Guiding Principles and Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching (page 11-12) one is struck by the very clear antipathy toward traditional American beliefs such as individualism, personal responsibility, freedom of speech, economic freedom and determinism through capitalism and cooperative, unified communities. The current political ideas of monetary reparation for historic (yes, historic because I know how to spell) wrongs and demonization of (white) colonialism, (white) empire and (white) imperialism are obviously to be understood through only the lens of critical theory, the oppressor versus the oppressed. Any white student is clearly not part of the student "well-being" being promoted here. Yet they will be required to take part in ethnic studies. Any opinions they voice that might counter the ideology underlying this curriculum will be unwelcome and labeled as racist, promoting white supremacy, homophobic, patriarchal and other usual labels thrown out by adherents of progressive political thought. This small section invites such a response by virtue of its definite ideological view signaled by terminology and subject matter.
The highjacking of language by the ideologues who have written this proposed curriculum creates a jarring reading experience. Frankly, it's language that most everyday people do not understand or believe is necessary. "Cisheteropatriarchy" is the most ridiculous example of such flagrant virtue signaling words that are encountered throughout the document. "Hxstory" is a

ludicrous use of language that seeks to keep everyone feeling happy and unoffended. The reality of life is that no one in a student's future workplace is going to be that considerate. These issues are distractions from real educational goals. They need to stop.
In conclusion, California is one of the lowest ranking states in education because of the obsession with style over substance. The progressive obsession with social justice and critical theory has resulted in legislation and guidelines that undermine effective education for the sake of ideological indoctrination. I don't expect you to agree with me or even pay much attention to what I've said here. However, it is my right to say it. It is also my right as a voter and US citizen from California to request that you revisit this proposed curriculum and consider eliminating the elitist, academic words that make the document difficult to read. I also ask that you introduce clear instances of utilization of different political and ideological views in order to increase the opportunities for students to build critical thinking skills and work through unfamiliar or uncomfortable ideas.
Thank you.
