The Draft Curriculum unfairly presents a biased and one sided portrayal of the founding of the State of Israel and the Israeli-Palestine issue. It favorably references the BDS movement, which the United States House of Representatives recently opposed by a vote of 398-17. Indeed, the Glossary devotes more space to an explanation of BDS than to any other single term.
The Draft Curriculum unfairly ignores the Jewish immigration and assimilation experience and the history and recent rise of anti-Semitism. While Jewish Americans are far from the only minority group to face discrimination, their experience also cannot be written off. The fact that many Jews have overcome discrimination to succeed economically cannot justify ignoring either their history or their present day experience. Indeed, that history should be discussed and recognized.

The Draft Curriculum unfairly ignores the recent rise of anti-Semitism. The California Attorney General's Office reports that the number of hate crimes against Jews in California increased more than those against any other group in 2018, and a mass shooting occurred in a synagogue in Poway in April 2019. Anti-Semites marched in Charlottesville. Not only is there no discussion of antiSemitism, the term does not even appear in the Glossary.
