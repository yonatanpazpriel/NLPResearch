From: Susan Franklin Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:52 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Fwd: Do not implement your ridiculous curriculum for 2019
To whom it may concern :
Your planned curriculum for the school year 2019/2020 is very disturbing, inappropriate, emotionally damaging, & based on blatant lies. Capitalism should NOT BE DEMONIZED. Capitalism has lifted more people from poverty to lead the lives they hoped for than ANY OTHER SYSTEM IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD! How can you put Socialism & push Socialism when there has NEVER BEEN A SUCCESSFUL RESULT FROM SOCIALISM EVER IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD!
Policies like this one are what is driving Californians away from radical crazy California to other states teaching children so they can learn & be educated with truth & our American ideals that are the envy of the world. Your proposed curriculum end game is to indoctrinate our children into your radical agenda. I hope you fail.
Sincerely, Susan Franklin
