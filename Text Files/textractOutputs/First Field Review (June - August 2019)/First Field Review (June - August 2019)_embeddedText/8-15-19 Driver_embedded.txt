From: Ann Driver Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 9:25 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Opposed to Ethnic Studies Curriculum Framework
I want to express my opposition to the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum Framework. I feel it will not meet the needs of either our country or our students.
Please cancel this program.
Sincerely,
Ann Driver
