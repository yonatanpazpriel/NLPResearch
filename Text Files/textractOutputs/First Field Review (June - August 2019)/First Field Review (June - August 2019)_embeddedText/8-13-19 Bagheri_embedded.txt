To whom it may concern,
When reading the California Ethnic Study curriculum I realized the agenda behind it. This is a communist manifesto! Myself and other parents are horrified by this and will pull our kids out of public school if this is pushed forward.
To call everything racist is actually race baiting. It's a divide and conquer tactic used by those Elites to keep We the People fighting while you guys push your agenda. Connecting capitalism as white supremacy & racism! Capitalism is what pulled us out of poverty!
This curriculum is confusing and will do the opposite of what it says. It will take away our children's identity! Putting everyone in a box and further segregating! This is not what the great Martin Luther King intended!
This is full of left-wing activist agenda. Any truly religious person is going to fight back. Myself and others are going to contact every church, Temple, and Mosque in California!!!
This needs to be pulled from the schools as well as the New Sex Ed! Otherwise you are going to see pushback like you've never seen it!!!
Sincerely, Shiva Bagheri
