Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The Jewish American experience needs to be included in this curriculum. The rise of white supremacy groups that target Jews and Jewish institutions make the need to include this material all the more pressing. It will also help to encourage religious tolerance for all groups. The relationship of capitalism to imperialism is complicated and debatable. Yet this curriculum treats it as a factual relationship. While unfettered capitalism has many problems, ethnic studies is not an economic course and treating the topic without a meaningful understanding of economics and alternative systems is not a well-rounded education. It needs a more detailed explication than an "ethnic studies" course will give it. It should be eliminated or taught with much more useful information provided.
