Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
With three children already a minority in their classrooms adding the additional burden of a flawed educational platform highlighting their further minority status cannot possibly be beneficial to them. and is not an environment I want them to be part of.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience in America. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance.
I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, David Morgenstern
