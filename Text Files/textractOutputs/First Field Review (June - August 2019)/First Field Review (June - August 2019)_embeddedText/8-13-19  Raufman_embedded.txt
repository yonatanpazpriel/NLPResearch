Regarding: Public Input Templateï¿½2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Attached please find my completed public input template on the above-referenced matter.
In summary, the draft curriculum fails to meet the goals of the ESMC authorizing statute, AB2016, specifically, to "prepare pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."
The proposed curriculum fails by disregarding the American Jewish experience as well as in its presentation of the state of Israel. The draft excludes Jews and their American history. It neglects anti-Semitism by definition or discussion. Hatred of Jews; antiSemitism leads hate crimes and incidents against religious groups in California (in our schools and communities) as well as across the nation. But the proposed curriculum includes rote anti-Semitic tropes and anti-Jewish stereotypes. This is no way to teach ethnic studies to our students. Remember, our students will hold our future in their hands. I am a Jewish American who never heard about the holocaust until I took History classes at UCLA and I was a history major! This must not be continued into the next century!
As AB 2016 sets out: "the state's educational standards should be guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness and universally high expectations." I urge you to meet this standard by including Jewish culture and history, teaching about anti-Semitism, and avoiding irrelevant and inflammatory polemics related to Israel. Please provide a rational multi-cultural approach to ethnic studies! Jewish studies is a curriculum at many of our universities and deserves to be include in a comprehensive curriculum for ethnic studies.
Very truly yours,
