Please find my comments on the ethnic studies proposal. I firmly believe will need to teach inclusion, but not a the expense of another group. Will these studies outline all of the atrocities that were done to California's native population? Or are these just another chance to create prejudice, especially to the Jewish Community. Respectfully submitted. Jeff E. Frankel
