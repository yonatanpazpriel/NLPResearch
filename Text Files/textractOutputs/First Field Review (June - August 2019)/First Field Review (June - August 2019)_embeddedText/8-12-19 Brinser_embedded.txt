Failure to include these terms is intellectually dishonest, renders the document factually incomplete, and ignores the history and purpose of Ethnic Studies in the USA.

Glossary, section C: Definition of Capitalism: "Everything is commodified" is simplistic and hyperbolic; "everything" is not a standard or defined term. The omission of any reference to class is frankly shocking in a definition of capitalism. It reads like a deliberate effort to exclude working-class white

people from consideration as an exploited group, and renders unclear the

term "disproportionately." It is also unclear why "Native people" are

distinguished from "people of color" in this definition as they are not

distinguished in the definition of "people of color."

Glossary, section R: Definition of Redlining: Inclusion of the parenthetical phrase "often Black people" is accurate but obscures the widespread use of redlining in California to exclude Asians and Hispanics.

General note on whiteness and race: It would improve the definitions of Whiteness and Race to explain that they change over time and the only thing that has remained stable about the definition of "White" is not being Black.

The omission in this curriculum of anti-semitism as a form of ethnic oppression suggests an anti-semitic bias which would render the curriculum specious.
