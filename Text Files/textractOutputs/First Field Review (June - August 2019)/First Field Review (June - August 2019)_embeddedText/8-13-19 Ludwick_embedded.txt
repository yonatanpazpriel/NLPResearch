From: Gloria Ludwick Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 6:22 PM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Template for Word Document on Ethics Curriculum Proposal
Mr. McDonald, I would very much like to comment on several areas of this proposal. I do not have a PC, only a MAC laptop. Therefore, I am unable to submit since I don't have access to Word. Also, I am a bit confused as to why this particular subject matter is even addressed for teaching within our CA school system.
Why isn't this considered more of a political issue in a foreign country and those who are not yet a country vs an ethics study? As a former teacher within San Bernardino County Schools system I am wondering why isn't our education more focus on advancing our students to "reach for the stars?" My personal opinion has been to help students succeed in whatever their strengths are to become as successful as they each desire. Education is the big key to achieving the American dream. This seems to be a more negative than positive for student activity. There should be discussions both pro and con on all issues of interest. Wouldn't you agree that there seems more negative issues brought up and given more time than those positive ways to honor both side?
Please let me know how I can submit my thoughts on this proposal without using a PC.
Respectfully, Gloria Ludwick
