i read a couple of pages of the draft guidance document. What an outrageous waste of students' time. The government should not be in the indoctrination business. God knows you have more pressing issues at hand than propagandizing children with intersectionalist drivel. Los Angeles is starting to look and smell like Calcutta -- how about you devote some time to sorting that out? If you insist on inserting yourselves into school cirriculums, why don't you try pushing critical thinking? That would be a new one.
