This is very sad for our state and even our country. Reading, writing and arithmetic are the most important things you can teach a child. American history is way more important. That is what has made this country so great. Not the skewed history that you are teaching now, but real American history.
I believe that ethnic studies should be taught internally by ethnic families. Our children need to dive into American culture and ethnic children will be better off as well if they learn how to succeed inner country and about things in the past that have made our country so great.
A country with no borders and no concrete philosophy is not a country at all. Everyone should be united to the same cause.
Sad, sad, sad.
