The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is very complicated and nuanced. Very few Americans understand the history and the different perspectives to this conflict. The Palestinian/Israeli issue has no place in an ethnic studies class in California K-12 education. It should be taught as part of a world history class with many perspectives by teachers that are knowledgeable on this subject. Why discuss other current governments administrations? If we're going to discuss foreign governments mistreating people or regional disputes over land why start with Israel? Why not teach about the million Muslims that China is currently holding in concentration camps? about the abuse of women throughout Middle East and Africa? LGBTQ people are persecuted in Russia and executed in many Muslim countries, should we include that in the curriculum? There are many other examples to focus on. But again, the Palestinian/Israeli political situation has no relevance to the ethnic problems that we are experiencing in California and in the United States. That needs to be the focus and not someone's political agenda regarding BDS and Palestinians.
Ethnic studies in this state and in this country needs to focus on the serious issues that we have here. We need to focus on white supremacy, race relations, anti-immigrant violence, Anti-semitism, the history of slavery and segregation, and racial profiling. These are all issues that are impacting our children. And the holocaust should be part of the curriculum. Every CA student should take a field trip to a holocaust museum so they can see what hate and intolerance look like in their most horrific form.
