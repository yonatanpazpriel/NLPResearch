From: Linda Waldroup Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed curriculum bias
> I am writing to voice my support for the views expressed to your committee by the Jewish Caucus of the California legislature. > > The ESMC ignores the Jewish experience in California. Jews have made significant contributions to the history, politics, culture, and government of California. Rising antisemitism, particularly on college campuses, should lead to a curriculum that promotes inclusion and tolerance. Your proposed curriculum omits anti-semitism,denigrates Jews and Israel, and supports the antisemitic Boycott Divest and Sanction (BDS) movement. It omits any meaningful discussion about Jews from the Middle East even though there are large populations of Jews of that origin living in California. Referring to the Israel War of Independence and the creation of Israel as the "Nakba" or "catastrophe" is another example of extreme bias in your proposed curriculum. > > I am a native Californian and Holocaust descendant whose grandparents were murdered in a Nazi concentration camp. I have been very alarmed by the rise of anti-semitism in our country and worldwide. I urge your committee to do a better job in its treatment of Jews and Jewish history in your proposed curriculum. > > Sincerely, > > Linda Waldroup > 2516 Saklan Indian > Walnut Creek
