From: Michael Lewis Sent: Saturday, August 3, 2019 12:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: My comments on the ethnic studies curriculum
Having read this and the commentary, it is clear that this is less curriculum and more political indoctrination. It is unacceptable in its current form and I have already sent my comments and thoughts to my state representatives. I will also be following up with a letter to the Governor. This will be opposed by all rational citizens of the state who favor true education over political agendas and jingoism.
Regards Michael Lewis
