I find the ESMC as currently drafted potentially harmful to me, as a Jew, to Jews, and to our wider society as a whole for failing to include Jews in a meaningful way. It neglects any discussion of anti-Semitism, and further, it incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes in its completely inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American ethnic groups.
