Wow, I have just briefly looked at the sample content and am appalled at the overall feeling of negativity it promotes. This is NOT helping bring people together unless your goal is simply to rally everyone against people of "no color". It is also emphasizing and promoting hatred towards law enforcement. The information is incredibly one sided.

engaging in civic action, community service and/or community education to
dismantle white supremacy and institutional racism.

Why isn't Ethnic Studies promoting the positive qualities and contributions of people of color?! Instead the focus is on demonizing very specific groups of people. This will instill anger and discontent in our communities. You are encouraging groups of people to feel justified as "victims" which does not help long term. Really? Why are you encouraging race politics? Overall, your content strongly indicates that "whites" are bad and the cause of most of the issues. Again is your focus to bring everyone together (except white people and law enforcement)?

There is so much "wrong" here it's just overwhelming. You will be creating a dissatisfied generation of students that feel "wronged" and feel that the ONLY reason they have not achieved what they want is because of other people's actions. This is not healthy for society. You are not helping people of color � in many ways this is holding them back! There should be a strong emphasis on ways to help their own communities � that's powerful, that builds self esteem. Instead of demonizing law enforcement, talk about what they can do to build better relationships. There is so much more power in acknowledging what changes "we" can make in ourselves instead of pointing fingers at anyone who has wronged us.
This country has made many mistakes in the past, but people have much more opportunity in this country than so many other countries. I guess that's why millions of people flock to this country every year. If it was truly as bad as your content represents, that wouldn't be the case.
This content saddens me greatly as a 2nd generation California. Instead of promoting wonderful , unique qualities and accomplishments of people of color, you've turned it into a political stunt fostering anger and discontent in our youth.
You should be including information how various races have faced challenges and how they have overcome and achieved success. That would be positive !!
You wonder why there is an increase in anxiety in our youth � partly because they are CONSTANTLY fed all this negative information about this country instead of making them proud of it. There is plenty to be proud of if you truly look at our history. You are doing a disservice to you young people � shame on you.
