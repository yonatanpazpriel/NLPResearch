I applaud California for again taking the lead in education by creating a blueprint for Ethnic Studies which allows for a broad approach to a multi-faceted complex issue. As an author, I've spent more than a decade researching and writing stories about my Czech Jewish father who became a refugee after the Nazi occupied his homeland, first fleeing to China and later Long Beach, CA before settling in Florida. His collection of 400 WWII letters by 78 writers, photos and vintage film, oral interviews and other primary sources allow for students to read and listen to the past and relate it to stories they are hearing every day in the news about displaced persons. I suggest that your program encourage educators to continue to use non-fiction literature, primary sources from the past and ensure they are tied to current day situations. In the sound bite world of today, attention is gained through resonance and relevance. Displacement is a topic which will grow in this world from not only ethnic persecution and nationalism but climate change migrants, and more.
