A general comment, I was educated through california public schools, graduated from San Jose High School, and graduated from UC Davis. We live in a time when people can look up facts to promote whatever view they want to take. What makes us special as a state and as a school system is our ability to ground our knowledge in history and facts. Understanding Apartheid in South Africa and Mandella's work in removing it is incredibly powerful. Immigrants are an amazing part of this country and should be celebrated. I would love to see a section covering some of the more famous Jewish immigrants including dozens of nobel winners. We learn about the United States history of slavery and about amazing people like Frederic Douglas whose book to this day reminds me of his powerful story and message. I still recall images of Chinese immigrants dynamiting railroads and risking their lives to connect this country. These are all powerful images which fill me with respect for so many other cultures and I am thankful for the contribution they have made.

Having my kids go into public school, I would be incredibly thankful for them to have a section covering the contributions of Jewish immigrants.

Regarding Israel specifically, the sections below seem more interested in talking about Israel politics rather than Arabs in America. There are frequent snippets

taken throughout the text (ie referring to Palestinians coming from Israel due to what is termed a catastrophe) which are one sided and would make an Israeli immigrant, or supporters of Israel, reading it feel the need to offer their point of view. I don't think that is what you're trying to accomplish, please have a read below and consider taking out political bias to Israel and if Israeli history and current events is a topic that should be discussed, offer two points of view for what is a sensitive and complex topic frequently used by many operating off of one side of the story. pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:

Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).

Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

Use unclear language that implies "IsraelPalestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).

Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).

Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
