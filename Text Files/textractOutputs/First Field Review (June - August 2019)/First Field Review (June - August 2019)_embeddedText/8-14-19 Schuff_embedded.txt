From: John Schuff Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 5:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Ethnic Studies Public Comment
Please see attached public comment form which I have completed. This is my second one because there is so much to say about so many things.
The curriculum has no place in our education system.
Would like to hear what the department has learned from the public and what action we might expect to see taken.
Thank you,

Page 7, Lines 161 � 166: Claims that "Western Culture" views gender as rigidly binary. Does "Western Culture" include Asian, Middle Eastern & Pacific Island people? I don't believe you'll find peoples in these groups embracing this nonsense of "a far richer tapestry" which has no basis in science. A blood test can determine gender regardless of appearance or wishing it weren't so. The rationale for this program ignores reality to create another "reality". It has no place in the education of minors who are susceptible to accepting as fact ideas that have no basis in fact, as this program demonstrates. Page 8, Lines 199 � 201: Hxrstory, herstory, are not words to be found in the English language and should not, therefore, be taught to students. Just reading the definitions found here is confusing for an adult. Children should only be taught words that can be found in ANY dictionary in ANY library. Would you teach principles in mathematics or chemistry which exist nowhere but in your curriculum? I think not.

Page 13, Lines 312 � 313: Race is defined by the Merriam-Webster dictionary thus: https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/race

a: a family, tribe, people, or nation belonging to the same stock b: a class or kind of people unified by shared interests, habits, or characteristics 3a: an actually or potentially interbreeding group within a species also : a taxonomic category (such as a subspecies) representing such a group b: BREED c: a category of humankind that shares certain distinctive physical traits
Nothing here about "a social construct created by European and American pseudo-scientists"
Do African, Middle Eastern, Asian & Pacific Island peoples view race as anything other than the definition found in Merriam-Webster's? I think not.

Page 15, Lines 366-372: Whiteness- a social construct that has served as the foundation for racialization in the United States. Whiteness is the antithesis of Blackness, and is commonly associated with those that identify as white. However, Whiteness is much more than a racial identity marker, it separates those that are privileged from those that are not. Whiteness can manifest as a social, economic, political, and cultural behavior and power. For example, the "standard" or cultural "norm" are often always based on whiteness and by extension white culture, norms, and values.

To use this thinking, one would say that such highly successful people of African-American ancestry as Sidney Poitier, Colin Powell, Clarence Thomas or Condolezza Rice are somehow guilty of exhibiting characteristics of "Whiteness". NONSENSE! Radical thinking probably helped along by folks who hate people who aren't their color. This can do nothing to aid in peaceful acceptance of the diverse ethnicities within our borders. "Blackness" seems to exclude those of non-African-American ancestry, such as Asian, Middle Eastern, etc.
