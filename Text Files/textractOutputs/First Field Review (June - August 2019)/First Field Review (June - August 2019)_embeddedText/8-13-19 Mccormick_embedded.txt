Honestly... seems like overkill.
Teachers are already overwhelmed with sooo many training and testing and mandated reporting that goes along with the actually teaching the subject matter at hand.
We already have s teacher shortage and the statistic has remainders relatively the same for decades...
Half of all new teachers will permanently leave the profession within five years.
