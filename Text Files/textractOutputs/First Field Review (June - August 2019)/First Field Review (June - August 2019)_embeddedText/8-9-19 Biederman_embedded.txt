From: Irving Biederman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:08 AM To: CFIRD; Ethnic Studies Cc: Irving Biederman Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
As a University Professor, a citizen of the U.S. and the State of California, and a person of Jewish ancestry, I am outraged by the abject antisemitism and anti-Israel indoctrination of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters. It is clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum. The gross and deliberate dishonesty of historical and contemporary fact reflected in the curriculum that could have only come about as consequence of the writers' politicization is a call to action to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other statesponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Irving Biederman, Ph.D.
Harold W. Dornsife Professor of Neuroscience Director, Image Understanding Laboratory Departments of Psychology, Computer Science, and the Neuroscience Program University of Southern California
