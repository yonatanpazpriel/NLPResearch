From: William Josephs Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:50 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Regarding Ethnic Studies Curriculum
The State of California approved legislation that creates an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC") for public school students. The legislation marks the curriculum as an optional approved by the California Department of Education. Now another bill, AB-331, is under consideration to make Ethnic Studies a mandatory requirement for graduation, yet is impervious to the racial and other hatred suffered by Jews throughout history.
Jews have contributions greatly to California's history, politics, culture, and government. Yet our longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination is ignored. As proposed, the ESMC obliterates the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and does not stand with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. At a time when anti-Semitism is rife on college campuses across the nation, this blatant exclusion is consistent with propaganda and is impervious to the racial injustice done to the Jewish people, now and across time.
In great contrast, much attention is spent regarding Islamophobia; even though there are more than three times the recorded episodes of antiSemitism.
This curriculum slanders and vilified Israel and Jews, while taking a political stance which masquerades as moral, in support it the anti-Semitic, BDS movement.
It is in no manner acceptable.
