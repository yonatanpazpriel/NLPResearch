Dear Mr. Thurman, I am writing to protest the adaption of the Department of Ed of its proposed ethnic studies curriculum. The proposed curriculum is objectional as both anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. For example, the boycott, diverse meant and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel is described as a positive social movement seeking freedom for Palestinians when it is in fact the goal of the
founders of BDS is to eliminate Israel. The curriculum falsely equates how Israel treats Palestinian Arabs with how the US treats its African American citizens while Israel's intent is to protect its citizens from terrorists. As an occupational therapist employed by special ed in the public school systems of California, I am not only disturbed and offended that this curriculum would even be considered but fear for the future safety of my grandchildren that the message being sent in the public schools is that it is all right to be racist against people of the Jewish faith. Please vote against this curriculum that incites harm against Jews. Sincerely, Robin Goldfinger
