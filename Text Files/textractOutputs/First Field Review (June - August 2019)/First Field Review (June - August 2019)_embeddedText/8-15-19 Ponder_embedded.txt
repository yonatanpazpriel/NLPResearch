Assimilation has other positive meanings. Add those.

BDS � Where is Israel's voice in this document? Appears anti-semitic.

Capitalism � Sounds negative. My grandparents came to America because of capitalism and the rule of law. They started their own business. Big and little businesses are the life blood of our country. The thousands and thousands of businesses started by people of all races and cultural backgrounds are vital. We are lucky to have incentives for a better life through hard work, perseverance.

Cultural appropriation � Isn't this what America is all about � sharing food, ideas, customs, thoughts? It is a privilege to share with others and learn something new.

Gender � a confusing issue

Redlining � Banks need to know they will be paid back. My dad always told me, don't buy anything you cannot afford.

Whiteness � too one sided. Makes it appear that All whites are privileged and No minorities are privileged. I have seen examples of privilege in all races and cultures. Include the positive contributions of perceived oppressed and perceived unoppressed groups. Surely, we can find something good in most cultures. Include others: communism, dictatorships, totalitarianism, caste system. Communist China today is excellent example of oppressing people, imprisoning and torturing Muslims, harvesting organs of "enemies of the state" for transplants. The desperation of the people of Hong Kong show they are aware of true oppression.
Add loss of two parent family unit, poor education, low expectations

Lines 123/124

Give examples of people living in poor conditions who through education, hard work and an adult who cared about education became successful. Dr. Ben Carson comes to mind. Also, Kay Cole James.

Lines 166-167 General

Will both sides of arguments be accepted? This is a golden opportunity to improve debate skills. We taught our debate team to have facts to back up their statements so their arguments were persuasive and logical. Both teams were applauded at the end of debates. A positive experience for all.
Overall, this seems to be one sided instead of middle of the road. I feel that complex and disturbing facts of history need to be openly discussed with differing opinions respected. I hear young people today say they fear to speak up or have a different idea. We need our young people to recognize that different opinions are ok and logical persuasion is the way to go.

America has more successes in opportunity and freedoms that cause people to want to come here still. There was terrible racism in the 60s. Thirty years later, I learned one of my co-workers participated in lunch counter sit-ins. We were a diverse faculty and student population. We talked to students about episodes of courage in the past that made America a less racist country: because of people who stood up to racism, our students could go into any restaurant, they could vote, they could get an education with black teachers and white teachers and Asian teachers who worked together for their benefit. No white only fountains or bathrooms or hotels or beaches. Many were amazed there were times like these and glad that we had come so far.

We had a wonderful black male teacher who drove a nice car and was stopped on his way to our school. He told students that he kept his hands on the wheel, spoke respectfully to the officer and went on his way. He taught our middle schoolers how to handle difficult situations and improve their lives.

Today, students do need to learn of our terrible mistakes in the past and what we have done and still can do to improve.

I feel this curriculum highlights the negatives: anti-semitism and even anti-white and anti-male ideas as if all Jewish people and white people and men are terrible people. And finally, Political Propaganda should have NO place in our schools. Please make changes. I would not want to teach this as is.
