The California Legislative Jewish Caucus strongly objected to the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Here's what the Caucus rightly said: The ESMC Effectively Erases the American Jewish Experience: Despite the significant contributions that Jews have made to California history, politics, culture and government � and the Jewish community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � Jews are essentially omitted as an ethnic group in the ESMC. The ESMC Omits Anti-Semitism: While the ESMC specifically discusses bias against other communities, it omits any meaningful discussion of anti-Semitism. The ESMC Glossary includes the terms Racism, Sexism, Anthropocentrism, Cisheteropatriarchy, Heteropatriarchy, Classism, Colonialism, Homophobia, Imperialism, Islamophobia, Patriarchy, Transphobia, White Supremacy, and Xenophobia. It does not include the term Anti-Semitism.

The ESMC Denigrates Jews: In the few instances where the ESMC actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner. For example, the ESMC recommends song lyrics which say that Israelis "use the press so they can manufacture" � a classic anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews control the media. The ESMC Singles Out Israel for Condemnation: The ESMC promotes the antiSemitic, anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Movement, and singles out Israel � the only Jewish state in the world � for special criticism and condemnation that is both out of context and factually inaccurate.
