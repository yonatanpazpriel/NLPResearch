Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] If you are going to treat Arabs as an `ethnic group', you should be also treating Jews and other minorities as `ethnic groups', and teach their history and culture as well. BDS is anti-Semitic to the core (even if it has some Jews), and it's goal is to eliminate the Jewish state, depriving the Jews form a national home; after living for 2000 years as a minority without their own country. BDS falsifies history, distorts the truth and does not show the responsibility of the Arabs to this prolonged and non-ending war.
