From: Jonathan Blank Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model program?!!!
Dear Committee members, I cannot overstate how appalled I am that you would even consider implementing this garbage you call a "program".
What exactly is your agenda? Let's be clear: THIS PROGRAM IS INDOCTRINATION and you are either actively pushing this vile hatred or you are condoning this behavior.
STOP IMMEDIATELY!
This is wrong. What kind of future are you trying to create? You have been trusted with our most valuable resource-OUR CHILDREN- and you are failing them with this action.
Is there a forum where I can come to address my concern?
Please contact me as to where or when.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Jonathan D Blank
