From: Debbie Sent: Friday, August 2, 2019 10:58 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your draft Ethnic Studies curriculum is unbalanced.
Dear Ethnic Studies Team,
I was shocked to read how the State of California is currently reviewing a model of Ethnic Studies curriculum which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel exclusively, and omits antisemtism as a form of bigotry.
BDS is about `From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Free'. The destruction of the State of Israel.
Yet the indigenous language of Israel is Hebrew.
The indigenous people of Israel are Jews.
Arabs invaded the Middle East, including Judea, in 637CE. They colonised the whole region physically and culturally - making the indigenous Jews and also the Christans (mostly converted Jews) into `dhimmis' - second class citizens in their own land.
The Jewish People of Judea/Israel were expelled again and again by invasions of their land. But the Jewish People kept on returning to their home. Tiberius, Hebron, Safed and Jerusalem had a Jewish majority from the 1700s on.
`Palestinians' are Arabs who left their lands in the 1920s onward to migrate to the British Mandate, now Israel, to take advantage of the job opportunities created by British investment in the area. Jewish organisations were also contributing to the development.
From 1937 to 1945, even more Arabs entered what was now the nascent state of Israel. Churchill, wooing the Arab nations, promised them he would restrict and then finally stop Jews entering Israel (even though the UN had designated it as a Jewish homeland). At the same time, he turned a blind eye to the many thousands of Arabs that continued to flood into Israel. At this time, the term `Palestinian' referred to Jews living in their land - not to Arabs there.
The creation of the Arab `Palestinian' is described in the following paper: `Soviet Russia, Creator of the PLO and Inventor of the Palestinian People by Wallace Edward Brand :: SSRN. https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2387087
Zuheir Mohsen a Palestinian leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) between 1971 and 1979 also speaks of the creation of the Palestinian People. See below:
� "The Palestinian people do not exist. The creation of a Palestinian state is only a means for continuing our struggle against the state of Israel for our Arab unity. In reality today there is no difference between Jordanians, Palestinians, Syrians and Lebanese. Only for political and tactical reasons do we speak today about the existence of a Palestinian people, since Arab national interests demand that we posit the existence of a distinct "Palestinian people" to oppose

Zionism. Yes, the existence of a separate Palestinian identity exists only for tactical reasons, Jordan, which is a sovereign state with defined borders, cannot raise claims to Haifa and Jaffa, while as a Palestinian, I can undoubtedly demand Haifa, Jaffa, Beer-Sheva and Jerusalem. However, the moment we reclaim our right to all of Palestine, we will not wait even a minute to unite Palestine and Jordan."

Your Ethnic Studies draft curriculum is not taking the above history into account.
It is unbalanced.
It needs to be re-written.
