The proposed curriculum is unacceptable and is itself biased and offensive.

Instead of highlighting history of ethnic groups describing their characteristics and native culture, and their immigration and contributions, as one would expect, it appears to be in significant part a political indoctrination in one view of purported exploitation.

In one egregious example of the inherent bias, purporting to teach about marginalized communities, it includes no section on Jewish immigration and contributions; marginalizes Jews; omits antisemitism in the US and around the world; ignores the holocaust; demonizes Israel; and actively eviscerates the Jewish experience as an immigrant narrative. Entire industries in the US owe their origin ein significant part to this community which is omitted. For example, one of the most distinctive and important industries in California, the movie industry, is not covered at all. The history of Jewish American Nobel prize winners and important social justice advocates is nowhere to be found.

References to specific pages include page 2 as well as pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269.
