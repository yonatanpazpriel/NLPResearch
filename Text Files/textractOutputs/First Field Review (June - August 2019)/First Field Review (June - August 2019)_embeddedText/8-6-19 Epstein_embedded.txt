From: Becky Epstein Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 8:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The draft ESMC
I wholeheartedly agree with the analysis of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus in its letter of July 29, 2019 to the California Department of Education, which demonstrates, among other things, how the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC") is against California law and policy. Please act now to correct the significant errors and omissions in the ESMC as described in the Jewish Caucus' letter. To do otherwise is dangerous and reckless, particularly at this time of growing white nationalism and anti-Semitism.
Thank you,
Becky Epstein
