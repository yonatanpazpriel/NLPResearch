I'm writing about the proposed curriculum. I read the entire document online. Among my many concerns is the anti-Semitic and anti-Israel bias in this document.
The model curriculum promotes BDS and other anti-Israel movements without any context or consideration of the facts on both sides. Israel is NOT an apartheid country--Israeli Arabs have the right to vote, and they serve on the Supreme Court and in the Knesset (legislature.). Israel is the only country in the Middle East where there is freedom of religion. Comparing Israel to apartheid-era South Africa is blatant antiSemitism.
A model curriculum should NOT be politically biased as this one appears to be. Students should learn the facts and then be encouraged to draw their own conclusions.
I've been a Sacramento resident for over 40 years. My children attended local public schools and my grandchildren are currently enrolled in California public schools. This proposed curriculum is unfair to them, and it is unfair to all the children of California.
Thank you for your attention to these concerns. I hope to see a more neutral, unbiased document in the future--one that respects the heritage of all Californians.
