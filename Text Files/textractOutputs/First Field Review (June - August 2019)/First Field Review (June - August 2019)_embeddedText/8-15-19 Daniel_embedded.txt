While drafting a comprehensive plan for a California ethnic studies curriculum, please keep in mind that while there have been many ethnic, gender, and religious periods of discrimination in our state and country, there has also been tremendous growth to overcome these injustices. Education needs to focus on helping students to see the big picture and to become problem solvers. It could be argued that all ethnicities, genders, and religions have been discriminated against at some period in history. This understanding should be the goal of a successful ethnic studies curriculum.
It's critical to the peace and mental / emotional health of our state and country that groups cease seeing themselves as victims who are "owed," and start seeing themselves as part of an evolving civilization working toward the common good. Empathy towards others is productive, division is not. Whatever curriculum is ultimately adopted, I hope it empowers our students to seek equality and justice for all.
