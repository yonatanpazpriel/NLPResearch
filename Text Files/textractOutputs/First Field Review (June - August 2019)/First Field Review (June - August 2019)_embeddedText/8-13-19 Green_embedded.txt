To whom it may concern:
I totally agree with the following two paragraphs which I have copied and pasted:
The caucus letter goes on to outline ethnic stereotyping in the curriculum, asserting: "In the few instances where the [curriculum] actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner." The draft recommends that teachers quote lyrics by British Palestinian recording artist Shadia Mansour asserting that "Israelis `use the press so they can manufacture,' a classic anti-Semitic trope about Jewish control of the media." In other words, saying this is about Israel, not about Jews, doesn't pass scrutiny when language long used to foment anti-Semitism is recommended. For that matter, even if it were only about Israel, it would be wrong for a public school curriculum to take one side or the other in a complex and deeply controversial international dilemma.
As a mother of kids who went through the public school system (and who would have refused to place them in a course that made them feel attacked for their minority identity), as a journalist who considers it crucial to listen to and consider all sides of a debate and allow people to voice their views without fear of retribution, and as a Jewish resident of California, this makes me question the competence, objectivity and intent of the committee that drew up the curriculum.
