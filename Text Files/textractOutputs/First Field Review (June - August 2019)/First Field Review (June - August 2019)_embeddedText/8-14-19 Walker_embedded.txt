Ms. Soomin Chao, Chair, Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
Dear Ms. Chao and Honorable Commission Members:
Thank you for this opportunity for public comment on CDE's proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I applaud your intentions and actions to acknowledge the legitimacy and contributions of California's innumerable and varied ethnic groups so that California students and all California citizens may fully embrace the concept of inclusion.
Having perused the draft curriculum, I have serious concerns about the minimal, biased, and inaccurate references to Jews. The draft seems to skew in favor of Palestinian sympathies, and whereas the Palestinians have legitimate and important disputes and claims, the issue has two very complex sides with a very long and equally complex history. The current standoff between the two ethnic groups-- Jews and Palestinians--did not evolve in a vacuum. Fairness demands inclusion of the expertise of fair and open-minded historians who can parse historical events and offer critical distinctions that are absent in the draft and in much of today's media coverage (which may in part account for the skew in the draft).
As Assembly Member Marc Berman stated in today's press conference, "It is critically important that we don't pit groups against each other." This is the time to present every group's story objectively and fairly.
Thank you again for this opportunity to make public comment.
Respectfully, Carolyn Walker Sacramento
