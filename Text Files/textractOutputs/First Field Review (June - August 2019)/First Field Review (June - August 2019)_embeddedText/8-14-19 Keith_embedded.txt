The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is a travesty. As it stands today, it is an unbalanced, inaccurate and blatant smear of Jewish people and the State of Israel. The ESMC is biased and false. I refer to the following pages of the ESMC: Pages: 237, 242, 264-269, 284. These pages either exclude Jewish content or they present a one-sided perspective with no balance in representing the "other" side.
On a personal note; My grandparents fled Europe at a time when Jews were being maligned in the print media and in the halls of academia. We know the result. This false curriculum is reminiscent of 1939 Germany. The deception it proffers is harmful & subversive. "Never again!" is a meaningless mantra to those with such short memories of history.
Please do the right thing! Take responsibility for providing students with thoughtful, accurate, complete information. Do not plant seeds of HATE. Jan Keith Lake Forest
