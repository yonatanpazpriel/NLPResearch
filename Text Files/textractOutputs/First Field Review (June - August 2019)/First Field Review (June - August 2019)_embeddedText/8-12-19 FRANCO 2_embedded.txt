From: MARK ANTHONY FRANCO Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:48 AM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Public Comment Process for the Ethnic Studies Curriculum Model
Good Morning,
My name is Mark Franco, a concerned citizen who is a former LAUSD student and teacher. I have a question about public comment regarding the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I was wondering if those submitting public comment need to be California Residents or if there is a mechanism for the CA Department of Education to verify those who submit public comments are CA residents.
The reason I inquire is because I have become aware of various politicized organizations rallying individuals on social media and encouraging them to submit public comment on the California Ethnic Studies Curriculum Model independent of whether these individuals are California residents or American citizens.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Best,
Mark Franco
