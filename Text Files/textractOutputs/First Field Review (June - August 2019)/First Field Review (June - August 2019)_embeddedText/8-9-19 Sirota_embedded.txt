From: Anne S Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 1:18 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
I am a former teacher, a former university educator, a parent of two former students of California public schools, and a grandparent of two California public school students. I was extremely distressed that a new Assembly bill established a model ethnic studies curriculum in California that blatantly demonized the only Jewish nation in the world and promoted an antisemitic agenda. Though I believe a model ethnic studies curriculum is commendable and even necessary, this one is totally unacceptable.
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Anne Sirota Northridge, California
