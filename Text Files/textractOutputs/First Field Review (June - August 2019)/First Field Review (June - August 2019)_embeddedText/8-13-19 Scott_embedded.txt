From: Dan Scott Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Feedback on the program
Students need to be taught how to read & write as well as how to think critically to become problem solvers for the future. They do not need to be taught leftist ideology. The program is just indoctrination.and totally inappropriate for public schools. I have grandchildren in CA schools. I was also an elementary teacher for 15 years. Let's focus on the 3 R's and math skills with kids learning HOW to think instead of WHAT to think. Thank you! > > Sent from my iPhone
