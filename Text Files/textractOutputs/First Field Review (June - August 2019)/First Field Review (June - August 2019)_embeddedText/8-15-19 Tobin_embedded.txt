From: Renee Tobin Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:52 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Curriculum
Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the proposed curriculum. One of my greatest concerns is that the proposed curriculum appears to include a particular point of view on economics. While economics may have a place in this area of study the curriculum should not be a proponent of one economic system over another. Another serious error in the document is the omission of the study of anti-Semitism that still infects some in our society today.
#153-158 are excellent outcomes to strive for.
#35 "History". The word history does not refer to male. The root is from the French "estoire" meaning story and traces even further back to ancient Greek "historia" or learning by inquiry. We need to teach students the truth not modern misinterpretation.
This is a challenging undertaking and I wish you well with it.
Sincerely,
Renee Vasos Tobin Rancho Cucamonga, CA Retired public librarian
