As a school counselor, when I initially read today's article on the ethnic studies course requirement I was pleased...until I read further. During my lifetime both myself and my children have experienced anti-Semitism multiple times including experiences with it in California public schools and colleges. Recently, a swatstika was drawn on my daughter's dorm at UCSD and the Poway temple that experienced the tragic anti-Semitic based shooting was one my other daughter attended for a short time. AntiSemitism is a very real problem in California and our country as a whole so it is shocking that a curriculum based on ethnic studies wouldn't address it or the experiences of ongoing prejudice in this country against Jews. Some people think being Jewish is just about religion but it is an ethnicity as proven by DNA. Is there any other religious group that can be identified by DNA? The answer is no...not even Islam. So yes the experience of the Jewish people in the United States and antisemitism belongs in an ethnic studies course. If this is not included in an ethnic studies course then California is not ready to make this a requirement and a process needs to put in place to insure a fair curriculum that addresses all ethnic groups that experience discrimination.
