Dear Sir or Madam:
I am a lifelong supporter of ethnic studies and social justice. However, I was appalled to read about the proposed ethnic studies program at LAUSD in the August 9th edition of the LA Times and how it was presented on Air Talk with Larry Mantle on August 12th.
According to these sources, Jews are not included in the curriculum to promote diversity and tolerance, despite that fact that hate crimes against Jews have increased more than those against any other minority group except Hispanics. Hate crimes against Jews in California have increased more than those against Blacks and Muslims.
Worse yet, the curriculum promotes the BDS movement as a worthy cause. Perhaps the people who developed the proposed curriculum are not aware that BDS doesn't limit itself to the rights of the Palestinian people to statehood. In the spirit of its cofounder, Omar Bhargouti, BDS calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and the rights of the Jewish people, as well as the Palestinian people, to a safe homeland. Despite the defense that this is an enquiry based curriculum where students are encouraged to investigate and make their own decisions, we know that students are often afraid to disagree with their teacher and eager to produce a paper which supports the teacher's views in order to get a good grade.
Finally, and what I find most reprehensible, is that it recommends that teachers quote the song lyrics of Shadia Mansour that "Israelis use the press to manufacture" the news. This is a classic antisemitic trope which has been used against Jews for over a century.
Thank you for opening up this curriculum to public comment. Merriam Webster defines ethnic as "large groups of people classed according to ...religious, linguistic, or cultural background." That certainly includes Jews.
Respectfully, Jaque Milofsky
