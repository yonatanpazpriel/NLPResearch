To Whom it May Concern,
I support introduction of Ethnic Studies into North County San Diego curriculum, but I don't support prejudiced information taught to our students. I'm specifically writing about curriculum that will be taught to students in Arab American section. Many positions that are expressed in above-mentioned unit clearly prejudice and incite strong feelings of hate and distaste for Jews in America and also all over the world. Jews are already targeted all over the world, including here at home. The information presented to students depict Jews as aggressors and oppressors. It's really far from the truth. The land that is Israel now, always belonged to Jews and Arabs. At that time they lived in peace, until others got involved . You should really learn the history and stop inciting hatred among innocent students. Tell the facts, instead of bunch of politically correct information.
