From: Lemos, Alice Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:29 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: teaching anti-Semitism in California schools
This new "curriculum" is an abomination. You depict Israel and Jews in a negative light when the State of Israel has accomplished so much over the years including great developments in medicine. Shame on you for encouraging violence against Jews at the behest of Islamists and leftists!
