From: Karen Pasternak Straus Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:02 PM To: Tony Thurmond Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am distressed by the deep,y flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I find it unconscionable that Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned, and that AntiSemitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. How can the BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, be included with no balancing perspective? I come from am immigrant family that has worked hard to earn a place in the US -- and does not control the media (nor even any significant assets.) I love both our country and Israel, respect the Palestinian people and am pained by their suffering but, and believe that there can be peace with with a two state solution. I do not feel fairly represented in the curriculum and fear the damage that could be done by the current proposal!
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Karen Straus Oakland, ca
