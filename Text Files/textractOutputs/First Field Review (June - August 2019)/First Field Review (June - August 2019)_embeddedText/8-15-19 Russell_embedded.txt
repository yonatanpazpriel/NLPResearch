" The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression, including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, that continue to impact the social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political experiences of Native People/s and people of color." p. 2, ll 27-31 Why no mention of anti-Semitism? Jews are increasingly being targeted by hate groups. Remember Charlottesville, Pittsburgh, Poway?

P. 35: Why include BDS? This deals with a foreign country, but only one point of view. This course is the study of oppression in the U.S.; BDS believes oppression only of Palestinians, where there has been wrong on both sides in Israel. Inclusion of Edward Said, Palestinian rights activist, not appropriate. (p. 152) P. 42: What if students don't want to share family immigration history because it includes undocumented people? Curriculum does not appear sensitive to the needs of those students.

BDS: definition states it is "anti-apartheid". The term "apartheid" has specific references to the history of South Africa and is not comparable to the situation in Israel.

- Very good teacher support. A lot of student-centered activity.

However, I am concerned that if this course is mandated for graduation in California, would it replace American history? This course is very unbalanced, making it seem as though all of American history is about oppression of minorities. Of course these negative aspects abound, but if students have not yet been given a better grounding in American history, they will not know context or be able to have nuanced discussions of these problems. Our job as educators is to develop the critical thinking skills necessary for responsible participatory citizenship. I fear that this course runs the risk of inculcating only negative stereotypes about our country. Much more balance is needed in the revision.
