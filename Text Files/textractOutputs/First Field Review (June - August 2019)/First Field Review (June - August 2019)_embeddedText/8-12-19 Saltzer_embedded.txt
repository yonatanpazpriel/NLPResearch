From: Robin Saltzer Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 6:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC Public Input
Please accept this form as my attempt to voice my concern over the current proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
I am a mother of three boys who all attend a public middle school in Orange County. I am also a public school teacher and a Jewish American. When I heard about this draft, it immediately sickened and saddened me. There is no doubt in my mind that my children would suffer as a result from this blatant bias against Israel and almost complete omission of the American Jewish experience.
At a time of rising incidences of anti-Semitism in my own community, across the country, and around the world, it is more important than ever that young adults of all backgrounds understand the Jewish experience. Part of this understanding is the appreciation for the Jewish cultural, religious, historical and spiritual connection to the land and State of Israel. The current curriculum shows a shocking indifference, and even hostility towards, the American Jewish experience and community. The curriculum erases American Jewish history by failing to include Jews in a meaningful way, and it neglects any discussion of anti-Semitism. It is important for society to understand that Judaism is first a peoplehood with original homeland in the land of Israel. Judaism is not simply a religion. Jewish identity encompasses not just a connection to a faith tradition; it is also an ethnic and cultural identification. Jews are a distinct and diverse American ethnic group deserving fair and respectful inclusion in any Ethnic Studies curriculum. The ESMC as it is currently drafted; however, fails to impart these basic lessons.
Please accept my concerns that are attached to this email.

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply troubling. The Jewish community urges you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in former Soviet Union.

Chapter 2 Glossary

Page 234 - Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico
Page 237 - Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country
Page 242 - Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives
Page 256, 264 � 269 - Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders
A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
