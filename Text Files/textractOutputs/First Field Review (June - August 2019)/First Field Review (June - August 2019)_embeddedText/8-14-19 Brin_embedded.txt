To Whom It May Concern:
Please forgive me for the length of this reply, but I only heard of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines last week, and only discovered last Thursday that it contained an astonishing series of lies regarding the anti-student Black Students Union Riots at San Francisco State during the late 1960s. They are also lies about me and the experiences of 18,000 other students.
As a student leader during this period, and the whistleblower whose information brought the riots to a close, I can assure you that nothing contained within the Curriculum Guidelines regarding the attacks against the students, faculty, and property of San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University) can be regarded as anything other than propaganda, misdirection, disinformation, and lies.
It should be noted in passing that the entire concept of compulsory instruction in "Ethnic Studies," a subject dominated by racism, political ideology, and grievance picking is likely to be overturned in the courts. State-sponsored political indoctrination is a violation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. A more appropriate course of studies should be "Peoples and Cultures of California."
As a professional journalist and expert in anti-Semitism and anti-Israel propaganda, I found the entire document to be little more than racist disinformation. The outsized "Arab-American" section ignores critical questions of Arab culture and dismisses the regions endless parade of civil, tribal, and religious wars as "U.S. imperialism."
Regarding San Francisco State, the guidelines are bald racist fiction, a thin-air concoction, a fraud against the Department of Education and the people of California. Whether their assertions and assumptions originated as negligent mistakes they were created by alleged academic experts. These people knew better, or should have.
Ethnic Studies, as defined by the provided Guidelines is neither history, ethnography, nor sociology. It appears to be little more than state-sponsored propaganda intended to set communities against each other with clear favorites. Its goal is to promote racial tensions and what might be called "brown revenge."
For reasons of brevity � I have not had sufficient time to thoroughly examine the entire document � I will stress one problematic area contained in the guidelines on which I have a unique qualification: The 1968-1969 Black Students Union Riots at San Francisco State, earlier anti-student attacks by the BSU at the same institution, and the subsequent cover-up.
I refer you my article on subject BSU violence. I will leave to others the exposure of the document's blatant anti-Semitism and advocacy of illegal "BDS" racism. I have also added a brief addendum on the facetious dismissal of the word "terrorism."

The Black Students Union Riots at San Francisco State
Please refer to the section "Lesson Steps/Activities, Section 1" on page 30 (line 641 through 647) of the file samplecoursemodelsesmc.docx, in which the authors state the following:
1. Begin the lesson by defining what social movements are and how they start. Introduce the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement and the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike (emphasis added) to students. Include in the introduction/overview pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting. Throughout the overview, highlight that the Ethnic Studies Movement was successful due to unity and solidarity building, as well as drawing on momentum from other movements that were happening simultaneously, like, the Black Power, American Indian, Anti-war, Asian American, Chicano, United Farm Workers, and Women's Liberation movements.
Where shall I begin?
As a close eyewitness to the riots at San Francisco State from September, 1966 through February, 1969, both as a member of the Student Legislature and as the California Attorney General's source for the evidence that shut the riots down, I can state that the above paragraph is utter nonsense. It is unrecognizable to anyone on the ground at the time, on either side. In fact, the section contains several nonsensical statements and outright lies. I will parse a few phrases:
1. "Ethnic Studies Movement" � There was no so-called "Ethnic Studies Movement" per se at San Francisco State during the riots of the late 1960s. Instead, there was a demand for what was then called Black Studies. The demand was made by the Black Students Union, not by the grandly named, so-called "Third World Liberation Front". While the TWLF did issue a copycat set of "nonnegotiable demands," theirs was an afterthought to the events.
The tone and direction of the violence was set by the original members of the original chapter of the Black Students Union, a gang of brutal, racist, and antiSemitic thugs, not the TWLF. And yet the term "Black Students Union, doesn't even appear in the document's index.
The BSU acted as bullyboys for a group of overtly criminal student politicians installed by the Dean of Activities, Jim Andrews by means of fraudulent elections. I am proud to have been instrumental in Andrews' dismissal for committing numerous violations of the California Education and Corporations Codes.
Several more deans and at least one campus president were later dismissed after I went to the State Attorney General (then a Democrat by the name of Tom Lynch. I worked directly with his deputy in charge of non-profit fraud, Joanne Condass.)

During the period of the 1968-1969 anti-student riots, the State Attorney General's office estimated that leftist student politicians and the BSU absconded with over $10 million in student funds (in current terms).
2. (Omitted Term) "Black Studies" � The demand for "Black Studies" (not "Ethnic Studies") was a political tactic of the Black Students Union, essentially a demand that a previously-planned "Black Studies" department and its funding be removed from academic control and turned over to the BSU self-appointed leadership. These leaders would choose "professors" whose sole qualification was adherence to, and promotion of, the BSU's violent and criminal party line. There would be no academic oversight.
This demand was illegal, a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the US Constitution, the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and various laws of the State of California. In fact, the demand was intended to be a form of patronage � as I will explain further on, the BSU was entirely corrupt and was never interested in scholarship but in extortion, embezzlement, indoctrination and the imposition of a climate of intimidation and fear. Its motives were a combination of racism, greed, and psychopathy.
Perhaps this is why the term "Black Students Union" is omitted from the document, apparently deliberately.
3. "Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike" � This term is an outright lie. The use of the term "Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike" appears to be a competitive renaming of a historical event by promoters of non-Black Ethnic Studies promoters. Apparently, they desire to grab semantic control from promoters of Black or African-American studies. In 1968, the so-called TWLF was a small, secondary, merely semi-violent group that had little to do with the ensuing attacks on students and existed mainly on its margins. By my experience, Unlike the BSU, the TWLF consisted largely of psychologically normal people.
On the other hand, the BSU leadership, including the future movie actor Danny Glover, was violent and belligerent, even comically so � they tended to communicate with ordinary students in histrionic growls and grunts. The so-called "Student Strike," � a four month long orgy of daily riots (11 a.m. to 1 p.m.) that lasted from November 6, 1968 through mid-February, 1969 � was declared entirely by the so-called "central committee" of the BSU and endorsed by the existing, largely white and entirely radical leftist leadership of the Associated Students. This leadership assumed power by means of well-documented election fraud and voter intimidation. The radicals never consulted the students of SFSU they declared their "strike". There was no strike vote.
It should be noted that the riots were declared on Nov. 6, 1968 to celebrate the one year anniversary of the firebombing of Merced Hall and a brutal BSU attack on the SF State student newspaper only four hours later. The TWLF was not directly involved. All of those who surrendered to the police following the Gater attack were members or associates of the BSU, not the TWLF.

"Include in the introduction/overview pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting." � This is another lie, a brutal yet common one. To be blunt, there were no "protests," there were riots, fascist-style rallies, and violent assaults against students and faculty:
 300 fires set in classrooms and on other university property  Firebombs, including a massive example in Merced Hall, while 400 students
were asleep.  Bombs (See Orrick, below)  Mass beatings and assaults. (A group of grinning, laughing white radicals
threw a steel trash can at me through a plate glass door. Such fun!)  Vandalism  Organized sexual assaults (Female BSU members and followers would gather
around the streetcar stops and as students descended to the sidewalk, grab testicles and pinch and twist breasts.)
Perhaps David Orrick said it best in Shut It Down! his report on the SF State riots to the national Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence:
By the end of the semester on January 31, 1969, there had been 731 arrests on campus; more than 80 students were reported injured as they were arrested, and others were hurt and not arrested. Thirty-two policemen were injured on the campus. Damage to campus buildings exceeded $16,000; there were scores of small fires and a major one in a vice president's office. Eight bombs were planted on campus, and two firebombs were hurled at and into the home of an assistant to the president. In mid-February, a campus guard received head injuries from a bomb that exploded at the entrance to the administration building. Three weeks later, on March 5, 1969, a 19-year-old [black] sophomore in social sciences was partially blinded and maimed when a time bomb-which police said he was installing exploded in the Creative Arts Building. Ordnance specialists discovered two other bombs, one of them with six sticks of dynamite, in a nearby room.
Orrick's report is available online. These acts of violence were largely committed by the Black Students Union and its members, not the TWLF. It should be noted that the bomber mentioned in the above paragraph was not expelled but returned to class the following semester, after he recovered from his injuries.
In fact, the only student participants from SF State were the roughly 1,800 out of a total of 18,000 students who supported radical politics. The rest of the students were simply forced off campus. Following the riots, a clerk in the registrar's office told me that 4,000 students voted with their feet. They transferred away and never returned to SF State.

4. "Women's Liberation" � I don't remember an active "Women's Liberation" movement at the time. Campus Second Wave feminism appears to have been a product of the 1970s, and many of its leaders, such as Betty Freidan, were Jewish and became Zionist after the Soviet-dominated 1975 Mexico Conference. Such leaders would be horrified by current feminist leadership dominated by "Intersectional" anti-Semitism, of which these Guidelines are an example.
5. Anti-War � While there was an "anti-war" movement at SFSU, it was not responsible for the BSU attacks on students. It did organize violent attacks on military recruiters and students who supported them. (See bestseller "Recon Force at Midnight" by Dr. Bill Peters in which the author describes a widely photographed assault by "anti-war" militants and subsequent efforts by leftist administrators at SF State to expel him for having been attacked.)
6. Asian American � Asian-Americans at SF State were a small and highly integrated minority in the 1960s. Most appeared to be third, even fourth generation Americans who did not have accents, did not speak an ancestral language and had no interest in learning it.
Actually the idea that Asian-Americans have a common experience is ridiculous on its face. What does the grandchild Vietnamese "boat-people" have in common with Filipino-Americans, Overseas Chinese, Koreans, or American Chomoros from Guam? The idea that they would is itself racist. And why is the late Palestinian propagandist and forger Edward Said listed among Asian-Americans on page 149, line 3108?
7. "Defin[e] what social movements are and how they start" � The guidelines imply that social movements are exclusively extreme leftist grievance movements, such as Ethnic Studies. All other social movements are excluded, including the trade and industrial labor movements.
Later, on the same page, under the heading "Lesson Steps/Activities," teachers are asked to do the following:
1. Begin the lesson by defining what social movements are and how they start. Introduce the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement and the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike to students. Include in the introduction/overview pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting... (Page 30, lines 639-647)
Again, the authors repeat the lie that the TWLF was in charge of the BSU Riots, that they were a "strike," and that the stated goal of the riots was "Ethnic Studies" rather than "Black Studies." and that the small, radical minority represented the students of SF State, and that the radicals were "protesting" something � they were using violence to enforce demands. If student articles are to be presented, they should include those written by journalism students rather than paid employees of radical-controlled fronts. These journals are:

 The Gater, before it was taken over by the radical-controlled Board of Publications.
 The Phoenix, published by the Department of Journalism after the Gater takeover.
Students should also be urged to read the Orrick book cited earlier, and my own article on the university's tapestry of lies on these matters, SFSU Whitewashes History at calwatchdog.com.
Students should be encouraged to understand the difference between journalism and propaganda, and how they would feel if their compulsory student fees were used to verbally insult them and to create lies. If pictures and videos of the violence are to be presented to promote the extremists' narrative, classes should also include:
 Video of members of the BSU and their white radical allies assaulting students
 Video of members of the Black Students Union goose-stepping, Nazi-style, while presenting a stiff-arm salute
 Pictures of the Black Students Union beating up student journalists on Nov. 6, 1967.
 Pictures of the Merced Hall fire, a nighttime arson attack intended to kill 400 sleeping students at 6 a.m., also on Nov. 6, 1967, including the author of this submission. The university still denies that these events ever happened.
 Video of a mass rally in which white radicals hypnotize themselves by chanting and screaming "Black Power!" in unison while stiff-arm saluting. The video should be compared with a German Nazi rally of the followers of Hitler behaving in precisely the same way to the chant "Sieg heil!" � the only difference would be the use of a closed hand at SF State and an open one in Germany
The following section on the same page urges teachers to divide students into pairs, providing each group with two primary source documents. Among the sources are:
e. Student and Black Panther Party newspaper clippings featuring articles about the TWLF strike. (Page 30, lines 656-657)
This is clearly an attempt to control information for propaganda purposes, as both the "student newspaper" (meaning only the Gater, then under radical control) and the Black Panther Party newspaper would have supported the BSU-led violence against the students of SF State. None of the mentioned source documents include news items concerning the riots, nor does it include any student sources which might provide a non-extremist view of the events. Teachers are then asked to:
3. Introduce each of the materials, providing a small amount of context, and a brief overview of what is a primary source.

There is no requirement for balance and fact-checking. On the following page, page 31, the students are asked to study various "social movements," all of them leftist. Among them is:
viii. Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement for Palestine
It should be noted that "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions" is a racist concept whose leaders' goal is total genocide of Israeli Jews. As such, this section may constitute a violation of the federal Proxmire Act, an implementation of the international Genocide Convention, which criminalizes genocide propaganda, and provides sentences of up to five years in prison.
Missing Movements Notably missing from the Guideline's list are other social movements that the contemporary left instinctively despises, often without documentation or any form of responsible research. Among these are:
 The Zionist Movement, the Jewish national liberation movement, which has been subjected to a flood of lies and distortions unparalleled in history. Students should be taught to distinguish between actual Zionist ideas and actions and fabricated and racist propaganda directed at Israel and Israelis. Students should be provided with examples of fabricated news stories, such as the Al-Durah Affair, and the truth that emerged.
 The Labor Movement � Other than the United Farm Workers, the American Labor Movement is entirely missing from the guidelines, possibly because many of its founders and leaders, such as Samuel Gompers, were Jews.
 The Intersectionalist Anti-Semitist/Anti-Zionist Movement, a pseudo-leftist, pseudo-scholarly trend among the feminist left, has converted the Zionist Movement into little more than a curse word to be used as synonymous expletive meaning "filthy Jew." It should be noted that while Third and Fourth Wave feminist orthodoxy https://wgsdept.sfsu.edu/news-all/25404 requires Intersectionality, Second Wave feminists firmly rejected firmly anti-Semitism and adopted Zionism after experiencing Soviet sponsored anti-Semitism.

Addendum: Arab American Studies Course Outline
Under the heading "Arab-American Stereotypes," the authors of the Guidelines state the following on Page 244, line 5557:
Palestinians: terrorists, blow up airlines, try to "destroy Israel" and "drive the Jews into the sea"
The word "stereotype" implies a false assumption. In fact, every major Palestinian party or political organization has this goal, without exception. The authors should state how this might not be true among Palestinian Americans and why. If they can't, the text should be dropped. The following is an example of contemporary Palestinian "destroy Israel" propaganda (see above) taken from the official Palestinian Fatah organization's Facebook page for internal consumption:

The poster is self-explanatory. Note the symbol on the skulls. I have many more such posters, cartoons, and videos that I can submit. On Page 229, lines 4933 though 4936, the Guidelines state:
...students will be exposed to how Arab Americans, along with non-Arab Muslims, South Asians, Sikhs, and others, have suffered from being perceived as a domestic enemy in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.

In fact, a group of Jewish Israeli men were among those arrested and badly mistreated after 9/11, mainly for speaking a foreign language while the Twin Towers burned. The paragraph continues on line 4936 through 4938:
These negative sentiments toward Arab Americans stem primarily from ignorance, but they also reflect a troubled relationship between the US and the Arab world as a result of US imperialism.
This is a remarkable statement, evocative of Soviet Cold War propaganda, but no evidence is presented. The United States possessed no territory in the area, and had no ambitions to control any. In fact, the "troubled relationship between the US and the Arab world" was caused by factors entirely out of the control of the United States, mainly propaganda mills operated by Egypt's fascist dictator Gamal Nasser and the Soviet KGB, both in need of a bogeyman.
After the fall of the Soviet Empire and the opening of the KGBs records, the Marxist "imperialism" model of modern Middle Eastern history became bankrupt. The only one left is the cultural, social, and religious model.
I wish that I had time to present more information.
