Page 2 Section B line 30 � If you look closely at the BDS movement and its goals you will see that it is hurting many Palestinians and its ultimate goal is does not recognize an Israeli State.
Page 234 line 4957 � BDS movement is not an ethical movement (see comments above) Page 237 line 5024 � Arab nations are highlighted but there is no mention of highlighting the only Jewish nation in the world "ISRAEL" Page 242 line 5154 � the Palestinian story in the curriculum is one sided, it does not cover the complicated relationships between all the Arab nations and their position in the displacement of the Arabs in the Palestinian territories. It does not cover the history of the land during the Ottomans and the land divisions the British created. This is a deeper history that needs to be explored rather than just throwing in terms such as "Nakba". Our children need facts to have a better understanding of the region not just soundbites.

We need to teach our students inclusion by including the Jewish history in CA. There is no mention of the Immigration of the Jews as an ethnic group who suffered oppression. There is no mention of the immigration of Jews from Arab countries to CA due to persecution in their countries � see Persian Jewish, Egyptian, Syrian Jewish history and more!

State of Israel is Arab with full voting rights and representatives in the government. A similar history as California which belonged to Mexico and was annexed by the US. The result of rappers such as Shadia Mansour is not to bring about peace but continue hatred and promote the victimhood of the Palestinian people. In order to teach peace the education department needs to tap into artists such as David Broza Sadia Mansour is not using her lyrics as a tool in the direction of peace but encouraging hatred. Her role in the division of men and women is one that should be highlighted but not her hatred for Israel!
This curriculum is very anti-Israel as well as anti-Semitic. Its focus is primarily on the Palestinians and no other Arabs including Jews from Arab nations.
The Jewish people are an ethnic group and their migration to CA needs to be included in the curriculum. Speak of the oppression of Jews in the Soviet Union and Middle East and resulting migration to California. Please add and revise curriculum. I do not approve for my children to be taught this material.
