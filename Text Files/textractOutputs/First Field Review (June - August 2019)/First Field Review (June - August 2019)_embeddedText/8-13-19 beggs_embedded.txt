Lines 39-45 Students of color are owed. What? You're handicapping these kids and making them victims all over again Line 71 People don't fit in neat tidy boxes as you'd like to think. Lines 1283 All Lives Matter! The Michael Brown tragedy of which Black Lives Matter was created has been investigated by the DOJ under the Obama Admin. There was no fault on the officers part. Again this curriculum looks at some of the legitimate past failing of this American culture and brings them forward as if they are still current. The issue in the larger cities of poverty and crime are the result of attempts by Democratic leaders to socially engineer a population. Capitalism is not racist. An idea is not racist. Meritocracy is not racist. They are based on the idea of ingenuity, effort and vision and that sirs knows no color, age, gender, sexual orientation. Give these kids hope instead of a lump of coal!
