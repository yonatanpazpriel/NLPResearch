First, I would like to thank the committee and everyone involved for all your hard work. It is a challenging effort to provide these much-needed ethnic studies curriculum materials to California students.

However, I believe there should be at least two courses. There is too much material for just one semester. Without sufficient time for thorough explanations of different groups and their circumstances, students may become very confused.

Page 47, Line 924 Course Title "African American Experience" is misleading. There is no one singular African American experience that is the same for all people of African descent in the U.S. (more below)

Page49, Line 982 Re African American names mentioned--this list appears to be somewhat random and refers to an extremely small sample of names. It does not give students any kind of comprehensive understanding of the great achievements of both historical and contemporary figures missing from the list.
It is not enough to say that the list "is in no way exhaustive". Some instructors may not have sufficient background to come up with an appropriately comprehensive list on their own.
For example, this extremely basic list fails to include the following: 1. Former U.S. President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama 2. Former U.S. Congresswoman, Shirley Chisholm, first black woman to run for U.S. President. 3. Former U.S. Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice 4. U.S. Senator Cory Booker 5. U.S. Senator Kamala Harris 6. Nobel Prize winners, Ralph Bunche, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Former President Barack Obama, Toni Morrison 7. Pulitzer Prize winners, August Wilson, Suzan Lori-Parks, Isabel Wilkerson 8. Black Billionaire U.S. businesspeople (not sports figures or entertainers), per Forbes Magazine- Robert Smith and David Seward
Page 49, Line 990 1. With regard to historical figures, the name of Frederick Douglass is misspelled. 2. On February 25, 1870, Hiram Rhodes Revels was seated as the first black member of the Senate, while Blanche Bruce, also of Mississippi, seated in 1875, was the second. Revels was the first black member of the Congress overall.
Page 49, Line 977 1. Currently, this sample curriculum neglects to explain or even mention the ways in which a significant number of people of African descent (both historically and in contemporary times) have made major positive contributions to U.S. society, as well as to their own various communities. (There is no one singular "African American community.)

2. The current sample curriculum makes it appear as if all African Americans are poor, undereducated, deprived, either already in or headed for the criminal justice system. This is misleading.
3. The curriculum needs to display a sophisticated understanding of diverse contemporary U.S. and global workplaces. The curriculum should include research projects and extensive outside readings, so students will be able to use the class to move forward in their own lives to become successful, productive and contributive U.S. citizens.
4. Students should not be made to view this curriculum as suggesting they are all potential social outcasts or criminals.
5. The curriculum needs more of a balance-- of accurate and appropriately empowering, as well as problem-oriented material.
6. In order to improve that balance, the curriculum needs additional pertinent information about specific historical and contemporary African Americans and how they overcame challenges to achieve major successes. (more below).

Page 233, Line 4920 1. I do not understand why this course is entitled "Arab American Studies". 2. A more appropriate title would be "Middle East Studies". 3. Currently, this course model does not provide a balanced representation of the Middle Eastern area. 4.There should be an equal inclusion of issues regarding Armenian, Jewish, and other groups from that area.

Page 237, Line 5030 According to the U.N., there is no country called "Israel-Palestine".

On November 29, 1947 the United Nations adopted Resolution 181 (also known as the Partition Resolution) that would divide Great Britain's former Palestinian mandate into Jewish and Arab states in May 1948 when the British mandate was scheduled to end. Creation of Israel, 1948 - Office of the Historian - United States ... https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/creation-israel 1. There is no mention of Anti-Semitism or the Holocaust in this projected course segment or in the entire curriculum. 2. There is no mention of the Armenian Genocide. 3. A solely Arab-centric approach does not seem appropriate because it does not allow students to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex historical and contemporary issues in that area.

Again, I thank the committee for all of your hard work with regard to this important curriculum development.
