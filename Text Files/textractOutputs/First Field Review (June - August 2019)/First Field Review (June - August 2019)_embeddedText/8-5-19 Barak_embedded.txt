As an educator, it's disturbing to me that this document contains such anti-Israel bias. High level, challenging curriculum should present various sides of an issue, especially with an issue so deeply complicated as this.

Also, studies have shown that BDS promotes hatred toward Jews in general on college campuses, which is quite a dangerous thing.

I want to encourage the inclusion of American Jews as an ethnic group, too. Almost all Jews immigrated to the U.S. because of persecution in Europe, Russia, and the Middle East and high school students need to know this. Jews have historically been the most persecuted ethnic minority in the world (whether religious or not) so it doesn't seem right that ethnic studies curriculum wouldn't include them.

Please, err on the side of inclusion and historical understanding FOR ALL ethnic minorities in this document!
