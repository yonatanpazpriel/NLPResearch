A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

Chapter 2 Karen Fouts

Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives and includes a suggested discussion to boycott, divest and sanction Israel (p. 234; line 4957).

Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).

Chapter 2 Karen Fouts

Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237; lines 5027-5032).

Chapter 2 Karen Fouts

Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242; lines 5154-5163).

Chapter 2 Karen Fouts

Encourages teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public - a common antisemitic slur (pp. 256, 264-269).

Chapter 2 Karen Fouts

Includes a totally biased and false characterization of U.S. foreign policy toward the Arab world as "U.S. imperialism." This sounds more like an excerpt from an Arab textbook � and does not belong in a U.S. course guideline. It is very disturbing that this phraseology and viewpoint is included (p. 233; lines 49404942).
