When I heard about this I thought it was a joke and literally had to read the information a few times to realize how serious this is. First, the PRO-BDS wording is very scary. While I agree anyone should have the right to boycott anything they like, this movement is anti-Israel, anti-Peace, anti-semetic, etc. The organizers of this movement have specifically called for the ending of the state of Israel. While I do not always agree with everything that the government of Israel does, it is our only democratic ally in the middle east. I also do not agree with everything the US government does. The ethnic studies is hateful, one sided and should be stopped in it's current form. Thank you.
