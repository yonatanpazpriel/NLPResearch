I understand that the committee is reviewing its work based on feedback from multiple Jewish organizations and individuals who are alarmed at the absence of reference to Jews as a marginalized group or reference anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. One wonders how such an omission could have occurred, especially in light of recent attacks here and abroad targeting Jews. The possible answers to that are deeply concerning.
One of the first places in which tolerance for our multicultural society can be inculcated is in the school systems. I am hopeful that your review will address this in a more positive manner than it has so far.
Respectfully, Gail Walden
