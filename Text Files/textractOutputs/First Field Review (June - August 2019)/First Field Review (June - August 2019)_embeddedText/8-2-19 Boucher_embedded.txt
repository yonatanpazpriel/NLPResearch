I am totally opposed to your proposal to denigrate capitalism by calling it racist. Capitalism is what makes America the greatest nation and enables its citizens every opportunity to succeed.
What you are proposing is a morally bankrupt curriculum. I am so disgusted with California's leftist policies.
