From: Jack Forman Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 4:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Hate in the Name of Diversity
Your proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum demonizes the State of Israel and maligns Jews who embrace the State of Israel. It contains highly anti-Israel content, encouraging students to act against Israel while excluding Jewish Americans from its study of minorities in the U.S.
The California Department of Education should scratch the entire document and start from scratch to write a curriculum that brings diverse people together by learning about each other instead of scapegoating American Jews and the State of Israel.
Your proposed curriculum is an embarrassment for the California Dept. of Education. Shame on you...you are supposed to be the adults in the room.
