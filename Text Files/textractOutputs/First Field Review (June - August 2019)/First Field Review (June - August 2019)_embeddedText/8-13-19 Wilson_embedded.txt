As an American Jew, I am deeply concerned about the content of the ethnic studies model curriculum. It institutionalizes hate against the number one target (Jews) of hate crimes in this country. It is unfathomable to me the lack of care shown by its drafters because the proposed model curriculum will no doubt increase and normalize antisemitism among California's young people. History will not look kindly on the decision to implement these disgusting changes. I strongly urge you to reconsider and remove the blatant anti-Jewish and anti-Israel materials from the curriculum.
