I have read the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and the enabling legislation and guidelines. I find that the first draft of the Curriculum goes well beyond the intent of both the legislation and the guidelines.
First of all, the first draft includes modules on gender and radical gender theory. Please explain what connection there is between Ethnic Studies and gender. Please explain how the Department of Education can be considering teaching as fact theories about gender which are highly controversial outside academia and utterly unproven.

Secondly � and this is quite apparent � the curriculum is being used as a vehicle to propagandize for extreme leftist political viewpoints regarding race, economics and identity. This is not education. This is a highly skewed version of reality that will be used to indoctrinate high school children into the way of thinking espoused by progressivist academics and activists.

The entire first draft should be abandoned as a crass attempt to use public schools for political purposes. The intent of the original legislation was to introduce high school children to positive ways to view diversity in our culture, not to shame certain economic systems and ethnicities in order to advance a one-sided poltico-social agenda. The draft is unabashedly bigoted and racist to its core. To introduce this curriculum into the public high schools and make it mandatory for graduation is a form of clear educational fascism. STOP and start over.

Give the citizens - the people and parents of the State of California � a real opportunity to address the mandates of the legislation by offering them an honest, simple, and objective draft curriculum and adequate time to coment methos
