This model curriculum strikes me as a model for indoctrination to a political perspective rather than education. Having only become aware of the draft and having little time to review it, I will only comment on a few specific elements.

What does this mean in simple English "critical praxis of holistic humanity"? page 1 22 Further, it is the xdisciplinary, loving, and critical praxis of holistic humanity � as educational and racial justice

The Ethnic Studies definition seems more politically oriented than anything else. If it is "ethnic studies" why are sexism, classism, homophobia, transphobia included in the definition? Why aren't Jews of Sephardic and Mizrachi descent acknowledged as people of color?

Page 2, Line 27 The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of oppression, including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, that continue to impact the social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political experiences of Native People/s and people of color.

P 20 Bias of curriculum evident Chapter 1 line 496 and following Question: why is the only example of religious accommodation a Muslim example? Why not Christian, Jewish? Hindu? Why not all of these? Why isn't anti-Semitism mentioned? There are growing incidents of anti-Semitism in the state of California. There are no references to Christian, Jew, Hindu in the first chapter of this curriculum. Aren't these omissions examples of bias in the development of this curriculum?

 For example, if an Ethnic Studies educator taught a course with several Muslim students that observed Ramadan, that educator might limit food-based lessons, reduce physical activity, advocate for the creation of an alternative space during lunch, offer additional support to those students, or even create a lesson about Ramadan traditions, Islam, and Islamophobia.

P 2. Bias of curriculum against Israel reinforced in Glossary which targets Israel � the language used is
that of a political group that is opposed to Israel. This is clearly anti-Israeli and anti-Semetic and does not reflect a balanced perspective on terrorism in the region and the responsibility of a country to defend its citizens. Glossary
B
30 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish
freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South
African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and
sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and
organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and
companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities,
and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And
finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for
its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.

P2 Bias of authors against capitalism � don't know what "research" is referred to here, but this glossary is missing definitions of socialism, communism, and includes an interesting phrase "instead of the government". The phrase isn't needed to define capitalism unless the authors are comparing it with another system, which isn't done in the context of this glossary or unless they think that government should control industry and trade.

42 Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified.
