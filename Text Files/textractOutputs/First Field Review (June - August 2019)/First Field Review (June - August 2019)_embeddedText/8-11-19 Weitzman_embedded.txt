From: Dan Weitzman Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: The proposed ESMC
Ms. Soomin Chao Chair Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education
The Honorable Tony Thurmond State Superintendent of Public Instruction
Dear Chairperson Chao and the Honorable Tony Thurmond:
I am writing to join with many other California residents who have expressed very serious concerns with the proposed ESMC, which includes anti-Semitic stereotypes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel .
By way of background, I am a California taxpayer and parent of a young adult who attended public schools. I served as the non-partisan, confidential legal advisor to the California Legislature for more than 35 years (retiring in 2011 as the Chief Deputy of the Legislative Counsel Bureau).
I will not repeat here the numerous errors, omissions, and prejudices that are contained in the proposed curriculum. That has been articulated in detail in many letters and newspaper articles.
I want to express my strong opinion that a few edits will not fix what is wrong with this supposed model for teaching understanding and critical thinking. The current draft demonstrates the need to put safeguards in place for ensuring that the drafters of the model curriculum -- or any other state-mandated curricula -- are prohibited from using the curriculum as a tool for political indoctrination and the promotion of hatred against any race, religion, group or individual.
For that reason, I strongly urge you and any other responsible public official to immediately disband the current Committee membership and establish and convene an entirely new membership using a vetting process that seeks to include individuals committed to ensuring that a new draft is contextually accurate and free from political indoctrination.
Sincerely,
Daniel A. Weitzman
