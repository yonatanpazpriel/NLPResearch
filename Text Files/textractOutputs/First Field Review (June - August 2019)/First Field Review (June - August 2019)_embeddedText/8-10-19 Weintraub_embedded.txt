To Whom It May Concern:
I have read through the Ethnic Studies curriculum and am shocked by the outright bias of much of the content. I am particularly opposed to what is clearly an anti-Jewish and anti-Israel bent as well as how the curriculum seeks to lead students in forming opinions based on the biases inherent in the curriculum itself. How ironic that an area of study devised specifically to shed light on less represented and less understood groups within our culture and to encourage students to think freely and form their own options should in fact do the reverse. What an immense disservice this does both to the integrity of our education system and to encouraging genuine freedom of thought and diversity of beliefs. It is un-American in every conceivable way.
I hope this curriculum will be rewritten or dismantled.
