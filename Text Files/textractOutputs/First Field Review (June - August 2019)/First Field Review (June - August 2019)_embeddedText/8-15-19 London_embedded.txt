I am upset by the way Israel, the tragedy of the 6 million Jews and gypsies slaughtered in world ll.
If you review history you will discover that Jordan was created as an Arab state and Israel as a Jewish state. The neighboring Arab nations refused to admit the Arabs who fled Israel and created the whole Palestinian debacle. Let's be fair and unbiased as we teach our children.
Thank you, Judith london
