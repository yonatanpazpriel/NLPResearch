Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum:
� A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
� The sample lesson plans for the curriculum: � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). � Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). � Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242). � Encourage teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

� The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
ALTHOUGH INCLUSION OF ALL RACES, RELIGIONS AND CULTURE IS A LAUDABLE GOAL FOR ANY ETHNIC STUDIES COURSE, BDS AND ANTI-ISRAEL BIAS HAS NO PLACE IN SUCH A COURSE. THE STATE SHOULD NOT ONLY REMOVE BDS RHETORIC, IT SHOULD GO FURTHER BY ADDING A CHAPTER ON AMERICAN JEWS AS AN ETHNIC GROUP AND THE CONTRIBUTION OF AMERICAN JEWS TO THE CULTURE AND SUCCESS OF THE COUNTRY. IF BIAS IS GOING TO A CENTRAL SUBJECT OF STUDY. THEN ANTI-SEMITISM, PARTICULARLY IN TODAY'S GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT, SHOULD BE ADDRESSED AND IDENTIFIED AS A CORE BIAS THAT HAS EXISTED FOR A MILLENIUM AND IS UNFORTUNATELY RAISING ITS UGLY HEAD AGAIN AROUND THE WORLD.
