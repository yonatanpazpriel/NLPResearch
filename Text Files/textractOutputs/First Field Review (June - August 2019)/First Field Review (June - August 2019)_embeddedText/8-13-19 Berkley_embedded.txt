Page 2, lines 30-40 discusses the BDS movement. It fails to mention this is an anti semitic group whose sole purpose is to destroy Israel and get rid of Jews. Israel is NOT an apartheid state, and if you look at the definition of apartheid, it does not fit. This is, of itself, anti semitic. It is a racist organization which echoes that of Nazi Germany in order to isolate and destroy Jewish business and organizations. This has no place in teaching students and part of a curriculum There is no mention of the Holocaust. This is denying a historical fact of genocide of the Jewish people. This must be taught as part of ethnic studies. To omit this means to erase Jewish and human suffering from history. Page 2 42-47 Capitalism is completely misrepresented in this definition. It is skewed to portray it as a racist entity. When, inf fact, it is the ONLY system that has allowed people who have been disadvantaged to rise up and become successful. There is no other system on the planet which has allowed this. You are completely misrepresenting this. This is clear you have an agenda to destroy the fabric of our country when you teach this tripe.

Page 10 239-240 You mention Islamaphobia, which is fine, however you fail to have Anti-Semitism anywhere on your terms. Jews are more than twice as likely to be victims of racial attacks than Muslims in this country and we are subjugated all over the world. The facet that you have purposefully omitted Anti Semitism is beyond offensive and shows that you are encouraging the hatred of Jews. This is unacceptable Page 10 249 Liberation definition, you mention BDS. Again, this is implying that Israel is evil and Jews are evil. This is bigoted and unacceptable You have completely omitted any mention of Jewish struggle. You have managed to marginalize and dehumanize Jews for the sake of your twisted sense of political correctness. The agenda of this educational board is clear and that is despises Jews and anything Jewish. You have managed to accomplish the same thing that occurred in Nazi Germany by erasing Jewish existence and struggles from history. This is beyond unacceptable and needs to be corrected immediately.
