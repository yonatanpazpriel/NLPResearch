Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As parents and future grandparents of California High School graduates, We are deeply disturbed by the
proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. California high school students deserve an opportunity to learn the role of ethnicity, race and religion in the life of all of its citizens, including especially those previously ignored, but that education must address all ethnic minorities who have been
victimized and targeted, not just selected ones. The Jewish people have been victimized for hundreds of years, and less than 60 years, were targeted and almost annihilated. White supremacists continue to attack Jews this very day. And yet, the current curriculum, not only leave out this history, but actually, as an expression of latent antiSemitism one-sidedly vilifies the one and only tiny Jewish state in the world,
Israel, in in its conflict with the Palestinian Arabs. The intellectual framework of this proposal doesn't belong in public schools. It isn't about the study of ethnic groups, but a political statement masquerading as education. It is about advancing the interests of some ethnic groups over others. Students should be given the tools to think analytically about a number of ideologies instead of learning selectively about history through the narrow lens of only one creed.
We urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Thank you for your reconsideration of this very, very important matter!
