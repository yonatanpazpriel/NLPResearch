From: jan mendelsohn Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 3:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies: Proposed Curriculum
My name is Jan Mendelsohn. I was a teacher in the Oakland Unified School District. I was also a member of the State Democrat Committee and former President (5 years) of the Oakland Education Association. I attended California public schools as a child and young person and graduated from U.C. Berkeley.
I want to raise objections to the Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
I cannot imagine that this proposal does not address Jews as a minority who has suffered from hundreds of years of prejudice. The plight of Jews, especially in World War II, should not be overlooked. Jews were also the target of discrimination in the United States.
It is extremely shameful that parts of the proposal support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) efforts against Israel. Does your proposed curriculum encourage actions against any other country in the world?
California is clearly a multi-ethnic state. Its curriculum must address fairly all ethnic minorities, including Jews. I urge you to change your proposal to reflect the facts about Jews and to play a leadership role for fairness and high educational standards.
