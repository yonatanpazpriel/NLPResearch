From: hal frank Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 12:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Include Jews as a marginalized group in new Ethnic Studies curriculum.
It is wrong not to mention how Jews as a minority have historically been marginalized and also, to not show how the BDS movement against the State of Israel contributes to anti Semitism, affecting Jews worldwide.
The Palestinian people deserve a voice and to protest economically against the oppression they feel by boycotting Israeli products, services and entertainment but a consequence is to marginalize Jews everywhere. Historically such tactics have led to hateful and murderous acts against Jews over and over again. Please be sure to include anti Semitism and its consequences as part of a discussion of ethnicities and how boycotts further it.
