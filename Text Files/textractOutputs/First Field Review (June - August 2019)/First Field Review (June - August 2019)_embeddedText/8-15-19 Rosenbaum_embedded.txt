From: Arlene Rosenbaum Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:58 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please reject the proposed ethnic studies curriculum
As a Californis taxpayer and parent of a California public school graduate I was dismayed to read about the current proposed ethnic studies curriculum for California schools.
I understand that the curriculum omits the American Jewish community in its list of ethnic communities, and includes anti-semitic stereotypes. I also understand that it promotes the antisemitic BDS boycott movement against Israel, the only Jewish majority country in the world and the only liberal democracy in the Middle East. Moreover, I understand that the curriculum contains false information about the 3000 year history of Jews in the Middle East.
At a time when we are seeing a rise in anti-semitism in the US and around the world this attempt to brainwash schoolchildren to have negative feeling toward Jews and Israel is particularly egregious. Advocacy of divisive politics and hateful stereotypes should have no place in the public schools. The content of this curriculum seems to be in complete contradiction to the goals of including ethnic studies in the curriculum in the first place.
I trust that this proposed curriculum will be either seriously overhauled or scrapped, so that the California public schools can be a welcoming place for all students.
Sincerely, Arlene Rosenbaum Rohnert Park CA
