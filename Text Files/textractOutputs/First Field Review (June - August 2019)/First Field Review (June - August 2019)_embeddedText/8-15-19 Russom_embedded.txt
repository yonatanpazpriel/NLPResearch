I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California (referenced on page 1). Since 2001 in particular, Arab Americans have been the targets of racism, Islamophobia, and scapegoating connected with U.S. wars in the Middle East. Yet their history and experience have been virtually invisible in our social studies curriculum. I support the objectives listed on page 233. I agree that teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans is critical for challenging xenonophobia and discrimination and creating a welcoming environment for marginalized students. I think that examining the impact of concepts such as race, Orientalism, Islamophobia, hegemony and Xenophobia is absolutely necessary for an ethnic studies curriculum. It is also critical to show the connection between U.S. imperialism abroad and the treatment of ethnic groups within the U.S � and the Arab-American experience is indispensable in this regard.

Teaching about the Arab American experience of migration (page 236) is vital for creating common understanding among immigrant communities.
(p. 36 of 205) I strongly approve of this development in the way we teach Native American history in California. It not only honestly addresses the genocidal policies that targeted Native Californians, it also fully humanizes indigenous people by highlighting their consistent and ongoing resistance to maintain their lives and cultures.
