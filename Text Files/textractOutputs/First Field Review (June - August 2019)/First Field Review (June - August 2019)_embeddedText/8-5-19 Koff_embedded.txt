This proposal is a thinly-veiled attack on Jews and on Israel. The overall tenor of the language concerning Israel, Palestinians and Jews is inaccurate, incendiary and unfair. It advances conclusions about these peoples that are nothing more than opinions, not facts. For example, the Glossary says " ...Palestinians live under apartheid conditions," which is untrue. BDS is nothing more than Jewhatred and this Proposal seems merely to parrot the ideas and talking points of those who hate Israel and seek its destruction. Why is the State of California lending aid and comfort to such an endeavor? Why even is there a discussion of BDS? BDS promotes divisiveness, hatred of Jews and division. It has no place in a school curricula.

Teachers are encouraged to `highlight BDS,' but nowhere in the Proposal are teachers asked to undertake an unbiased exploration of what BDS is and its negative effects. The Proposal promotes a false equivalency between the situation at the Southern border of the United States and Israel's efforts to stop bombings, shootings and car-ramings in its sovereign territory.

The Proposal promotes a view of Israel's Independence War that is contrafactual; only one perspective is given, and nowhere are teachers encouraged to show students the many facets of this event. A balanced perspective would address American Jewish history and the Holocaust, where people were herded into cattle cars and taken to death camps, where they were gassed and their bodies burnt. Six million Jews, including 2 million children, were murdered in this way during World War II.
