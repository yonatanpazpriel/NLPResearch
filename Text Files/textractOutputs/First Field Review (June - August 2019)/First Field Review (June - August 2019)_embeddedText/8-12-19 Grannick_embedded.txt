I want to voice my opposition to the proposed changes for the school curriculum- specifically, to encourage and "polish" the representation of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement against the sovereign , democratic country of Israel seeking only defend the safety of it's CITIZENs- Jews and non-Jews alike.
I implore you to reconsider and research the BDS movement, discover it's motivations and mission.
Thank you. Debra R. Grannick
