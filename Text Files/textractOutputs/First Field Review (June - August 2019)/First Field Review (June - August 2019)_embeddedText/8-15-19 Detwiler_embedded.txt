This whole course is political propaganda that has no place in schools. THE WHOLE COURSE SHOULD BE BANNED!! The purpose of schools is to promote logical reasoning, not create social activists who are out of touch with reality. In addition, there are multiple egregiously politically one-sided statements in this document. You should have this document reviewed by multiple staunch conservatives. You should strike out anything they indicate is objectionable. You should change the tone and the details to be inclusive of everyone, not just people of color. Otherwise you will create resentment that will backfire to your cause.
