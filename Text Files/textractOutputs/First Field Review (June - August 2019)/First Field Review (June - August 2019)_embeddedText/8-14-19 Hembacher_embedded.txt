From: Diane Hembacher [mailto:diane.hemb@gmail.com] Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: Ethnic Studies Curricula
I am writing to comment on the proposed ethnic studies curricula. As a lifelong educator devoted to the pursuit of social justice, I strongly support Linda Darling-Hammond's rationale for ethnic studies. However, I am deeply troubled by the omission of the Jewish experience in the proposed curricula, as well as the failure to address antiSemitism. I concur with the concerns raised in the letter written by the Jewish Caucus of the California State Legislature. I look forward to reading a revised draft of the curricula.
Thank you for the opportunity to comment.
