From: stuart oremland Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 7:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Tony Thurmond Subject: The deeply flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum,
Dear Sirs
I am writing to you as an American and California citizen.
I am very strongly offended, hurt and outraged by the proposed draft of the terribly flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
I am Jewish and I am keenly aware that half of all religious hate crimes in the USA are against Jews. I have keen memories of relatives with the Nazi concentration camp numbers tattooed on their arms.
Hard to believe that a curriculum that would purport to help make people more tolerant of others, would "conveniently" leave out Jews as a minority group- and leave out the group subject to 50% of religious hate crimes.
I also see that the so called "BDS" movement - which at its core -wants to delegitimize the existence of Israel is only presented with a one sided view. Is there any discussion of delegitimizing the existence of the 57 Muslim majority nations despite their relatively poor record in relation to:
women's rights? gay rights?

freedom of religion? freedom of the press democratic voting?
or are those values not important in California?
If you are interested in protecting minorities, will the curriculum just attack the existence of Israel? -or perhaps will there be a word about how the Islamic world treats, Kurds? Coptic Christians? Yazidis? Druze? Assyrians? Baluchis? Armenians? Or don't those minorities count?
This staggeringly anti Jewish, anti Semitic curriculum does no service to California nor America. In fact, presenting this type of biased, one sided view of a people and history, merely serves to make the words "racist"and "hate" meaningless- and in effect, renders the original goal- null and void.
I hope this curriculum is voided and a balanced one replaces it.
Thank you very much
Stuart Oremland Portola Valley, CA
