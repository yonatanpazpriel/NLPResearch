As a member of CUFI (Christians United for Israel), it is staggering that your committee could be so blazingly ignorant about the situation in Israel with its "neighbors". The BDS movement is the front for the stated purpose of annihilating one of the most productive and humane countries on the planet. Arab citizens of Israel have more rights by far than any non-Muslim citizens of any Muslim country. Are you unaware of the growing "no-go zones" in major European cities in Europe, where assimilation into Western culture is nonexistent? Why would you want to propagate this agenda??? Why would you want to poison the minds of our innocent children??
With the rising tide of anti-Semitism around the world, it would be so much more appropriate to address this actual, very real problem.
