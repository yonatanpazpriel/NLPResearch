Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
As an educator and Jew and resident of San Mateo CA, I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
While I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, in fact I believe that culturally responsive curriculum and ethnic studies are crucial, I ask that you to make revisions to Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter and others.
Especially given the recent rise in hostilities towards ethnic minorities -- and particularly towards Jews (see the recent shootings in Pittsburgh and in Southern California) -- it would be a shame to exclude a thorough discussion of antisemitism, and to reinforce negative stereotypes about Jews. This is a curriculum that will be adopted by the state and be in place for years to come -- not to mention the national impact as other states often follow the lead of California.
Please consider addressing these changes in a rewrite of the Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Ben Politzer
