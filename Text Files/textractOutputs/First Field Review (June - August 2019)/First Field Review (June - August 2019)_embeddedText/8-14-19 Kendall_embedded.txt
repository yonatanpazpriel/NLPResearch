As a former teacher, current businessperson, father of three, and CA resident, I am appalled by this curriculum. I have sent it to my entire network, representing a wide spectrum of political affiliation. To a one, they have responded with equal outrage. I'm sure my comments will be brushed off as part of an expected pushback from the androcentric, cisheteropatriarchy, but so be it. I am glad to see that Microsoft word auto correct does not yet recognize most of the new terms in your glossary.
I'm all for social change, but to me, this does not look like it at all. It reads as best like a parody and at worst like extreme leftist jargon. It is the exact kind of rhetoric you hear from left-wing populists seizing control of power with total moral purity in the name of some obscure idea of justice.
I question the social change the authors think this will bring about. Finally teaching kids that capitalism is the source of most oppression in the world? That absolutely all forms of inequities in our society are rooted in systemic racism and sexism? That our history needs to be re-written from the perspective of only the marginalized (and by the way, you forgot my kids who are Jewish through their mother. But the extreme left wants to carve them out of the conversation. Is it because of Israel or their supposed financial success that they do not make the cut? What about poor, rural white men who are suffering disproportionally from the Opioid epidemic?).
From someone who taught in the South Bronx and who supports charter schools like KIPP and Aspire, the biggest social injustice is an education system that allows kids to graduate high school at a 4th grade reading and math level. When I read words like the following from the guidelines, I fear that we are throwing all of our academic standards out the window because they were created by the Eurocentric, cisheteropatriarchy and therefore must be undone.
Students are asked to "achieve academic success" in a humanizing and critically conscious way, while demanding the education system reconsider what constitutes the parameters of academic success. Ethnic Studies has created a space for all students to learn about and analyze their identities and hxrstories, feel proud of them, and actualize their full humanity.
To me, this is not social change at all. It's social injustice by not serving the needs of our most disenfranchised, while trying to brainwash everyone to become leftist social activists. My kids will be fine because I can afford private schools. It's the kids in public schools that will have this
