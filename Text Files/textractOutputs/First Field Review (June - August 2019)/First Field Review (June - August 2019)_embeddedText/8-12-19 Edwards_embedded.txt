Dear sir or madam,
Attached please find my response to the CDE's proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am deeply troubled by this proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum, which not only fails to include anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry, but blatantly promotes boycotts against Israel. The omission of Jews as targets of hatred and racism in this curriculum is simply unfathomable to me.
I respectfully urge you most strongly to reconsider the contents of this proposed curriculum, and to make changes accordingly.
Thank you very kindly for your attention to this urgent matter.
Sincerely,
Valerie Edwards
