From: Clara Mikowski Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 8:36 AM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am an MEd graduate from Tufts University, who has spent 35 years educating children and adults. I oppose the high school curriculum that you are considering that takes the complex problems of the Middle East and frames them in a way that demonizes one side and makes the other side the underdog. The issues facing the Jews and Arabs in Israel are much more complex than you include in this curriculum. I caution you to not lead students down a path that leads to hatred for one side or the other. You are in delicate territory when it comes to this subject. Like any other political and social curricula, yours must not lead to more divisions in an already incendiary environment. Please reconsider your stances on BDS and the struggle for survival of both peoples. California schools are a model of enlightened education. Do not take a side without balance or it will lead to more anti attitudes instead of positive solutions in the future. Thank you for your careful consideration, Clara Mikowski
