From: Laura Madrid Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Against this agenda
I respectfully ask you to not mandate this in our schools. I have many grandchildren who are school age and we will pull them from the public school system if this passes. Capitalism is not a form of racism and this is what our country was and should be all about.
Teaching antisemitism is wrong! I'm fed up with California and will move to a different state. We are saddened and sickened by the way California is running and is headed. Enough already! From a Mexican American/ Native American woman!
Thank you, Laura and family
