Page 1: I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings

Page 233: I support the objectives listed, which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.

Page 236: Including a history of migration to the US is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
