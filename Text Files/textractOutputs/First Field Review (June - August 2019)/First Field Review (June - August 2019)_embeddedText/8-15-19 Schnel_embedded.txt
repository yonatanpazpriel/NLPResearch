I am beyond stunned by the lack of balance within the sample curriculum for the new Ethnic Studies program. The lack of detail regarding AntiSemitism in the United States is such a substantial void, it's shocking. Talk about not seeing the forest through the trees! This is even more blatant when things like Boycott, Divest, and Sanction are provided discussion in the draft curriculum. Our Jewish community's collective experience as American Jews, inclusive of my own (unfortunate) experience of Anti-Semitism within the California public-school system I attended, is something that needs highlighting in a fair and unbiased way. Directly connected to the Anti-Semitic issues not addressed is also a depiction of Israel that is unfair and hateful. This is totally unacceptable.
