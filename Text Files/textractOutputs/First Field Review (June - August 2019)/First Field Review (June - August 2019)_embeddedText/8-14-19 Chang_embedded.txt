Page 7 Line #244 � Korean immigrant labor and settlement not included at all. This is very troubling and must include Korean immigration as part of California history Page 14, Line 501 � Korean Americans not included. In the aftermath of Los Angeles civil unrest of 1992, Korean American merchants suffered "triple oppression" (economic, psychological, and media distortion). Korean Americans have emerged as one of the most visible and important group in California in terms of race relations and multiracial coalition building Page 21, Line 806-808 � Again Korean Americans are not represented.
