Beti An Hynes General I do not think this subject is appropriate for public schools. I'm shocked that you are not improving basic education, including humanities. It would be refreshing to meet high school graduates that actually read and write. Rather than improving the existing system you are supporting college for all rather than trade schools. It appears that we need fee education through JC just for our youth to achieve a 12th grade level.
