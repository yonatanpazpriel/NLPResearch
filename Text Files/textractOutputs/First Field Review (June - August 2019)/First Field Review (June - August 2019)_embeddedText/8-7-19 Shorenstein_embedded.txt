Dear California Education Members: My family and I strongly oppose this ethnic studies model curriculum because it includes antisemitic and antiIsrael content. This is inexcusable and should not be promulgated in publicly funded schools. We who are Jews have always been a minority, and our civil rights, supposedly guaranteed by the US Constitution and Title VI federal legislation, have been violated on puic and private campuses because the laws are not enforced and because teachers are permitted to preach their antisemitic views. This should not be enshrined in educational policy. Please revise the ethnic studies model curriculum to follow modern guidelines against antisemitism, which include propaganda against Israel's right to exist. Thank you. Rosalind Shorenstein, M.D. Ph.D., FACP
