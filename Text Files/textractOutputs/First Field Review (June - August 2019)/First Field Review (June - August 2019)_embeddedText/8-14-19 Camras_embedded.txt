An ethnic studies curriculum that includes an entity governed by terrorists and a curriculum that discriminates against Jews by not including them and derides the Jewish state, which is the only a democracy in the middle east makes me conclude that the folks putting together your ethnic studies curriculum are antiSemites and racists. Comparisons between Palestinians and African Americans can only be made by people who don't know history, or would choose to focus on African Americans who committed terrorist acts in the US. The fact that you consider lumping together Mexico with Palestine for border studies is absurd. If you do support terrorists and terrorist entities, than give equal time to Iranians, Syrians, and Lebanese terrorist organizations so you can really capture how much you don't value human life and human ideals. If your goal is to create more generations of people who hate Jews, than acknowledge that is what your curriculum intends to do. DISGRACEFUL
