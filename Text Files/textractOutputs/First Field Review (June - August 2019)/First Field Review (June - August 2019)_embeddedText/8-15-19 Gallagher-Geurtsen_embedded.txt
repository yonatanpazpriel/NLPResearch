Page 23, line 560 "Guidance and Support" Might it be helpful to include support for teacher awareness of privilege and ability to recognize both individual and institutional racism, sexism etc. as required for teaching ES as introduced on page 21?
Overall, I find the introductory chapter well-written with essential content. However, I wonder if there is a way to reduce some repetition, include more organizational headings, and crystalize it in order to make it shorter and easier to use? For example, framing the entire chapter around key essential questions and big ideas (utilizing Understanidng by Design) would strengthen it.

Page 1, line 22. I think given the concerns about minoritized groups that do not fall into the traditional 4 groups, it would be important to underscore and perhaps bring this statement/recommendation to chapter 1?: "More importantly, it can serve as a
model for other communities of color who do not see their unique experiences represented in current course offerings and may have an interest in developing their own course."
I assume a table to contents will be included in a later draft for each sample lesson/unit?
The variety of units and ethnic groups studied is excellent. The units are written in a teacher-friendly way are engaging, and well-scaffolded for a variety of learners with diverse needs in most cases.
