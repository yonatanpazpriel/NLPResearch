I am deeply saddened and appalled that the state of California would even consider this new curriculum. In a time where anti Semitism is on the rise in this country and we are constantly preaching inclusion to our children you're proposing teaching kids hate and lies. Implementing ethnic studies for our children should be an opportunity to teach them inclusion and understanding of minority groups and inclusion. What you are doing would do the opposite. It would cause hatred and problems in our schools. You would be giving our children misinformation about Israel and it's history. And by including subjects such as the bds movement you'd further help in their cause to wipe Israel of the map and implement hatred and problems for our students.
As a parent, a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division.
Thank you
