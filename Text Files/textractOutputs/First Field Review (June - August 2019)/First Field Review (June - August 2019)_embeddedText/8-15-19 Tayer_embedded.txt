Brief Comments on California Ethnic Studies Curriculum Proposal
I think it is an excellent idea to include an updated curriculum for Ethnic Studies courses for California public high school students. Please consider the following comments:
1. With anti-Semitism on the rise (again) in the United States (and in Europe), it's crucial to stay as factual and as unbiased as possible. If the Ethnic Studies courses do not adhere to this basic principle, the antiSemitic, hate-crime epidemic will get even worse, and the Ethnic Studies course could be, in part, to blame.
2. Along these lines, it's critical to mention the context of key historical events, especially the United Nations plan to partition the British Mandate territory, formerly known as Palestine, into two states in the aftermath of World War II and Hitler's genocide of 6 million Jews. As the last of the Jewish survivors of the Holocaust are now dying, there is an increased denial among ignorant and/or anti-Semitic people in the US and around the world that the Holocaust actually occurred, or that roughly 6 million Jews were killed in a horrible genocide. If the California Ethnic Studies course does not put the Palestinian situation in this factual and historic context, it risks playing into anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial, and exacerbating the situation for both Jews and Arabs.
The UN's two-state plan was adopted in 1947 by the UN as Resolution 181. But the Palestinians, along with the surrounding Arab states, rejected the formation of a Palestinian Arab State. And when Israel created its UN-approved state in 1948, the Arabs declared war on Israel, intending to annihilate the new state. The discussion of "Nakba" (page 242, line 5159) must be in the context of these historical facts.
The Palestinians deserve to have their own country. They deserved it in 1948 and they deserve it now. But no legitimate academic course can ignore the fact that the Palestinians have had several opportunities for their own state, starting in 1948, and each time their leadership failed them.
3. The use of the term "Israel/Palestine" (page 237, line 5030) and "Palestine/Israel" (page 241, line 5138) is historically inaccurate, if not anti-Semitic. As discussed above, Israel became a legitimate state per UN plan and majority vote (in 1948). In contrast, while the Palestinians deserve to have a state, as part of a two-state solution, they haven't been able to get there, first and foremost due to their leadership's refusal to recognize Israel's right to exist. Therefore, it's correct to refer to terms such as "Israel," "the West Bank," and even "Occupied Territories resulting from the 1967 Six-Day War." But it's extremely

misleading and inaccurate to refer to "Israel/Palestine" or "Palestine/Israel."
4. You may want to reference the book "My Promised Land" by Ari Shavit. In my opinion, it's the best book ever written about the whole situation of Israel and the Palestinians as it explains both sides in a factual and unbiased manner. Everyone in the world should read this book before forming their own opinions.
