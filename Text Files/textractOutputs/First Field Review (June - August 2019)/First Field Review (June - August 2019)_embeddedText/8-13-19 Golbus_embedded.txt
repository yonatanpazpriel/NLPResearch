I object in the strongest possible terms to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum as it relates to the contributions of the Jewish community in California, omission of any meaningful mention of antisimitism the status of the State of Israel and the inaccurate depiction of the so-called BDS movement. I incorporate the terms in the Jewish Caucus Letter on the subject and make the following general comments: Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. � This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. � The ESMC omits antisemitism. � This is also inconsistent with, and in contrast to, the attention it devotes to Islamophobia. The most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents. � The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. � The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement.

Introduction Jennifer Golbus CA Resident

The introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disturbing.is

The ESMC Glossary for this course includes, under the letter B, an inaccurate description of BDS. But antisemitism is missing from the Glossary.

Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.

Within the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC"), line 4955 provides a list of recommended topics for students to investigate: Anti-Arab and Muslim Violence Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico

The facts the ESMC omits are as follows: The Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel is an antisemitic movement that has as its the goal eradicating the State of Israel. Its founders, including Omar Barghouti, have admitted as much. Germany has recognized BDS as antisemitic. The United States Congress has passed repeated resolutions condemning BDS. The most recent in July 2019 received overwhelming bipartisan support, and passed 398-17. Numerous state legislatures have passed laws that prohibit state agencies from doing business with any firm that supports BDS. California Assembly Bill 2844 was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown on September 24, 2016. The law requires those who enter into contracts with state agencies to certify that they are not involved in activities that violate the Unruh Civil Rights Act, including support for the BDS movement and its programs.

The ESMC, at line 5157-5163, adopts the "Nakba" narrative: The largest single group [of Arab immigrants to the US] was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.

The Facts: This section introduces historical events without providing any factual substance. The following are facts students need to know in order to have a basic understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current Palestinian predicament: What happened in 1947-48 that led to the Palestinian Arab dispersal? 1) No state of Palestine existed. Two states were proposed � a Jewish one and an Arab one in UN Resolution 181. The resolution was accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. Arab armies invaded with the stated goal of eradicating the Jewish state. Resolution 242, passed after the 1967 war, forms the basis of a peaceful solution. 2) Most Palestinian Arabs who fled expected to return after the Jews had been defeated. Forcible removal of Arabs by Jewish armed groups was responsible for only a small portion of Palestinian Arab flight. For more, see Palestine Betrayed by Efraim Karsh and The Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Palestine War 1948 also by Efraim Karsh. 3) The Jews are indigenous people of the territory called Palestine. For much of its history it was known as Israel or Judea. The Jewish presence goes back several thousand years. The Arabs arrived as conquerors in the 7th century.

4) The Palestine Mandate was a creation of the League of Nations and administered by Britain. It included what is now Jordan in 78% of the total land area. 5) The leading Palestinian political figure of the first half of the 20th century was Haj Amin Husseini. He incited violence against Jews and Arabs who sought a peaceful compromise and he collaborated with the Nazis. After World War II ended, he returned to the Middle East and organized a campaign of violence against Jews. See The Mufti of Jerusalem: Haj-Amin el-Husseini and NationalSocialism by Jenny Lebel. 6) Fatah (1959) and the PLO (1964) were created before Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza (1967). Their goal was to erase Israel. The Fatah General Congress in 2010 reaffirmed its commitment to violence and dismantling the Jewish state. 7) The chief obstacle to moving forward with a peaceful resolution is incitement and indoctrination to reject Israel and vilify Jews that is rampant in Palestinian media, schools, mosques and official messages to the public. Organizations like MEMRI and Palestinian Media Watch have documented on-going incitement to violence and hatred.

Line 6008 of the ESMC promotes the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) as a reliable source of information. The Facts: CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land terrorist financing trial. It has been labeled a terrorist group by the United Arab Emirates. CAIR has been ousted from the San Diego public schools for promoting Islam.

The Facts:
FBI figures show much greater prevalence of antisemitism and violence directed against Jews.
There is no evidence of legal discrimination against Muslims in the United States.
On college campuses, including in California, Jews, especially those who support Israel, are subject to the most extensive harassment.
In our middle schools, including where I live in San Rafael, CA, anti-semitism is on the rise, with children experiences hateful anti-semitic speech, swatstikas carved into desks and drawn on backpacks and lockers, and more.

ESMC Lines 5792 and 5820 include a lengthy rap song that calls for "Free Palestine."
The lyrics include the following statement: "The child (divine) Mary doesn't want your punishment, she is going to free the Palestinian soil."
I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
I am disheartened to see that this proposed curriculum does not include Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. Our public educational system must offer a a balanced curriculum to protect against anti-semitism. I urge you to include more context and

facts when discussing these topics, and to refrain from presenting propaganda from the BDS movement as fact in our school curriculum.
With two children about to enter high school in a year, I am personally affected by this. I cannot subject my children to a curriculum that is using what I consider to be propaganda as facts, and does not present a balanced view of a complex topic. If this curriculum is adopted as currently drafted, I'll be left with no choice but to remove my children from the CA public school system and urge others to do the same.
