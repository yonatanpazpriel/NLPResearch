Dear CRIFD Personnel:
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for anti-Semitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others -- including the Jewish Public Affairs Committee in California -- in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, are not created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
As a taxpayer, consumer of California's public education system, and a student who experienced significant anti-Semitism in California's public school environment with no satisfactory results by school administrators, I fear you are heading down a dangerous path of institutionalizing racial hatred in our schools. With a significant rise in anti-Semitism in our communities, places of worship, on college campuses, and now the possibility that a blatantly biased curriculum could be part of every public high school in California, it is incumbent upon me to express my opposition to this proposed and biased curriculum.
California can and must do better.
Thank you, Kate Provance
