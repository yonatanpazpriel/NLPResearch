Line 30 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions � see above; should not be a part of this course.
"Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" � incorrect; there is no apartheid in Israel.
The document singles out Israel � Palestine conflict � which is not a part of the American history at all. This complex conflict is described from one side only, without offering a different perspective.
The curriculum does not feature any lessons on Jewish community,
Antisemitism is not discussed in the curriculum despite its alarming growing rate and its prevalence among religion-based hate crimes. Not talking about the Jewish community, not talking about antiSemitism, singling out Israel-Palestine conflict and describing it from one-side only, and promoting BDS, this curriculum does not achieve its stated goal of "enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion"
