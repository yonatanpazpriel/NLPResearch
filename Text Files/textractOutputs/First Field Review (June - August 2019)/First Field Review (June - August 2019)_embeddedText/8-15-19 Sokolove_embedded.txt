On page 3 of the Introduction and Overview, pp. 59-62, the document states the following: "Beyond providing a h[i]story and analysis of oppression and power, Ethnic Studies offers a dynamic inquiry-based approach to the study of Native People/s and communities of color that encourages utilizing transnational and comparative frameworks."
The restriction of the program to "Native Peoples and communities of color" is both misleading and unwarranted. Possibly it was unintentional that ethnic minorities in the U.S. (such as the Jewish people, Serbian people, Greek orthodox people, Armenian people, etc.) were excluded from the proposed Model Curriculum. If such ethnic groups were deliberately excluded, however, then that represents a very biased and completely unwarranted action indicative of significant and deep-seated prejudice.
Harris Chaiklin in his article for Scholastic (www.scholastic.com/teachers/articles/teachingcontent/ethnic-minorities/) defines ethnic minorities as "people who differ in race or color or in national, religious, or cultural origin from the dominant group -- often the majority population -- of the country in which they live [emphasis added]." Chaiklin goes on to note that "Characteristically the minority is recognized, but it is not necessarily accepted by the larger society in which its members live."
The Jewish community is a numerical minority in the US and it has repeatedly endured periods of extreme antisemitism (including, in recent years, a significant increase in the frequency of antisemitic acts by neo-Nazis and white supremacists). In other words, the Jewish people in the US fits the definition of an ethnic minority. The fact that the intellectual, scientific and economic contributions that Jews as well as other ethnic minorities have made to the US are being excluded from this "model curriculum" is neither right nor morally defensible.
Given that title of the "model curriculum "includes the words "Ethnic Studies," the curriculum itself must include more "ethnic minorities" than simply "native peoples and communities of color" (as for example, "native peoples, communities of color, and other ethnic minorities such as Jews, Serbs and Armenians"). To do otherwise would be so inconsistent with the current title that a new title for the proposed curriculum should immediately be selected that does not give the misleading and inaccurate impression that the present, limited curriculum is about "Ethnic Studies" generally. It clearly is not.
