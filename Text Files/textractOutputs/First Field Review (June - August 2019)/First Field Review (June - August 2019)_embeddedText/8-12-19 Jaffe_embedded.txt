1. The draft curriculum omits any discussion of antisemitism and the discrimination and hate directed at Jewish Americans in the past and present, exemplified in the recent surge of documented violent antisemitic incidents.
2. The draft curriculum discusses the displacement of Palestinians without providing the context and facts associated with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It refers to "the Nakba" but never mentions the Holocaust or the need for a Jewish state, nor does it discuss the violence preceding the Israeli War of Independence, which continues to this day.
3. The draft curriculum condemns Israel and justifies the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement not a civil rights movement: "When people talk about the goals of the BDS movement, they don't bother to read official statements from its leaders ... If you do, it becomes clear that the goals of its leaders are the same as those of the leaders of Palestinian terror organizations. BDS rejects Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state within any borders. They want to see Israel wiped off the map."
Be very assured that if these issues are not addressed in the final draft, any school district that attempts to implement the guidelines will face lawsuits, as may your department.
