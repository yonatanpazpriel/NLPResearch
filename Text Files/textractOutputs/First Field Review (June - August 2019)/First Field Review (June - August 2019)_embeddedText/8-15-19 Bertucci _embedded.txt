Has the California Department of Education really decided that students should be taught that capitalism is racist? And to compare it to white supremacy? That's not only outrageous, it's sickening!
How many of California students have come here to escape social injustice, hopelessness, violence, and lack of economic opportunity caused by socialism and communism...and are here to make their lives better through capitalism?
If you truly believe that capitalism is evil, I challenge you to lead by example: decline any pay for yourselves. Then ask all public school educators to work for no salary. How many volunteers do you think you'll get...especially from all those who threaten to strike every few years if they aren't given a salary raise?
I hope you'll reconsider your approach. Thank you.
