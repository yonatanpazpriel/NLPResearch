I am deeply troubled by the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The proposed curriculum is the result of a 2016 law calling for the creation of a model ethnicstudies curriculum by our California Board of Education. As part of a resolution currently moving through the California legislature, AB-331, all California high school students will be required to take at least one course in ethnic studies to graduate. The proposed curriculum is anti-Semitic and anti-Israel. Safeguards must be put in place to ensure that the drafters of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum(ESMC) will not be permitted to use the model curriculum to promote political, ethnic or religious enmity towards any groups, including Jewish people, or to weaponize high school students to take action based on such enmity. I fear that this particular model curriculum, if adopted by the Instructional Quality Commission, will have an enormously negative impact on the state's high schools, colleges and universities for years to come. Please immediately address this consequential problem by establishing safeguards and ensuring that all state-sponsored curricula and other instructional materials may never be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual. Last week, the Jewish News Syndicate (JNS) exposed this proposed ethnic-studies curriculum. The article noted in detail that AMCHA Initiative Director Tammi RossmanBenjamin told Jewish News Syndicate, "The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is deeply troubling ï¿½ not only for its shocking omission of any mention of Jewish Americans or anti-Semitism or its blatant anti-Israel bias and praise of BDS, but for its clear attempt to politically indoctrinate students to adopt the view that Israel and its Jewish supporters are part of `interlocking systems of oppression and privilege' that must be fought with `direct action' and `resistance.'" Sixteen members of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and dozens of organizations, including AMCHA, JCRC, ADL, the Simon Wiesenthal Center, StandWithUs, AJC, AEN, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East and Club Z, have raised alarms over the proposed curriculum. As noted in the JNS article, 25% of the Model Curriculum Advisory Committee tasked with developing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is made up of academics who have publicly aired their antiIsrael views and bias. "There is no doubt that these committee members have unconscionably used the state-mandated curriculum as a tool for politically indoctrinating California's high school students with anti-Israel propaganda and encouraging them to engage in political activism against the Jewish state," According to Nicole Rosen, "Considerable evidence indicates that campuses with antiZionist expression and activity, including the promotion of BDS, are three times more likely to host incidents targeting Jewish students for harm, including acts of harassment, vandalism and assault. Implementation of a model curriculum that includes the promulgation of such political, ethnic or religious hatred can't help but threaten the safety and wellbeing of Jewish and pro-Israel high school students in the state," and will
