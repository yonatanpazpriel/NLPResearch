Your introduction notes that the curriculum will relate to "d) our world � past present, and future." The American Jewish experience is an important ethnic experience in our country, and has been since it was founded on principles including religious freedom. Despite California's being one of a handful of states to require Holocaust education, an ethnic studies model curriculum that does not include antisemitism is one that misleads and effectively erases the American Jewish experience, reflecting an anti-Jewish bias. Your introduction notes that the curriculum will relate to "d) our world � past present, and future." While Jews may not be considered natice peoples or people of color, they are often treated with the same idea of "otherness" from the white normative culture as these peoples. The American Jewish experience is an important ethnic experience in our country, and has been since it was founded on principles including religious freedom. It should be included in any Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
