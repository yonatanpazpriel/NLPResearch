From: Michele Klein (JR) Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:00 PM To: Superintendent Cc: Glenn Daniel Subject: Request CA Board of Education to review the ESMC for bias
Dear California Board of Education,
As Californians and graduates of public grade and high schools and state universities, Glenn and I are distressed that you would consider the new Ethnic Studies Model Draft Curriculum (ESMC) as written.
If the goal was to build shared understanding of ethnic and minority students and alleviate prejudice and bigotry, it fails. Rather the ESMC institutionalizes anti-Semitic thoughts and stereotypes--at a time of rising antisemitism. In 2018, the FBI reports there were 3x more hate crimes in the US against Jews than against Muslims.
We witness antisemitism right here in California. Some public school students are advised not to wear Jewish religious symbols to avoid being teased or ostracized. Attendance at Jewish religious services has declined due to concerns about attacks on synagogues, as we saw recently in Poway.
While significant sections of the ESMC focus on Islamophobia, Blacks, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders and other minority groups, there is virtually no mention of Jews. This concerns me as an American, especially since California is a thought leader, and our legislation is often copied by other states.
As written, the "template" is biased:
� It excludes anti-Semitism from hate crimes/discrimination, while half the religious hate crimes in the US target Jews.
� It includes the BDS (Boycott Divest Sanction) political movement which is anti-Israel, and of little relevance to minority inclusion in California.
� It does not acknowledge Judaism as a minority in America, and a historically oppressed group in the world. Indeed such oppression led most American Jews or their ancestors to emigrate here.
� It presents pro-Palestinian code and slanted terms about Israel, the only Jewish majority country in the world, omitting balanced criticism of the two dozen Arab countries with a long history of antisemitism and exterminating and expelling Jews.
The Committee has been highjacked. We ask that the Board of Education and elected officials provide oversight and correct this dismally flawed ESMC. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Michele Klein Glenn Daniel Portola Valley, CA
