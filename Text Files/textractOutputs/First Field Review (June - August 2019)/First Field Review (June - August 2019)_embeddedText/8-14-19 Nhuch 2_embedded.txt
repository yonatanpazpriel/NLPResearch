CDE's "History-Social Science Content Standards for California Public Schools" require students to "understand how the forces of nationalism developed in the Middle East, how the Holocaust affected world opinion regarding the need for a Jewish state, and the significance and effects of the location and establishment of Israel on world affairs."
This part does not comply with the Content Standards on the Middle East and so needs to be revised:
Suggested correction: We call for the removal of the call to Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel. Omar Baghrouti the founder of the BDS movement is a Palestinian who lives in Israel with every right as a citizen. He received a masters at the University of Tel Aviv in philosophy and is now pursuing his PHD. And yet he calls Israel an Apartheid State. He is against a two state solution, which the goal is the end of Israel as a Jewish state. "From the river to the see Palestine will be free" is his chant. This chant is the most pervasive and demonic chant since the Nazis. It calls not only for the destruction of a country, but also getting rid of the people living in it. The hypocrisy of the BDS is that Baghrouti calls for the boycott, divestment and sanctions but he has no problem using for his own advancement, all that Israel has to give.
If you want to teach about BDS it should be not an emotional or political driven class, but showing how a movement was created with the goal of the destruction of a whole people.

Suggested correction:
In 1944 before a U. S. House committee, Philip Hitti gave testimony in support of the view that there was no historical justification for a Jewish homeland in Palestine. His testimony was reprinted in the Princeton Herald.

Suggested correction: Said advocated the right of return to all Palestinians, but one can't mention the displacement of the Palestinians without mentioning the displacement and expulsion of over 800.000 Jews form Arab lands from 1948 onward, when all Jewish properties were confiscated.

Suggested correction: � Kemal Amin "Casey" Kasem- It's important to stress when mentioning Mr. Kasem's opposition to Israel's invasion of Lebanon, that the Christian government of Lebanon was being overthrown by the PLO, led by Yasser Arafat, the same way he tried to overthrow the Kingdom of Jordan in 1974.

Suggested correction: Linda Sarsour masks herself as a defender of women's rights when in fact she is a defender of Sharia Law. A woman who truly defends women's rights would never tweet at Ayan Hirsi Ali, who has suffered genital mutilation under the Sharia Law. Her tweet: "Brigitte Gabriel = Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She's asking 4 an a$$ whippin'. I wish I could take their vaginas away- they don't deserve to be women," 2011. The motivation behind the tweet was Hirsi Ali's equating Sharia Law to the Islamic State. Linda Sarsour is an anti-Semite who blamed the Jews for the slave trade. She has blamed Jews for oppressing brown and black people, when in fact more the half of the Jewish population in the world, who comprise only 13 million, is brown and black deriving from North Africa and the Middle East. Linda Sarsour associates with and supports Louis Farrakhan who is a virulent anti semite, and she made a statement that Jesus was a Palestinian. In the social media environment that our kids live in, Linda Sarsour is trying to rewrite history according to Linda Sarsour.

Suggested correction: When mentioning Rashida Harbi Tlaiib is important to stress that she doesn't stand for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. She promotes the BDS movement and a one state solution, which would eliminate Israel as the only Jewish state in the world. There are 50 Muslim majority countries, but only 1 Jewish majority state. Also important to mention the persecution of Christians in the majority Muslim countries. Jews are not persecuted in Lybia, Yemen or Sudan, for instance, simply because there are none to be found.
