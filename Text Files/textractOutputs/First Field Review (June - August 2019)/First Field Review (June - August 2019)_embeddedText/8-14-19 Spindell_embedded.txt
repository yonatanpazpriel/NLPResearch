Initial attempt to use the downloaded template was rejected; therefore, I am proceeding with a reasonable approximation. Insisting on your specific template appears to be a rather deliberate hurdle aimed at reducing negative responses.

Column 2: Arline Spindell and William Spindell
Commentary: This a major objection to, not only your deliberate exclusion of Jews but to your apparent acceptance of labeling Israel as a colonial oppressor. It is a thinly veiled blatant expression of Anti-Semitism, despite protestations to the contrary. Are you concentrating on minorities or not? Statistically, Jews comprise approximately 3% of the population. Are you using the term "studies" objectively or subjectively? You might teach some real Jewish history which, like it or not, goes back to the original diaspora..dispersed from what is now Israel, and pre-dates the existence of both Christianity and Islam. Additionally, if you are going to accept a criticism of taking over land and displacing the residents thereof, you might add several long chapters of our country, if not the continent. Check with indigenous peoples who were pushed out (and many murdered in the process) and relegated to reservations.
Be aware that isolating Jews under some form of government approval has, in the not too distant past, provided a seed in Europe from which poisonous trees grew.
The general concept is good but clearly selective.
