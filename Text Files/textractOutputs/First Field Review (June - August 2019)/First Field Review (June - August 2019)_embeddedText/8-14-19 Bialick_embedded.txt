From: Barry Bialick Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum - General Comment
Dear Commission Members:
I respectfully ask you not to adopt the current proposed revision of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum in its current form. Unfortunately, though intended to highlight the diversity of people, it also includes the politics of Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement against Israel. This is not the place for politics. Let us not obfuscate the message you are trying to send by bringing in politics of any kind to a curriculum focused on diversity.
Thank you.
Barry E. Bialick
