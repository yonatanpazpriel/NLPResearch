From: Nelly Bulkin Sent: Saturday, August 3, 2019 2:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: NO on new ethnic studies curriculum
I am horrified that my home state is considering a new ethnic studies curriculum that omits anti semitism as a form of bigotry. Israel is the ONLY democratic and progressive country in the middle east and I am highly opposed to a curriculum that vilifies it.
Please represent both sides. Remember facts. Take a hard look at oppression of women and homosexuals all over the world and especially in the middle east (outside of Israel).
