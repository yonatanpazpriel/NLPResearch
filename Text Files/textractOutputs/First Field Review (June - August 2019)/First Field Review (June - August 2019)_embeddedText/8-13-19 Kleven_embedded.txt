From: John Kleven Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: not a correct use of taxpayer money for at-school education
Hello,
I reviewed much of the .docx curriculum guides and feel this is an enormous waste of taxpayer money. I would urge the CA state authorities to get back to the basics: reading, writing, math and other core classes to stay educationally competitive worldwide.
Sincerely, John Kleven CA Resident and taxpayer
