Times you should add or amend by adding to references/reading materials.
On the references to Real Estate and sample Deed Restrictions- Those were all made illegal due to the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Also the Unruh Civil Rights Act of 1959.
As to Real Estate Lending ï¿½ Relining was outlawed by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974. Also Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The Governing Agencies (HUD, CA Bureau of Real Estate, CA Dept of Corporations, and the CFPB) have extensive mandatory ongoing training and supervision over these areas). As a byline, in 43 years of Residential Lending I have never seen or heard of any acts of Redlining or Intention Discrimination simply because it is bad business aside from being illegal.
Also describing "Capitalism as a form of Oppression". We all know that is untrue and that connection should be struck from any reference in teaching a child. A student should be free from mischaracterizations and untruths about the very basic nature of our free and prosperous nature of our society.
Colonialism is not a factor when describing the history of the United States- We have never had "Colonies".
In the Asian Studies section, there should be a reference to the Liberation of the Philippine People by the United State during WW2. I feel strongly about the sacrifices my own father personally made to assist in this endeavor as a Soldier in the Pacific Theater. Ask any person of Philippine descent and they will agree.
The same could be said for the Populations of Southeast Asia during and after the Vietnam conflict.
When discussing Sexism and Women's Equality, don't forget to mention the harmful effects of Shiria Law against a whole class of people.
I agree that the Anti Israel and Anti Jewish rhetoric in the model is very troubling and you should have a section on Jewish Oppression as well as Irish and Italian Oppression and discrimination.
Diversity is a wonderful thing to be taught and embraced. It serves the greater society and is a unifying principal to uphold. The model does often do not express that sentiment with fairness, objectivity and a historical fact based perspective.
