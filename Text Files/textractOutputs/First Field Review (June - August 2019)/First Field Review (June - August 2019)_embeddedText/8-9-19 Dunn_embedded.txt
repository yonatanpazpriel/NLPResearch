There are several problems with the Model Curriclum May 2019 Draft. It leaves out American Jews as an ethnic group. Anti-semitism is not recognized as a form of racism. At a time when a shooter killed people in a local Poway synagogue, we need to teach sensitivity and tolerance for Jews (and all ethnic groups).
