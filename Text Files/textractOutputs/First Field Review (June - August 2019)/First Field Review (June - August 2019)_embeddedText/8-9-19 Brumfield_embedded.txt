From: Harker Brumfield Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
Any model curriculum should be based and taught on facts and historical events, not current idealism. The American educational system should not change, reconstruct, or modify history according to current politically correct interpretation. That is called indoctrination, not education. The viewpoint of the teacher or current society has no place in education. World view is a personal matter. Just present the facts/history as it happened. It is up to the students to decide what to do with the facts.
Thank you for allowing me to express my thoughts.
