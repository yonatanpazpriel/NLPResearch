I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. Arab and Pacific islanders are particularly marginalized communities that feel the isolation in public schools that other groups do not fell, and should be included in any ethnic studies curriculum Such inclusion challenges the xenophobia and discrimination that is prevalent in our society, and makes way for a critical discussion of the manner in which Arab Americans have contributed to our country. Such discussions are essential to creating a safe and welcoming environment. As a Public School teacher I have directly witnessed the negative impact of exclusion and marginalization on both our Arab and Pacific Islander students, and on the student body as a whole who continue to hold stereotypical ideas unless they are contested by a well-thought out curriculum.

I support the objectives listed on p. 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab American as a way to challenge xenophobia and discrimination. I also support the inclusion of Mizrachi Jews, as Arab peoples, in the curriculum so that people will understand the diversity of the Arab experience.

Arab people and their contributions to history have frequently been ignored. It takes great effort on the part of the teacher to research and include such history. As a retired math teacher I know that Arab people contributed greatly to the development of mathematical thinking. I did include this in my curriculum so that my Arab and Middle Eastern students could see themselves in my curriculum, and to counter the prejudice that other students had about Arabs. We need to understand how deeply the Arab world developed math, engineering, literature, and was literally, "the cradle of civilization."

As a Jew, a queer person and a socially conscious teacher I wholeheartedly support the complete inclusion of Arab and Arab American studies in the ethnic studies curriculum. P. 233 Including a history of migration to the U.S. is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular, for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.

As a retired public school teacher I know and witnessed that my Arab American students either faced discrimination and harassment or were invisible in the schools. We have worked hard in California to develop a curriculum of inclusion for all students. Arab Americans must be a part of this history. s
