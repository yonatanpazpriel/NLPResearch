To Whom it May Concern: Having reviewed the Ethnic Studies Curriculum on the CDE website, and watching the video linked below summarizing the radical and ridiculous ideas being promoted, I am against this curriculum for K-12 public education in California. Stating that capitalism and father figures are racist and oppressive is simply untrue. Statements and ideas like this in the curriculum are being used to shape young minds with dangerous and harmful propaganda.
Are there ideas and modification to be made to be more inclusive in what is being taught in public schools? Easy answer is yes. Is this proposal the right one? Easy answer is no! I am a proponent of including the thoughts and ideas of many as educational resources are developed, reviewed, edited and published. I am not an advocate of just 18 people developing a curriculum ï¿½ which is what happened here - knowing that their outlandish ideas are tied to a much larger radical agenda.
Let's involve parents, educators, and researchers in the discussion and then present ideas and curriculums that elevate information that are true, worthy, and relevant. Clearly the draft that is published now does not include any of these elements.
