Dear Madame or Sir:
There is so much morally wrong with the content of the current textual body. I am anathema to dramatics, however reading it truly brought chills down my spine and tears to my eyes.
I clearly recognize that I reside in a State that's politics typically run averse from mine. Ive always welcomed that! Discourse, free speech, and the battle for Truth are what make our country the greatest. Having the ability to argue and debate with people that have diametrically opposite beliefs and outlooks than myself is a terrific thing!
Sadly, the text as it currently is written is frighteningly appalling. It smacks of anti-semitism in both its ignoring of historical Jewish experiences and FACTS as well as its inclusion of shocking and hateful tropes.
Hate is hate. It is not complicated.
Lies are lies. They cannot be masked by an "opinion" or a "perspective."
Anti-semitism is anti-semitism. And the draft as it stands now is just that. It is filled with hatred by omission and outright lies. The remark that, "...Palestinians (are) living under apartheid conditions..." is just one of many (truly too many to count) statements that are not only an outright lie, it also belies the goal of the author(s) - to minimize the Jewish plight by circumventing the truth of the FACTS present in the Arab - Israeli conflict.
Please. As a proud Californian that loves his State and loves his Country. Please do not publish this as it stands currently. My children are a part of the spectacular public school system of California. Please do not be a part of the proliferation of lies and hate in their world.

Shame on all of us if we allow, participate in, or create hatred and bigotry toward any group of people.
