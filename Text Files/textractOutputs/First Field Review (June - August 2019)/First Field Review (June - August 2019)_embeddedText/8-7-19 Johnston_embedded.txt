In general, the curriculum gives many opportunities for students to engage in meaningful discussion and critical thinking when it comes to ethnic studies. But on the other hand, there are SO many subtle, one-sided views that are pushing a radical, liberal agenda onto our young people. Examples: capitalism is a power used to suppress others. False, capitalism is one of the reasons so many want to come to out country. Also, you list two convicted cop killers as people of significance within black history. Also, when listing cases of police brutality, which yes does exist and it shouldn't, some of the cases were not even found to be police brutality when investigated. This leads me to believe you are pushing an anti-law enforcement agenda into the minds of our teens. And also there is an assignment to look at foods Native Americans ate before colonialism. Great assignment except for the section that discourages teens to take control of their health and their weight, and place blame on society and people in power by suppressing them through processed foods. Again, completely false. Are we raising the next generation to be victims or are we encouraging them that they can take control of their health and living a healthy lifestyle?

If this curriculum goes through with these subtle pushes of a redical, liberal agenda, my kids will not be attending school in this state.
