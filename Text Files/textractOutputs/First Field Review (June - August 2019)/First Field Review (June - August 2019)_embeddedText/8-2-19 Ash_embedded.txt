Add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, and their contributions to society: medicine, science, movie industry � so much to choose from. The curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, and its true purpose, which seeks to end Israel's existence.

Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country It is actually the Jewish homeland.

Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of the corrupt Palestinian leadership.

INTRODUCTION Barbara Ash

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disturbing and disappointing.
