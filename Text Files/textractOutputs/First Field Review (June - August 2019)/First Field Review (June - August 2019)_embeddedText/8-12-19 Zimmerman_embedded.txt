I am writing to oppose this curriculum as it appears on your website. I haven't read all of it, but I have read enough to realize that this strident polemic is intended to foster divisiveness rather than to promote knowledge and community. To start with, it is so full of jargon that many people, I have a postgraduate degree, will be unable to understand it. cisheteropatriarchy, really! I urge you to start over. It would appear that the wrong people are out there in front of this. The ethnic studies program at San Francisco State should not be a model for anything, given all of the divisiveness it has fostered.
