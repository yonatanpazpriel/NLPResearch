From: George Wolkon Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comments on ethnic curriculum
� Glossary and Bibliography page.
o EXAMPLE: Page 1 omits a definition of antisemitism; and page 2 includes a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions).
o It also does not include the harm the boycott does to the employment opportunities for the Palestinians and the potential harm it does to any two state solution in the area.
� Also refer to pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and pages 264-269 in the Sample Course Models.
o EXAMPLE: Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61); and pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to accuse Israel falsely of colonizing land.
It also seems to me that the rich accomplishments and contributions of persons of Jewish heritage are not sufficiently covered in the curriculum.
� Thank you for your attention to these comments.
� George Wolkon, Ph.D.
