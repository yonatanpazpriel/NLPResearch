From: Ed G. Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 4:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti Israel content in the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Please modify the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to remove the one-sided bias towards the Palestinians and address the security concerns of the Israeli people. Since 1948, the Palestinians refused peace, the Israelis continually offered peace. If this Curriculum is adopted, it will be an embarrassment to California and its people.
