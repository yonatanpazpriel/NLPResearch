From: Harriet Sternberg Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies proposed curriculum is anti-Semitic
Please do the right thing and protect the rights of humanity. Your proposal is blatantly anti-Semitic, and sadly lacking in its address of the Jewish population of the U.S. as an ethnic minority. Keep America sane and remember history and don't repeat past mistakes. Harriet Zucker
