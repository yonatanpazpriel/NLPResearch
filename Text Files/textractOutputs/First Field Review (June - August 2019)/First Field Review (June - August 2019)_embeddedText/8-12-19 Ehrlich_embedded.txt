From: Thomas Ehrlich Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: JIAC@betham.org Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Commission:
We write as concerned citizens of California who are parents, grandparents, and Jews. We experienced anti-Semitism ourselves when we are young and believe the proposed new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will foment more discrimination, though we know this is not the intent. . Please revise the Curriculum consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter.
Respectfully,
Ellen & Thomas Ehrlich, Palo Alto
