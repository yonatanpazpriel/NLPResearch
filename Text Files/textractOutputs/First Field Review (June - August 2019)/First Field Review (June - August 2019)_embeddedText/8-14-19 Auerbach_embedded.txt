Dear California Department of Education and Instructional Quality Commission:
These are fraught times. With so much xenophobia, bigotry and racism emanating from our federal government, and with the racial/religious underpinnings of many horrifying public attacks, I saw the announcement in the LA Times that the California government was creating a curriculum to teach tolerance in schools. By illuminating our common humanity, we can perhaps change young minds and waylay some of those who would `grow up' to be mass murderers of innocent people.
In looking at your proposed curriculum, I was appalled to see that your treatment of Israelis, and by extension of all Jews, was so one-sided and fell so neatly into the coordinated Arab campaign to injure Israel's very existence.
I am sending you some of my comments ï¿½ your form is really not long enough to contain all my points. I am also sending this form to several colleagues, including fellow journalists, for their comments.
If your goal is to be fair and balanced, you have missed the mark. More work is necessary or you will be propagating the very sentiments your program is meant to counter.
Sincerely,
Beverley Auerbach
