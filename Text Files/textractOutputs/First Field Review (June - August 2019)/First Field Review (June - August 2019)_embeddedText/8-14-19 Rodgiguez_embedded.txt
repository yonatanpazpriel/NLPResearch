From: jrodzz918 Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 10:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethic studies curriculum
I am requesting that the ethnic studies curriculum not be implemented in our public schools. I feel our children need more time in math, english, literature and history. Also some physical activity. Juan Rodriguez
