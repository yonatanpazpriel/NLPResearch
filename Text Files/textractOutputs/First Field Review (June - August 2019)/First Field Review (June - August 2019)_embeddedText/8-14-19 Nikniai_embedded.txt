This course makes many unchallenged assumptions of oppression and the sources of oppression that are debatable. It one-sidedly promotes one side of very controversial issues. Given that, much of this course presents a bias that
goes unchallenged. This course work assumes, when it should

present both sides to an issue and let students use their critical

thinking skills to come to their own evidence-based conclusion.

Examples are below:

"Years after slavery, many African-Americans continue to live in poverty because of racist, discriminatory laws."

The issue of current racism is a debatable one as to extent, and yet this is presented as an unchallenged content and learning objective.

Ch. 2, p. 2

Dismantle white supremacy and institutional racism.
Again, I disagree with presenting controversial issues as absolutes. Students should be able to come to their own conclusions whether there is such a thing as white supremacy, after presenting more than one side to this issue. This is still a debatable issue.

"Some examples of systems of power are: white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy."

Capitalism is an economic system. The idea of it being a system of power in reference to this course assumes that it's an oppressive system. Again, this is debatable, as there are some who would argue that it is only capitalism that raises standards of living (referencing Adam Smith.)
