Quote: "As such, it can grow its original language to serve these needs with purposeful respellings of terms, including history as herstory and women as womxn, connecting with a gender and sexuality lens"

My opinion: These terms are not necessary to create a fair, objective curriculum. Webster's Dictionary defines history as : a chronological record of significant events (such as those affecting a nation or institution) often including an explanation of their causes.

I am a woman and I don't feel as if students need to view the story of our past through a feminist lens.

Use the lesson to promote the positive aspects of the United States, please! Yes, our country has flaws that should be discussed and addressed. However, it is a place of freedom and opportunity. Young students need to be encouraged to unite and work together, regardless of ethnicity or social standing. Strife and opposition accomplishes nothing but more hate.

Students should examine the contributions of every ethnic group to our great nation. At the same time, they should be encouraged to resist hate, resentment, and revenge. No person benefits from trying to repair and compensate for events that happened hundreds of years ago. Future generations can build upon the mistakes of the past, use history as a lesson, and create a better world.
