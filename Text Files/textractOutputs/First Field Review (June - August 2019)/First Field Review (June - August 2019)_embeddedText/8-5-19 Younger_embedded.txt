General/IntroductionArab Americans are presented and studied, but not Jewish Americans? Why?? If the goal as stated in the introduction is to eliminate racism and hate and to further cultural appreciation, then any group that experiences those issues in the US needs representation in the curriculum. And, there are many similarities in the experiences in these various groups in the US (immigration, assimilation pressures, acceptance or challenges faced by dominant groups, laws to restrict rights etc)--that should be the focus of the studies. Why did the groups come? What challenges did and do they face? How or why has racism historically been promoted, and what has or has not changed over time in the US in regards to this? How can we as US residents make sure all people in our borders are treated with dignity? Some of the curriculum does this well, but the pieces with the Arab American experience feels like it lacks in that cohesiveness to other groups. And leaving out Jewish American experiences seems to heighten that divide of making the whole curriculum appear biased. If the ethnic studies model curriculum were holistically focused more on how experiences are shaped by policies and attitudes in the US towards various

groups over time, it would be way more impactful and meaningful for students, and then applicable in many contexts. Line 4957 and 4958BDS movement does not need to be a part of a curriculum focused on Arab Americans. BDS is a movement aimed at Israel. The rest of the ethnic studies model curriculum focuses on minority groups in the United States- how their experiences within the borders of the US are impacted by experiences of being a minority. Therefore to include BDS does not keep within the context of AMERICAN focused ethnic studies. This is true also of the comparison of Palestine to Mexico as a border issue. Israel is defending her border from terrorist attacks. TheUS is not doing the same at the Mexican border. Also these borders cannot be compared for geographical reasons as the border for Palestine does not physically connect with the border of the US. Again, if the focus is on the experience of Arab Americans, then it should stay focused on what is happening in our nation's borders. This is all especially true given that there is no counter argument to these movements presented. To truly be an ethnic studies curriculum of minority or affected groups in the US there needs to be an equal focus on Jewish Americans and the existence and rise of anti-semitism in the US. Line 5159-5160The result of the 1948 war is presented by one viewpoint. Again, there is another minority group involved here (Jews)who themselves were displaced from their own homelands (and refused entry to the US during WWII). So a better approach would be to state that Wars often displace people. When Israel was formed after the British rule, during the war of 1948, many Palestinians left their homeland. This is unfortunately true of many many groups during war...they are forced to leave, or choose to leave for safety and better opportunity or due to changes in their homelands. If you are going to teach about Arab Americans, you need to also teach about Jewish Americans. The better approach is to

actually compare these two groups... they have many similarities and overlaps in their histories and share an experience of prejudism in the US. Lines 5792 and 5802The lines in this rap song only present Israel as a colonizing country, but there is no place in any other part of the curriculum that presents an opposing view to this. I would suggest replacing this song with one that does not get into the politics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Otherwise, as it currently stands, this presents a one-sided and politicized view of events in the world, without regard to how Jewish Americans feel on this issue. Ethnic Studies should unite people and not further divide. Pg. 237- Use of Israel-Palestine here makes it seem like all this area is Arab. It is important to note that many groups live in this shared area. Glossary,pg2- BDS is listed as a term with the definition to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid." This is a one-sided argument,without any counter arguments to this movement's views presented. Again, as an educator, I do not think the BDS movement belongs in this ethnic studies course at all. It is confusing to focus on the American experience of these various groups but then to only have one politicial movement that is an area of focus for one group but which also lies outside the scope of Islamaphobia in the US. I do not think the BDS movement belongs in the curriculum at all.
