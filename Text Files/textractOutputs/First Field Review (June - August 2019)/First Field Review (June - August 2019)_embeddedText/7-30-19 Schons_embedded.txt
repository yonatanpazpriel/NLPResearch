From: Christopher Schons Sent: Monday, July 29, 2019 8:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Kenneth McDonald Subject: Public comment on the proposed "ethnic studies" curriculum:
It is racist and toxic, and will leave students with an inadequate understanding of what has made the USA function so brilliantly for hundreds of millions of people so far; it will also help leave without the tools necessary to make one's way successfully through America's economy and society.
Best regards,
