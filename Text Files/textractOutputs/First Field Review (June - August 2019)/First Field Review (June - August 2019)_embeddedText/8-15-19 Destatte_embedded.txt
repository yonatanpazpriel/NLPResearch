The "Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum" is an astonishing piece of work.
Your model curriculum professes to promote social justice and harmony by persuading students that they are members of mutually exclusive competing tribes. Tribes that are defined by race, ethnicity, religion, gender, regional origins, income, education, social position, and occupation. Tribes that exploit and oppress members of competing tribes.
This curriculum, if approved, will teach division, not unity. It will teach students to distrust, not trust. It will teach students to distrust each other, their parents, religious teachings, history, community standards, and our local, state, and national social, economic, and political institutions. This curriculum will breed disunity, not unity; disharmony, not harmony. It will not heal presumed old wounds or right presumed old wrongs. It will, however, inflict new wounds and commit new wrongs on our society.

I believe the majority of ordinary citizens of this state, if accurately informed and asked about this curriculum, would express opposition to it. Unfortunately, the proponents of this curriculum have little interest in going out of their way to ensure they receive timely feedback from a well-informed citizenry. Sadly, very few citizens will take time out from their busy lives to learn about the curriculum's content; and, of those few, many will not exercise their right to express their opposition--calculating, as I do, that state bureaucrats are not interested in the views of ordinary citizens. Dare we hope that state bureaucrats will not mistake a shortage of critical feedback as approval?

On its face this curriculum proposes to impose on the state's high school students views that promote social disharmony and decay.

Permit me to close with a note about style. Quoting Sir Winston Churchill, "Short words are best, and old words, when short, are best of all."

The pompous, pretentious, turgid, faddish, and at times downright silly language and spelling (hxrstorically, hxrstory, cisheteropatriarchy, . . .) in your draft might impress a certain class of academics and politicians, but it also serves to distract attention from the predictable harmful effects the proposed curriculum will cause to our communities over time. As public servants you should respect, not try to deceive or to talk down to, the people who pay your salaries, who entrust their children's futures to you, and whom you are sworn to serve.

I urge deciding authorities to reject the California "Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum."
