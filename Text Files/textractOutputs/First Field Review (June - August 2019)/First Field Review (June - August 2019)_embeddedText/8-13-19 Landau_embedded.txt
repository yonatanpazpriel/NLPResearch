Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I write to note two highly objectionable features of this section. First, unlike for example, the section on Chicano/a Americans, this
section indoctrinates instead of encouraging discussion. The section on Chicano/a Americans includes readings and arguments both for and against the concepts and policies it presents. The section on Arab Americans does not. Instead of awakening students to the complexity of concepts such as ethnicity and homeland, it instructs students about Palestinian grievance and inculcates support of Palestinians. See especially lines 5792, 5802-4, 5820-21.
The second objectionable feature is related to the first, for the authors of this section are both confused about the relation of religion to identity as a member of the Arab world and use that confusion to further their advocacy of Palestinian irredentism. The authors acknowledge that some late-nineteenth-century Arabs who came to the U.S. were Jews (line 5143), but then fail to acknowledge that Arabs who came to the U.S. after the creation of Israel of included a large number of Jews. Lines 5158-5161 refer to the "hundreds of thousands of Palestinians" who had been "displaced" following the War of 1948 against Israel. The authors do not recognize that an approximately equal number of Arab Jews were expelled from their countries at the same time. As a significant proportion of these Arab Jews came to the U.S., many settling in southern California, this section erases a Californian ethnic minority from its model course on ethnic minority studies. Just as the authors erase Arab Jews, so they erase Israel. They instruct students to include "Israel/Palestine" on a map of Arab "countries" (line 5030) and declare that "Palestine/Israel" is a "state" (line 5138. Both erasures further the authors' advocacy of the Palestinian cause.
