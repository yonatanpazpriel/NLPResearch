I wanted to write you and express my concerns with your be curriculum of ethic studies. I understand that it is bias and based on a perception of a group of people who are anti Semitic. By forcing this propaganda upon our children we are acting like Nazi Germany in a more excepted and political correctness way. Please do not force this on our children. I would also like what elected officials are supporting this curriculum.
