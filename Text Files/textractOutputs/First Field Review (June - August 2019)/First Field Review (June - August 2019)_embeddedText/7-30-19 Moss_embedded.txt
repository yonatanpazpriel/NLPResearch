Is this a template for an Ethnic Studies curriculum, or an instruction manual for how to destroy the country? Where would my child pick up his brown shirt that goes along with this course?

This curriculum is far too radical and incendiary to be teaching to anyone, let alone children. Many of its assumptions are flat out wrong, such as the demonization of capitalism and the constant and unending blaming of racial issues for all society's ills. The use of "nonstandard" words is an asinine.

California has unbelievably bad scores in math and reading, skills that a modern population needs to thrive. If a single second is spent on this curriculum it is too much.
