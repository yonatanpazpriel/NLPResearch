Comments pertaining to this document as well as general comments:
It is difficult being a Jew in America today. Simply put: White Supremacists see us as gun targets (as a case in point, I greet an armed guard who searches my handbag every time I attend religious services) while the far-left progressive movement seeks to vilify American-Jews by assuming that all of us are in lockstep with all the actions of Israel (this is as absurd as saying that all Americans agree with the actions of the Trump administration). I too am a progressive, however, I do not endorse how this curriculum portrays the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in such a one-sided manner.

Over the years I have been called "dirty Jew" (while being physically assaulted by a neighbor for no apparent reason other than my Jewishness) I have been asked earnestly if I had horns (by a devout Christian) and have been told by people who did not know that I was Jewish (on several occasions within a professional context) that Jews are "cheap."

This is what it is like to be a Jew in America.

Yes, Jews are able to "blend" in America because of our skin color, however, that can often be uncomfortable. For example, America joyfully shuts down to celebrate Christmas as if it were a national holiday. Last year I politely removed and boxed Christmas ornaments that were placed on the streetlight in front of my home by a neighborhood association. For many Jews Christmas is a time when we feel isolated in our own communities.

Finally, there is a widespread lack of recognition of the cross-cultural existence that many American Jews live. Our homes are filled with our own ethnic foods

and artifacts that pertain to our heritage and religion. Those of us who are religious, engage in religious practices that require us to master a language other than English, and we engage in many rituals that are foreign to most Americans.
In closing, I would ask you to think carefully about how you teach what it means to be an oppressed people in the United States. It does no one benefit to pit one people against another.
