Judging from the success of countries where people are very aware of ethnicity - Syria, Iraq, Sri Lanka, South Africa, Rwanda, etc., I think it might be better if we taught students to focus less on ethnicity, and more on what we share.
I'd start from the declaration of independence:"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men (this is an old word for people) are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
Let's teach the kids that wherever their ancestors were from, now their ethnicity is "American".
Good luck with the curriculum,
