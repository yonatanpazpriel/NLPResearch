Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview.

Shouldn't we be teaching kids the truth? Something based on facts and, yes...science?

The Outline states, "All students should be better equipped with the knowledge and skills to successfully navigate our increasingly diverse society." What skills exactly? What does it mean to "navigate" and why is that an important part of learning to be American? (oops...did I say something racist?)

Instead of an objective and complete account of the history of "ethnic groups" and their current situation(s), this overview is a biased portrait that pathetically portrays any unfairness, suffering and victimization to racial identity as caused by capitalism and white men.

It seems to have no other purpose than serving as a kind of PC road map to create ideological activists based on perceived or actual racial identity. (Althouogh it seems to also have forgotten to include the millions of racial fluid individuals and societies in the outline). Why?

Why does this program ignore Jewish and pro-Israel ethnicity and groups as well as Arab-Israeli issues and glaringly omits issues of anti-Semitism? You discuss "umbrella Plans" but on what basis would you define and accept them?

The description of the capitalist system as the root of oppressive hierarchies and the fundamental driver of all or most forms of oppression is quite disturbing, in addition to being defunct and absurd on its face.
Educators just need to look at history prior to capitalism to see all manner and extent of actual oppression. Quite the opposite, capitalism is the only answer to an overwhelming and total state of poverty and misery, and in fact served to lift the entire world (people of all ethnicities, races and cultures) out of poverty over the last 75 years.
No other system has created such wealth and prosperity for the most people. Without wealth provided by capitalism, we can't afford to take care of the indigent. Is that the plan?
I am also concerned with the re-definition of terms and use of "academic language" use throughout this document such as "herstory" and "hxrstory" to replace "history", "Chicano/a/x" , and the definition and use of the term "whiteness". It was so considerate to include a "glossary of terms" to assist me in translating/decoding it.
These "guidelines" are themselves an unacceptable exercise in racism, bigotry and division in both nature and content serving only to separate people of this great country instead of bringing them together. It seems like a very poorly thought out program that harbors resentment and hostility to real racial integration and racial success that capitalism has been so integral to allowing all races, ethnicities and cultures to thrive. Is that the plan

It also begs the question - "Will kids be graded on having the politically correct answers?" After force-feeding our kids this program based on do you really think we will have a more harmonious and aware society?
If that is the plan than I think you have a real winner in this program. I just have to wonder what kind of world you "educators" live in to come up with such an ominously divisive and corrosive program, that will only serve to dissolve trust between people, and will leave them unprepared to work anywhere but for Antifa.
This entire program should be thrown out-and started again from scratch with an emphasis this time on how the American system - while not perfect, is far and away the most equitable � with mechanisms to change/remedy injustice (slavery for instance), instead of a program with an overarching emphasis on victimhood.
VICTIMHOOD=RESENTMENT=DISCONTENT=SOCIAL UNREST/VIOLENCE
Is that the plan? Prove me wrong.
