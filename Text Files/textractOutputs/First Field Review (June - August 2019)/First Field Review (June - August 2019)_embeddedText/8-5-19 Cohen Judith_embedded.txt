I urge the state of California, where I reside and have been paying taxes for the past 32 years, to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. As an RN who works in the public health sector, I see many American Jews from the former Soviet Union who fled that repressive regime to find refuge in the USA. They suffer from anxiety and depression. The same goes for Jews from Iran who fled that country after the Iranian revolution in 1979. In addition: to not include the recent surge in antiSemitism and the physical threat to Jewish students in some American colleges is equal to the bias you are trying to eliminate in your curriculum.
