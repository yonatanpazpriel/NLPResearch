From: Mark Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern:
I recently learned from my Rabbi about urgent concerns with the Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum. As a Jew and a retired college Dean, I am very disturbed. Sprecific concerns include:
1. Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned. 2. Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimintion even though half of religious-based hae crimes in the United States are against Jews. 3. The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective. 4. A song with language that suggests Jews control the media in included.
Please evaluate these concerns. I am shocked that this ignorance would be on display in curriculum in the state of California , especilly during this time of hate and divisiveness in our country.
