Good Morning,
This is very scary. Capitalism is what America is built on. This curriculum clearly supports Communism or Socialism. Is it sponsored by the UN? Very SCARY stuff. I have a lot of family in California and I have already started to contact them. Who proposed this?
Very concerned and frightened citizen,
