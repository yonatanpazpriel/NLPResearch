Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
It would appear this curriculum is bias from its conceptual foundation. Unless honesty and truth are the foundation for debate on the issues between Palestine, BDS and Israel, the curriculum and that which you're attempting to accomplish is flawed from its inception. The person(s) perpetrating this hatred are the root of evil couched with the dignity of Government as a cover for their hate. But goodness and truth will always prevail, because the world could not survive unless there is more goodness in the world than evil. Think about it.
