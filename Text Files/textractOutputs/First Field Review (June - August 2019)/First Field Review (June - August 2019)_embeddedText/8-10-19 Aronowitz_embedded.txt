From: neuropsychkids Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Concern
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am really disappointed and saddened by the very unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a parent and psychologist who works with children everyday I see the incredible impact of what you don't say. Not mentioning Jews and anti semitism anytime, but especially now allows for hate to spread and become acceptable.
I am a grandchild of holocaust survivors. To not consider that honorific tragedy relevant enough to be worthy of mention is beyond comprehension and goes against exactly what you proclaim to be working toward.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Jen Aronowitz
