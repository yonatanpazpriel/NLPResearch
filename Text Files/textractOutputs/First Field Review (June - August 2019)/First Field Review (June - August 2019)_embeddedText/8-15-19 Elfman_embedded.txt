Generally, I strongly oppose the Ethnic Studies curriculum proposed by the CA Board of Education. Proper history classes can cover all notable donations to society by ALL notable donaters as it should. In my opinion, the Ethnic Studies is NOT the facts of history and is very biased and divisive and I don't want my granddaughter's head filled with this nonsense.
