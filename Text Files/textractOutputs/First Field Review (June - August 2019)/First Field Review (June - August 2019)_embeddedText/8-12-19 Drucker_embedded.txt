From: Jacqueline Drucker Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 6:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your program teaches anti-semitism as a good thing.
Did not enough Jews (including my grandparents) already die in the Crusades, in the Spanish Inquisition and in Hitler's gas chambers that you have to teach anti-semitismwith this pro BDS stance? People fleeing terror are not the same as people wanting more money and more free (to them) government services. Clean up your ethnic studies lessons. Jacqueline Drucker
