Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This is a general comment in support of the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. This content is essential for any student to learn. As the parent of a child in a dual-immersion language program (German), adding an ethnic studies framework makes clear sense to me. Moreover, as someone who holds a Ph.D. in French and Francophone Studies from UCLA, I can say that learning about colonialism, migration, diaspora, and slavery in graduate school was an eyeopening experience. I wish that I had been educated in these concepts much earlier in my life. I hope my son has this opportunity and that this framework is adopted.
