I am writing about your proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
It is hard to imagine a valid ethnic studies curriculum that does not include the Jewish experience in America. With a rise in anti-Semitism all over the world, it is critical that students understand the truth about the Jewish contributions to America and have the ability to detect the falsehoods and stereotypes that have caused enormous pain to our community. Moreover, the cynical and manipulative BDS movement is lauded in your materials rather than called out for its own discriminatory intent, an ironic element of an ethnic studies "model" curriculum.
I urge you to revise this curriculum consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus.
