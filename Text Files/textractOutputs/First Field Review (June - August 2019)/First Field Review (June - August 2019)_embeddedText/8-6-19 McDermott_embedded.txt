From: Andrew McDermott Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 3:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Ethnic Studies Model
Your proposed program perpetuates the victimhood ideology that compromises the ability of students to develop and apply the skills and attitudes needed to support themselves when they become adults. It should be rejected in its entirety and replaced with the sort of curriculum that worked for decades before the education department was taken over by bureaucrats. Examples abound-Waldorf, Montessori and classical curricula have all proven extraordinarily effective even in the most destitute of neighborhoods.
Sincerely, Andrew McDermott Sonoma, CA
