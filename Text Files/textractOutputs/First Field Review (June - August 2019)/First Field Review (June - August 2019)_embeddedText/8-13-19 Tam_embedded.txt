From: R Tam Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies comments
I am opposed to the idea of mandatory Ethnic Studies because many of the so-called experts in the field have strong opinions and are unable to give a fair, unbiased view of the subject. One group's idea of social justice is not the same for another group. For example, many left-wing ethnic studies supporters (primarily Latino ir Black) believe that affirmative action in college admissions is a good idea. They think it's about justice for them. But at the same time, it hurts immigrant Asian-Americans. Many AsianAmericans see it as outright racism against them.
The same applies for Palestinian and Jews, Turks and Armenians, etc.
Unless you can get unbiased writers, this type of class will become political indoctrination. At this point, it is unlikely such unbiased authors exist. Many of them support an ethnic studies requirement because they want their opinions to be heard and pushed to our children.
The kids already have enough graduation requirements for high school. Many of our high school kids can barely read, write, or do basic math. They should be focused on these subjects first.
