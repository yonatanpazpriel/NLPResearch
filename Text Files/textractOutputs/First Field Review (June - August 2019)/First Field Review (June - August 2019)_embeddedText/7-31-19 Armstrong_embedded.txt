From: Jim Armstrong Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 2:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment on developing curriculum
I am parent of children in CA public schools and I went through the CA public school system myself. I strongly object to the fundamentals of the curriculum as outlined at the website. https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/esmcpubliccomment.asp?mod=article_inline
I do not want you to teach ethnic studies to my child. Race and ethnicity need to stay out of public education and preferrable out of public discourse altogether. I also find the term social justice to be offensive and race baiting. School is about teaching the children communication and critical learning skills. It is not the place of public education to teach social values to our children � that is the job of the parents alone.
When I heard the word "ethnic" I hear the word race � and I find the curriculum you are developing to be racist, in the most negative way. I also find the advisory board you have chosen to be biased towards racism. I object! I find your curriculum offensive! When we are offending others do we persist, or do we stop and try to understand why? Please lets have a conversation about racism in our schools as being perpetuated by you.
Sincerely
Jim Armstrong
