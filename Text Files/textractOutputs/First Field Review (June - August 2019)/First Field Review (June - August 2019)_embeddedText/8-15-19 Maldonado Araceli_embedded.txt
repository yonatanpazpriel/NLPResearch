From: AraceliMaldonado Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: I completely disagree and opposed to this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As a citizen, I'm deeply concerned about this California's new Ethic Studies curriculum. I found it has a bias bent and Anti-Semitic/ Anti- Israel in its teaching. This curriculum falls under the guise of a false cause fallacy concerning the conflict in the middle east. I completely disagree and opposed to what is stated in Chapter 4 glossary #30-40 this goes beyond Education, its strait out propaganda.
Sincerely, Araceli Maldonado.
