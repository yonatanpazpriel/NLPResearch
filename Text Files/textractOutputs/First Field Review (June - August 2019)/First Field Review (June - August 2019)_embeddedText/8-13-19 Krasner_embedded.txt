My concern is teaching about the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. The topic is very complicated and polerized. To provide student with the Arab perspective is very unfair to the Israeli (Jewish) perspective.
Areas of concern include:
 The identification of the country of Israel as "Israel-Palestine" and then as "Palestine/Israel." (Line 5033 on page 237 and Line 5141 on page 241)
 The definition of Nakba as the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War (Line 5162 on page 242).
 The lyrics of rapper Busta Rhyme's song "Arab Money," Arab rapper Narcy's song in response "The Real Arab Money", and the subsequent resolution, apology and reconciliation between the two singers.
 Lesson Plan: Hip Hop as Resistance (Line 5407 on page 253 to Line 5479 on page 256)
 Busta Rhyme's song "Arab Money"  Narcy's song "The Real Arab Money" (Line 5614 on page 261 to 5693 on page
264)  Busta Apologizes for Releasing Arab Money (Line 5580 on page 260 to 5612 on
page 261)
The assigning of the following sample topics for student reports, which include:
 Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter  Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel  Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico (Lines 4956 ï¿½ 4958 on page
234)
