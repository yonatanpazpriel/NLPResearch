It's ironic how your committee has completely forgotten all the occasions the Anti Deformation has represented not only Jewish interests, but minority interests in court. How about the number of Nobel Prize winners compared to the various ethnicities? I wonder if there were ANY Jews on this committee? When it comes to Israel, was there any mention of the war was started by all the surrounding Arab countries when the United Nations partitioned Palestine? How about the call to the Palestinians to leave because the Arab armies would drive the Jews into the Sea. We never threw them out, they willing left, but changed the story to make themselves Martyrs. As far as the the poor people whose homes are destroyed. When almost continual rockets are fired from civilian populated areas as they have been for 70 years - just what are the Israeli's to do? What happened to the peace agreement Yasir Arafat signed (40?) years ago but never honored. There could have been years of peace instead of conflict. When we say Never Forget - we do not, but it is obvious that the rest of the world does - especially the people on your committee.
And as my husband said - why should there be a separate Ethnic Studies course instead of including the subject in History classes?
