Page 1. The offering of the word hxrstory boarders on the ludicrous. The word history derives from the Greek word historia meaning inquiry. It does not have gender connotation. Implying such detracts from the noble intent of history. Explaining to students the origin and meaning of the word history seems to be a better approach.
