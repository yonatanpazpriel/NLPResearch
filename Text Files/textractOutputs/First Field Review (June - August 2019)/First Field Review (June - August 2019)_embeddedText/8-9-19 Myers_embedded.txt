Hi there,
I am very alarmed at how American Jews are portrayed in this curriculum. It is shocking that the contribution of American Jews would be devalued, that Anti Semitism could be ignored, and that there would be a subtle encouraging of a boycott of Israel.
You seem to omit a definition of anti-Semitism, and instead include on page 2 a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions).
In the Sample Course Models, in the Arab American Studies Outline, there are several problematic topics on page 234:
4956 Line Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter
4957 Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel
4958 Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico
In the same section, on page 242, there is politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61) and on pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) it uses the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
I am appalled at the overt bias against Jews and Israel. I hope you are able to make the appropriate changes to this.
