I object to the use of terminology such as white supremacy, oppression, and describing capitalism as something evil. Also the respelling of words such as history and woman is absolutely ridiculous. Those words have been used for centuries. Changing the spelling doesn't do anything but confuse people. I would also like to voice my opinion that this be an elective and parents can opt out. It should not be mandatory. There is definitely a liberal anti-white slant in the overview, I can't imagine what would be taught to our children when teachers add their own interpretations and viewpoints.
