From: joel teisch Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC
Please be advised that as a parent of three students who matriculated the the San Mateo School District and the grandparent of four youngsters presently enrolled in the Oakland school district I strongly encourage the Department of Education to reconsider the ESMC sections that are demeaning to Jewish Americans. These items will only encourage the already divisive atmosphere in our state and country at large. Thank you. Joel A. Teisch Hillsborough, CA
