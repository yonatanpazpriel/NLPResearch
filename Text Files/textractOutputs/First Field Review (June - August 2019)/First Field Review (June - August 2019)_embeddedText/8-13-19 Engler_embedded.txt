-----Original Message----From: Barbara Engler Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Opposition to proposed changes to CA public school curriculum ESMC
To the Cal. Dept. of Education / Instructional Quality Commission and Those This May Concern:
I am a California licensed-attorney, long-time resident of California and the parent of three children who attended a public high school in San Mateo, CA.
In these hate-filled violent times, I am extremely concerned about the proposed curriculum (ESMC). As a Jewish American, I am very disturbed by the numerous instances of anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli content and course material throughout the ESMC. I strongly encourage the Dept. of Education to seriously reconsider numerous aspects of the ESMC that are demeaning to Jewish Americans, particularly those who support the Jewish national homeland, the State of Israel. In politicizing the Israel-Palestinian conflict, the ESMC is highly polarizing and will divide students rather than bring them together to an improved multi-cultural sensitivity respectful of all ethnicities, including Jews.
Thank you for your consideration, and please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
Best regards, Barbara Engler,Esq. California resident for 61 years Parent of 3 who attended public high school in San Mateo
