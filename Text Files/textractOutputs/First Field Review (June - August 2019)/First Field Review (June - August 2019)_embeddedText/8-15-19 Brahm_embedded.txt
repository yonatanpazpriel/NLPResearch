I am writing to voice my concern in the new curriculum for "ethnic studies". I do not support the changes and encouragement of left wing ideas to our innocent school children especially elementary grades. The BDS agenda is wrong and has no place in our school system. You need to concentrate on teaching our young students READING, WRITING AND ARITHMETIC! I feel you have failed miserably at this and this generation will not have the skills they need to be a great generation. The liberal agenda is not educating these kids in basic skills in English. Their handwriting is atrocious. Their spelling is atrocious. They cannot do simple math in their head without their phone calculator. It's been a dumbing down of our students for too long. Wake up! Sincerely, Donna Brahm
