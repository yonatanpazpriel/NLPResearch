From: Isaac Engel Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 9:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
While we very much support the concept of a required ethnic studies course for California students, We are extremely concerned by the proposed model curriculum in its current form. This curriculum was drafted by a group with a lot of ideological baggage that should not be dumped on our students. Specifically, the sections about capitalism, BDS, and the Arab-Israeli conflict convey an extreme bias that should not be taught to our children as accepted facts. Furthermore, the lack of any discussion of anti-Semitism is quite troubling as well. We hope very much that this curriculum will undergo major changes when reviewed by the State Board of Education, if not scrapped altogether.
