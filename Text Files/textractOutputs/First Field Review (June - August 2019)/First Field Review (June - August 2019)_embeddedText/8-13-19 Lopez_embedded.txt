From: Jorge Lopez Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: RE Perpetuating racism
The courses model and descriptions for this program is ill witted and filled with patrconistic white guilt fueled mentality top down.
One of the mindsets that this curriculum claims that it will address is exactly what it will do to young impressionable minds and that is to view the historical context of ethnic studies as a blame game led by white guilt . This is oppression because it will be usually white teachers leading the discussions around these matters and that will perpetuate what we see too much in schools now; teachers telling students what to think rather than teaching them HOW to think.
These talks and lessons, which at one point in the historical context of most persons of color, were led by elders who spoke of stories and lessons of a people through the years- told by us for us.
Instead; the coursework as it stands now will teach victimhood and handout mentality that has destroyed many communities through the generations. Where is the conversations about the welfare system, single parenting and drug usage at? Where are the facts about black on black and brown on brown crime? Are these not serious issues in our community?
The fact that CDE will require a teaching credential and all of the hoops that come with that ridiculous process, to teach these courses, guarantees that these lessons will be taught by predominantly white people, same as with most other courses, and isn't that the overall point Ethnic Studies states it will address? Are we creating the legitimacy of young white liberal and progressive recent college graduates to take deeply complex matters, and allowing them to distort for their idealism?
As written- we are!
