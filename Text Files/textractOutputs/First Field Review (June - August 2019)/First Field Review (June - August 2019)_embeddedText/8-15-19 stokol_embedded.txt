Re: Public Input �2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
"General" - comments that apply to the entire curriculum document.
My comments follow regarding the inclusion of discussion of the BDS movement in the proposed curriculum.
The high school curriculum must emphasize the value of inclusion and tolerance.
The BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement is the opposite of that, as it is - divisive, - promotes hate (against Israel as a country, and against Israelis as individuals), - is a thinly disguised attack on Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state,
Ancient conflicts should not be brought into our schools.
Irrespective of the legitimacy of any group's grievances or aspirations, discussion of the BDS movement and promoting it in any way has no place in a high school curriculum.
The curriculum should not be manipulated, slanted, seen or believed to be "taking sides" or furthering the political goals of specific curriculum creators regarding this, or any other conflict for that matter.
There is no role for politicization of the curriculum in our schools, especially as the impressionable adolescent audience is easily manipulated and is not in a position to evaluate all relevant factors.
Students would also not want to be perceived or actually be in conflict with a teacher authority figure, or be at risk of bullying or being ostracized by their student peers if there is disagreement.
Teachers should not be obligated to get into political discussions with which they may not agree, and potentially be in conflict with other teachers, the school administration or the parents of students who share a different perspective.
The entire atmosphere of the high school learning environment, which should promote inclusiveness and tolerance, may be adveresely affected.

I am requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. This concern is not restricted to Israel, but to politicization and taking sides in general in a school setting.
Respectfully submitted,
