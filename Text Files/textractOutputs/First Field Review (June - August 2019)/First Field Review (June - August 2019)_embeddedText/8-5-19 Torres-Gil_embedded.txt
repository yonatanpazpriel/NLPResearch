I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the

Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. (see

pages 2, 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269). In my lifetime, here, in

the U.S., Jews were prohibited from holding particular jobs

(corporate lawyer), restricted from attending universities through

quotas, the victims of hate crimes & synagogue shootings � right

here in California.
