I write to express grave reservations about the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum There is something drastically wrong with a document summarizing aspects of ethnicity that acknowledges the biases suffered by ethnic groups that completely ignores antisemitism. In the glossary islamophobia is defined but antisemitism is ignored. This although, according to the FBI, antisemitic incidents far outnumber anti-muslim incidents. This reflects a purposeful bias on the part of the drafters of the document and a disconnect with reality. It appears that the only acknowledgment of Jews as an ethnic group is to attack Israel by detailed reference to the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement which is widely perceived as antisemitic (the German parliament passed a resolution recognizing this) and a drastically biased account of the Arab-Israeli conflict. In summary, I find the document embodies a gross distortion of the notion of ethnicity, an attempt at proselytizing instead of educating, a gross irresponsibility with facts, and an absence of any fair-mindedness. I would appreciate it if this letter were included in the record of public impute .
Yours Sincerely Leonard Horwitz
