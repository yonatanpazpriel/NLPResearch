From: Lisa Lainer Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:10 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on your Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
To Whom it May Concern, As a private citizen, parent of three children and proud Jew I am incredibly disappointed to hear about and read through your ethnic studies curriculum. I am saddened and shocked to see such blatant anti-semitism.
I urge the State of California to create and add curriculum lessons about American jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. it would also be useful to add to your curriculum the truth about israel, a country where all people, regardless of their gender, sexual orientation, race, or creed are welcomed and treated with respect.
Please see the attached form detailing my objections to your curriculum. Please contact me directly so that I can know how you plan to redesign this curriculum to be more truthful and honest .
Thank you, Lisa Lainer

If you are going to address and give credence to the BDS Moment it is imperative that you also explain how BDS sanctions, supports and promotes hate, division and violence against Jews. In addition, your curriculum must include the history of the Jewish people both within a general historical model and within the US. Specifically, we must teach that the US did Not welcome Jews in the early 1900s, and that as a people they have been singled out for no reason and have been the target of virulent anti-semitism.

I am shocked that your curriculum is so blatantly anti-Semitic! Do you have any intention on focusing you attention in the same way on the jewish community in the US? What about including the history of Jewish persecution throughout ALL of history? What about addressing jews who fled Eastern Europe during the holocaust? What about the reality that in Israel all ethnicities, genders, religions etc are welcome where this is certainly not true in the Arab world?
