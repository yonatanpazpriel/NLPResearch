Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The current proposed curriculum to satisfy AB 2016 and AB 331 was created by the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee.
The proposed curriculum is bigoted, biased, and broken. Instead of promoting inclusivity, this curriculum encourages divisiveness by exploiting the crisis on the border, denigrating the memory of 9/11, and manipulating the struggles of African Americans to deliver anti-Israel and antisemitic messages.

It should not be passed. Thank you.
