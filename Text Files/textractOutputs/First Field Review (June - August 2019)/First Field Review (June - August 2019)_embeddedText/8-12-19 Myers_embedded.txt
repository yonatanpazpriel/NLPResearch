From: Sara Myers Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 4:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Tony Thurmond Subject: Feedback regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
Thank you for making the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum available for public comment. I am concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, however, I ask that you consider making revisions consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I have a daughter entering her freshman year in high school and a son who will enter high school in a few years. Among many other qualities, traits, and interests, my children are Jewish. As was so aptly stated by the Calif. Legislative Jewish Caucus, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community." In light of rising antisemitism in America, especially on college campuses, I fear that this content might put their safety in jeopardy.
Specific items of concern include the omission of Jews from ethnic groups mentioned and the fact that Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination, even though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews. Israel also receives sharp criticism in the draft curriculum, with little background information about the history of the Israel. If you are attempting to eliminate prejudice, the viewpoints, music lyrics, and language used should be done in a manner that is "balanced", "inclusive", and reflective of "different perspectives".
I request you to make major revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Sara Myers
