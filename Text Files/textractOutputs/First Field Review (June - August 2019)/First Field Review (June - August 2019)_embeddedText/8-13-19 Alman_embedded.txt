From: askisadora Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Do not forget jews in the new studies AB331
Dear Committee:
It is my understanding that Jews are not being covered fairly, or at all, in this new program of AB331. It's imperative that this minority is added and added fairly, in the program. Knowledge of the Holocaust and rising antiSemitism worldwide demands equal time and fair representation in schools' curriculum.
