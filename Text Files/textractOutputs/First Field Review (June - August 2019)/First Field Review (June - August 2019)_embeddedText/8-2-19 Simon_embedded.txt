Note that Israel has been in Hebrew prayer books ever since the printing press was invented. The country has been evolving since 1948 and 1967. After the Six Day War,Israel wanted to return the captured lands for peace but the meeting in Khartoum rejected Israel's offer. Since then, Israel has had to face terrorist attacks and stabbings on a regular basis. Given the actions of the population of Gaza, It's difficult to imagine Israel returning the West Bank to the Palestinians. Please don't be too hard on the Israelis, it's difficult to get peace when the other side wants to destroy you.
