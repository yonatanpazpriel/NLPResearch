Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Despite curriculum's preoccupation with the Middle East, it omits to mention centuries of 2nd-class subjection, persecutions and expulsions of Jews who were native for millennia in Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, the Maghreb (North Africa).
The description of BDS is, by the Glossary's description, an Ideology, i.e. "a set of beliefs of a particular school of thought," a Political Ideology. It is not Fact, but assumed, believed. It declares a Political Opinion as Absolute Truth, discouraging Critical Thinking. It discourages Cultural Understanding of how Israelis have struggled for 71 years to establish a just and equal society. It disempowers Israeli immigrant students, dehumanizing their country of Origin, depriving them of human qualities. It encourages negative attitudes towards all Jews which attitudes have inspired centuries of hate crimes and persecution of an Ethnic Minority by majority populations. It fails to promote a "humanistic and loving approach to Ethnic Studies" as mandated by General Principles of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines.

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Six Million Jews were killed by genocide by white supremacists from 1938 � 1945. One would think this would merit your intense attention in a humanistic and loving approach to teaching Ethnic Studies. Giant Omissions: Glossary lacks "Antisemitism" and "Holocaust" � that is truly bizarre. Also lacking: rigorous analysis of the History of Jew-Hatred and its extraordinary consequences in your parents' lifetimes. ANTI-Critical Thinking � no thinking at all � just BELIEVE and DO as instructed.
Encourages False Analogy � Transparent Political Ideology - dehumanizes Israelis, and, soon all Jews, and anyone else who thinks Israelis should determine what they need to do to protect themselves against missiles and suicide bombers. Omits fact that wealthy Arabs left voluntarily early, anticipating war, and encouraged poorer Arabs to do the same. Ambiguous cause of dispersal.
