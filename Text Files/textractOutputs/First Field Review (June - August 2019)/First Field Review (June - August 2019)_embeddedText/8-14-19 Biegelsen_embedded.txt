From: Charlotte Biegelsen Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 11:01 AM To: Superintendent Subject: Ethnic Studies
Dear Instructional Quality Commission, I was shocked and alarmed to hear and see the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. It is with appreciation and relief that I have also seen the letter from the State Board of Education referring to the proposed curriculum. With acts of anti-Semitism clearly on the rise and the chant that "Jews will not replace us" loud and clear in Charlottesville, it would be more than a serious error to omit study of anti-Semitism in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Thank you for looking carefully at this matter. Sincerely, Charlotte Biegelsen
