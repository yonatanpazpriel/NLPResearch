Dear Instructional Quality Commission,
I don't have Microsoft Word, so I apologize for not using your template. But I did notice in the Overview in line 306-308 that only capitalism is mentioned as being oppressive. People escaped here because they were trying to get away from the oppression of other isms. My own parents escaped from Communism. I remember a classmate in elementary school who escaped on a boat from a Communist country in Asia (don't recall which anymore), but his mother died in the process!
I strongly feel that to give kids wisdom, you need to address the oppression of all systems. No system is perfect. But capitalism is the system people are escaping to, so we must be doing something right.
Thank you for this opportunity to comment.
