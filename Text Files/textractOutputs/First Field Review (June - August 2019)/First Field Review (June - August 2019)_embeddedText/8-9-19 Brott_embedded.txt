From: June Brott Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:54 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Hijacked ethnic studies
I will have two grandchildren in Dublin Hgh and I am angry and distressed at the thought that some members of the ethnic studies planner have deliberate decide to substitute their personal biases with the goal of brainwashing children.
Each of those individuals should be fired for a blatant attempt to substitute propaganda for facts. Their own `ethics' are questionable.
I am grateful that the biased items did not go to print yet. If not caught, California's department of education would suffer a besmirched reputation.
Sincerely,
June S. Brott Walnut Creek 94595
