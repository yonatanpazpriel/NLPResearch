Dear CRIFD Personnel:
Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
We are supporters of this type of education but feel it needs to be balanced in its outlook and in this cases ignores historic anti-Semitism (both in U.S. and globally) and does not give credence to the refusal of Hamas and others to give any kind of legitimacy to Israel's right to exist.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Yours, Bob and Arlene Lapidus
