From: Liz Murray Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 12:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please support all CA students with Ethnic Studies curriculum
I am writing in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that has been prepared by an advisory committee and that will be advanced on August 15th, 2019. It is critical that all students see themselves in the curriculum and that all students learn their own history and the history of others. Without a commitment to transformative Ethnic Studies the default rests the hegemonic model that promotes a White, middle-class perspective, a perspective that leaves out so many Californian students. Ethnic studies has been tied to higher graduation rates for Students of Color and it also supports the mental health of Students of Color. Please listen to the advisory committee and keep the curriculum as they have advanced it.
Sincerely, Liz Murray Teachers 4 Social Justice, San Francisco, CA
