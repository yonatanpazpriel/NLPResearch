From: spg1505 Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS point of view
To whom it may concern, I have become aware to my dismay, that there is a proposal to teach CA children about Islamophobia, and not anti Semitism, BDS , and other topics which present Israel in a negative light, as a colonial entity. This is totally inappropriate and should be terminated. This curriculum should be discussed in an open forum. I would like to know who proposed and supported this one sided proposed curriculum.
