From: Patrick Velasquez Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Support for ethnic studies legislation
Dear Sirs/Madams:
I write on behalf of the San Diego Chicano/Latino Concilio on Higher Education, a coalition of alumni, faculty, staff, and students from higher education institutions in San Diego. For over thirty years, we have advocated for access, success, and meaningful learning for Chicano/Latino students in higher education.
We strongly support the proposed state legislation that would make mandatory that all California high school as well as California State University students take at least one ethnic studies course as part of their graduation requirements. Indeed, more than one such course is needed by all students that might plan to develop their careers and lives in our increasingly diverse state. A considerable body of academic scholarship documents the effectiveness of such courses in contributing to positive educational outcomes for all students.
Although future refinements of the proposed curricula might be needed, we strongly support the passage of this legislation as soon as possible.
Sinceramente,
Patrick Velasquez, Ph.D. Co-Chair, San Diego Chicano/Latino Concilio on Higher Education
