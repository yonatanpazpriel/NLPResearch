From: Alex Aliferis Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 9:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments on Economics
Dear California Department of Education,
On the subject of economics, it is described as a "form of power and oppression" alongside patriarchy, racism, and white supremacy.
I urge you to delete this section and words.
It appears as if Capitalism and capitalists appear as bad several times.
Why is Economics in Ethnic Studies? Ethnic Studies is the study of ethnic cultural identities like Polish, Filipino, Russian, Zulu, Chinese, Indians of Mexico, etc.
Also, capitalism is used across the world like Asia. Are Koreans white supremacists because they have a Free Market Capitalist system? What about Japan? What about Dubai? What about Ghana?
The ethnic studies needs to follow cultural education and not go into competing economic theories and misinterpretation.
Thank you,
Alex Aliferis
