[Include the page and line number(s) here�Write your comment here] I am deeply disturbed by the one-sided exploration of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am also troubled by the omission of any discussion of the history of Jewish immigration to the U.S. including the rejection of those trying to escape the Holocaust. During this time of rising acts of anti-Semitism, it is unfathomable that it is not even mentioned.
P.1 - omission of anti-Semitism p.2 - definition of BDS presents only the Palestinian viewpoint which ultimately aims for the destruction of the State of Israel P.234 � a call to honor BDS as if it is the only righteous action to take
P.237 � the identification of a country called "Israel-Palestine" rather than Israel and the Palestinian Authority

p.242 � use of the terms "Nakba" and "1948 Palestine War" with no mention of Israel's War of Independence. There is no information regarding the ancient connection of Jews to Israel, their constant presence, and the legality of the establishment of the modern State of Israel. There is also no mention of the repeated failures of peace talks. Both positions need to be presented and explored so that students get a balanced view and can draw their own conclusions.
