I find it difficult to believe that this committee could produce such a poor , verbose , unclear and poorly drafted group of documents . Whatever you are trying to say is not being said clearly , briefly and concisely . Whole sections of the introduction are wordy , confused and not at all concise.
All of you are educators . Have your really discussed , vetted and simplified what you are trying to say ? In addition there is political nonsense in the introduction that is not appropriate for what should be an unbiased approach and promotes teaching students to become idealogical activists and proponents of identity politics . With our current administration in Washington , the last thing that we need is a policy that emphasizes division based on classification.
Quite frankly , if this draft were my work product , I would be embarrassed beyond measure . You guys are educators , all appointed by the state . All of you are involved in the ethnic studies field . Can't you produce a concise and clear work product . Sadly ,the commentary in the WSJ article , page A17. George and Sharon Orff Laguna Beach
Cottie , I think you need to get involved .
