Dear California Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,
As a grassroots organization we have been concerned with the education of youth of color since the passing of Proposition 187 (1994) when we organized and were founded. We have reviewed the entirety of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum; all four chapters and the appendices. We find the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to be appropriate to be provided as a model for California Ethnic Studies educators. We believe that it should be a more thorough framework but understand that AB2016 only funded a limited model curriculum that we support. We understand that school sites can use it as it is, borrow from it and adapt, or develop their own based on the needs and demographics of their schools. The ESMC is as we understand it, simply a model of what could be used and not a mandatory curriculum. Therefore, we are publically commenting that we are in support of the 2020 Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely,
Membership and Governing Board of A.R.E. Association of Raza Educators, Los Angeles
