From: Maya Mackrandilal Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Support 2020 Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern, I am writing in support of the 2020 Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. This curriculum was developed by knowledgeable classroom educators and experts in the field and reflects content that is vital to the education of young people in California. I ask that legislators respect the integrity of the field, which was created to center the struggles of people of color. It is not necessary to insert narratives from white-identified communities into the curriculum for the sake of "balance." These narratives are already covered in other content areas throughout students' educational life. Ethnic Studies is a small gesture towards "balance" - presenting a counternarrative to the white-dominant narratives that students encounter. I would also ask that important terms like "cisheteropatriarchy" and "womxn" continue to be included - the spurious claim that young people would not be able to connect with "academic" language (that is often actually language that came directly from community activism) is infantilizing and ignores the presence of this language in teen-oriented publications (like Teen Vogue) and on social media. Young people lead rich and sophisticated lives, and our educational materials should live up to their needs and expectations, not the biases of older people.
Thank you,
