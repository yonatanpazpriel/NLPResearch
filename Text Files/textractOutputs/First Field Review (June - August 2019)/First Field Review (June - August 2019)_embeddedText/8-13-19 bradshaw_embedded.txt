To whom it may concern,
I strongly oppose this "curriculum" which is very biased and anti-Semitic in nature. Promoting the BDS Movement - which the US government has opposed as biased - is unconscionable, as is the use of deceptive and untrue terms such as "Palestinians living under apartheid conditions," and offering blatant lies against Israel.
There is no mention of anti-Semitism or Jewish Americans (who are clearly a minority in America, and Asian in origin) ... except to mention that "Israel and Jewish supporters are part of interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that must be fought with direct action and resistance."
You should be ashamed to promote such an anti-Jewish program at a US educational institution.
I ask you to try and be unbiased and to remove this curriculum from consideration.
