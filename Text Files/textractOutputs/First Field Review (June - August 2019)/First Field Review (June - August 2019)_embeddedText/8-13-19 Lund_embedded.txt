From: Kathy Lund Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies proposed curriculum
I am adamantly opposed to this proposal. It is racist and anti-Semite. You can do better. To what end does the curriculum bash Capitalism? That is what made America great!
Stop with the not-so-subtle indoctrination of our children to the liberal mindset and ideology. Facts. Just proven facts. All you need. All they need.
Leave the politics out.
