The whole thing is a bunch of Liberal propaganda and should be thrown away. It is no wonder that test scores keep going down. Adoption of this will lead to the end of public schools as parents send their children to private and charter schools to learn English, Math, and History (not Herstory or Hexrstory). Pg. 11 Line 245.. `Ethnic Studies should be an essential core component of every students' K�12 education experience.' I thought that English, Math, History, and Science were the core subjects. What kind of job requires ethnic studies?
1. Pg. 13 Lines 298 � 315. `cultivate empathy, community actualization, cultural
perpetuity, self-worth, self-determination, and the holistic well-being of all participants,
especially Native People/s and people of color;
2. celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of color by providing a space
to share their stories of struggle and resistance, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth;
3. center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial, and
marginalized knowledge;

4. critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society;
5. challenge imperialist/colonial hegemonic beliefs and practices on the ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized levels;
6. connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels to ensure a truer democracy; and
7. conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for post-imperial life that promotes collective narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radical healing.1'

This is just Brain Washing and dividing students by ethnic groups. It is wrong and will continue the trend that Asian students score best and black students score worst on the SAT tests. Pg. 18 Line 247. `Their projects need to influence, educate, advocate or speak truth to power. For
example, if students decide they want to advocate for voting rights for undocumented immigrant residents at the school district or city elections, they can develop arguments in favor of such a city
ordinance and then plan a meeting with their city council person or school board member.' You are suggesting that students should advocate for allowing criminals to vote. This is over the top for me. I do not want my taxes used to support such propaganda. Just keep teaching the white history that made our country great and the envy of the world.
