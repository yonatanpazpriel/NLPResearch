The Jewish people are a minority in the United States. Anti Semitism is on the rise. There is no mention of including the Jewish people as a minority nor as a targeted group for racism and worse. This exclusion begins as early as in the introduction of the model curriculum.
The curriculum's definition and bias regarding the Palestinian viewpoint in general and the BDS movement in particular is extremely troubling. The presentation is pro BDS with no objective description of an anti BDS argument(pg 234). Also objectionable is equating Israeli anti-terrorist activities with USMexico struggles at our border (pg 234).
