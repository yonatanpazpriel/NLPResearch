From: Sherry Kroop Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Kenneth McDonald Subject: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft
Dear Committee I am writing to express my outrage and total disapproval of this proposed curriculum. As a mother, grandmother, Jewish woman and social liberal who embraces tolerance and acceptance of all races, ages, religions, sexual identities and ethnicities, I find this curriculum to do the exact OPPOSITE of its stated intent. Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature any lessons on antisemitism, a problem which is ever rising in our society
right now.
It is obvious that this curriculum, with its anti Semitic slant and lack
of balance is a deliberate attempt to fan the flames of hatred against Jews,
thus creating a climate of hatred, rejection and bullying against Jewish
students in our California public schools.
My reasons are as follows:
Implying that "Israel-Palestine" (no such country) is an Arab country

Page 234, lines 4956-4958 � This section: � Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct
Action for Palestine but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from
entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico.
Page 242, lines 5157-5161 � This section:  Framing the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative
perspectives.
this Is is particularly outrageous:
Page 256, lines 5477-5494, pages 264-270, lines 5692-5830 � These sections:  That teachers are encouraged to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public - a common, and quintessential, antisemitic slur.

For all of these reasons, I say California resident and voter, as well as a former educator myself, I am asking that this curriculum Be modified to represent American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East. Furthermore, I call on you to create safeguards that will prevent similar bias and omissions in this and other California state curriculums going forward.
Thank you for your attention to this request
Very truly yours
Sherry Kroop
