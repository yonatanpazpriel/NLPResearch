In looking at this overall unit, I can't think of something that would be more divisive to our country in creating a victim culture among people. The U.S. is a great country that has made it possible for all people to succeed and thrive. This curriculum seems to want to tear down all the traditions that have made America great including our free market economy which has enabled more people to be pulled out of poverty than any other economic system. The ethnic studies field seems to want to even tear down basic rules of spelling. This king of class will create more strife and hatred not less.
