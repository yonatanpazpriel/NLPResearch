To: Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education:
I am writing to express my concern about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I certainly support the intended goal of this program, it is deeply upsetting that the curriculum does not offer a balanced view of Judaism and Israel. As it stands, the curriculum contains pro BDS bias and antisemitic tropes. I urge you to make revisions to the ESMC curriculum consistent with the recommendations for the California Legislative Jewish Caucus Letter.
Thank you for you attention to this very important matter.
Sincerely, Wendy Davis
