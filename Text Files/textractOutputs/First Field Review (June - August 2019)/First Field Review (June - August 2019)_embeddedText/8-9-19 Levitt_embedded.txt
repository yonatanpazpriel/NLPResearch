Dear Gentlemen and Ladies WHO HAVE CREATED THIS Tissue of Lies:
I ask that you please revise the ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM For the State of California which I understand is close to be voted on. It is Anti-Israel, ANTISEMITIC and ProPalestinian!
I, as a Jew am appalled by the fact that you have erased JEWISH EXPERIENCE in the United States. You have practically nullified the Jewish existence as a people, in America! Jews have been in the United States since before there was a United States. There were 2,500 Jews in America at the time of American- Independence from Britain with 100 Jews in the Revolutionary War, There were Jews fighting in the 1st WW and in WWII. America very early on in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights enshrined FREEDOM OF RELIGION And you know that Hayim Solomon practically supported GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON'S ARMY of the Revolution SINGLEHANDEDLY; and died bankrupt since he was not paid back the $350,000 that was owed to him by the fledgling Colonial Government.
ISRAEL is the only Democracy in the Middle East! There is religious tolerance or acceptance in Israel for all religions! The omission of the Jewish experience is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on College Campuses! The ESMC omits ANTISEMITISM , but includes all other intolerance perpetrated on American Citizens. This is inconsistent with and contrasts with the attention devoted to Islamophobia! The most recent FBI statistics show that there were 931 incidents of Antisemitism recorded this year, contrasting to 275 instances of anecdotal Islamophobia. . The Curriculum you proposes denigrates ISRAEL and Jews, and gives support to the Antisemitic and destructive BDS Movement directed at ISRAEL. BDS asks all governments, banks, universities and other institutions to withdraw monetary support from Israel and its companies:What about IRAN, CHINA. NORTH -KOREA, Turkey, Russia? Is the a global Movement to Boycott Sanction, Divest these Countries; And BDS asks for sanctions to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation,re trade and military agreements;. What about those OTHER COUNTRIES I mentioned, I didn't even bother to list the smaller ones; and Israel is smaller than all of the smallest Countries! It is only Antisemitism that makes such a small country, such a target for ostracism!

BDS IS AN Antisemitic Movement that has as its goal. the eradication of Israel! Omar Barghouti, its Founder admitted as much. Germany has recognized BDS as antisemitic! The U.S. Congress has passed repeated resolutions condemning BDS. The most recent resolution in July, 2019 received overwhelming bipartisan support and passed: 398-17!
Former GOVERNOR, JERRY BROWN OF CALIFORNIA on September 24, 2016 signed into Law California Assembly Bill 2844, requiring those who enter into contracts with state agencies to certify that the are not involved in activities that violate the' Unruh Civil Rights Act' which includes support for the BDS Movement and its Programs!
ANTISEMITISM is totally missing from your Glossary! However, BDS is described favorably. It says that BDS is a global, social movement. What bosh! Omar Barghouti would like it to be!
How can the enlightened American State of California, perpetrate Antisemitism and Anti-Israel sentiments under the pretense that those who wrote this ETHNIC STUDY are being evenhanded IN this one-sided scurrilous endeavor!
