Dear Board of Education,
My name is Julie Ovadia and I was born and raised in Oakland California. We moved to Lafayette California where my children benefited from education in our local public schools so it is of great concern when I heard about the the new curriculum being considered.
Don't we have enough hate mongering in this world without perpetuating it amongst our children and sanctioning it in our school district? School is a place to learn facts, not opinions especially ones based on bias and hate. The language presented is so off kilter and anti Semitic that it is hard to believe it is even being considered at all! How safe do you think this will make the Jewish students feel in an environment already rife with hate and fear?
Leaders of this BDS movement have an stated agenda ending the existence of the State of Israel, and have very little interest in honestly educating our children ï¿½ I DO NOT WANT this in my schools.... PERIOD
Thanks for reading and hopefully listening,
Roni and Julie Ovadias
