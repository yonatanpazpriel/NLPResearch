CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education,
That reasonable people across the political spectrum have to petition you, that Jews have to petition you, to not put in place a flagrantly anti-Semitic curriculum is a disgrace.
Dump this curriculum, fire everybody that worked on it, and start over.
Yours truly,
Robert G. Silverman Brooklyn, NY
