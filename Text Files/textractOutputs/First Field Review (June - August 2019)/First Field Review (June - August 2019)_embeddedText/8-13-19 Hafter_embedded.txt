From: Joanna Hafter Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Oppose Anti Israel Hate Curriculum
To the California Department of Education/Instructional Quality Commission and to Those this may Concern:
I am a former teacher and parent of a student at Capuchino High School in San Bruno. I am very concerned and upset about anti-semetic and anti Israel content and course material throughout the ESMC. In politicizing the Israel-Palestenian conflict, the ESMC is polarizing and will divide students rather than bring them together. Please do not include anti-Israel sentiments in your curriculum.
Sincerely, Joanna Hafter San Bruno California
