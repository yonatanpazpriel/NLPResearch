Chapter 2-Social Movements-36/299
Hello:
As a retired teacher in the California system, it is a huge disappointment to me and other Jewish American teachers to read your proposed Model Ethnic Curriculum: You state when addressing social movements, "The purpose of the lesson is for students to learn, analyze and discuss current social movements happening both in the United States and abroad." One of the movements you refer to is BDS. I find it unfathomable that you haven't taken the time to review what each of these initials mean, and if you have we have a larger problem in our education system than I thought, and it needs to be investigated. B-boycott means a concerted effort by any person, organization, store to have any dealings with Israel. Ddivestment means to deprive Israel of any property, authority or title. S-sanction means an economic or military coercive measure adopted usually by several nations in concert for forcing a nation violating international law to desist or yield to adjudication".Merriam-Webster. What happens to a nation that is subject to these draconian measures? BDS by its very mandate wants Israel to fail and be eliminated as a nation, and this curriculum plans to teach your students about this movement without a single reference in your glossary or your appendix to Jewish history regarding the Palestinians and their intransigence to come to the negotiating table under four American Presidents. You also fail to make reference to Jewish history at large in this country and throughout the world for hundreds of years. You use the Univ. of CA Berkeley's Ethnic Studies Curriculum as a model, despite the fact that out of 15 permanent faculty members, there is only one that teaches Arab and Jews in diaspora. All the others represent African American, Native American, Chicano and Asian races. You concentrate on the color of people's skin i.e. whiteness as opposed to people of color as if this is some kind of badge of shame that Jews are stamped with. Yes, African Americans deserve reparations.Yes, they have been marginalized and yes, its high time this country did something about it. However, you focus on the plight of people of color in general, who are marginalized, but fail to even mention that Jews are more subject to more hate crimes than Muslims. Hate crimes

against Jews have risen by 37% in 2018 and account for half the religious hate crimes in this country. That's an outstanding statistic. You fail to mention how BDS has made it a living hell for Jewish college students to enjoy their college years, because of rants and hate crimes they are subject to. It's easy to use the Jewish tropes that Farrakhan and Ilhan Omar have used to marginalize and stoke fear and hate towards the Jewish population, but we're on to what this movement is trying to do. They may say they are anti Zionist, but that's code for Anti-Semitism. As an educator, I find your model curriculum a farce, suggested by people that have a larger interest, pitting people of color against Jews. A curriculum is supposed to be balanced and inclusive. You fail on both measures. It should not stand!
