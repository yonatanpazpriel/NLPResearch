Comment
While SBE's "Guidelines for Ethnic Studies Curriculum" specify that the Ethnic Studies curriculum is to "be inclusive, creating space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, or citizenship, to learn different perspectives," California law is considerably broader adding that "no person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of ... nationality [or] religion" in any "activity conducted by an educational institution" too. CA Education Code Section 220.
The SBE cannot adopt "any instructional materials...that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation..." and teachers cannot "give instruction ... that promotes a discriminatory bias" on the basis of these groups. CA Education Code Sections 51501 and 51500.
"Descriptions, depictions, labels, or rejoinders that tend to demean, stereotype, or patronize minority groups are prohibited." "Instructional materials containing references to, or illustrations of, people must portray accurately, to the extent possible, the roles and contributions of a fair proportion of diverse ethnic groups, especially" Native Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and European Americans." "CA Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content."
This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised: The two songs included both disparage Israel, the world's only Jewish state, and thereby discriminate on the basis of nationality

Suggested revision: Eliminate these songs and choose other materials that do not consistently delegitimize Israel. One song that is recommended would be "Diaspora" by Young Gravy, a young Jew of color:
