To Whom It May Concern,
The proposed "model curriculum" is factually wrong and inherently biased. As a California citizen, I am outraged at this proposal and disgusted that our public institutions would consider presenting blatant falsehoods to our impressionable children. The BDS movement is antiSemitic, and attempts to whitewash its history at this time of increasing anti-Semitic violence is extraordinarily concerning. Please find further comments attached.
