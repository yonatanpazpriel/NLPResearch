2019-20 will be the third year of our local Ethnic Studies course which has been well received and is growing in enrollment. Our Social Studies Dept. Chair, Ms. Michelle Lau-Seim created and teaches our course, and could be a resource to the committee. Has the Committee attempted to reach out to teachers across the state who have been teaching this? They are a resource that shouldn't be neglected. Another resource is the students themselves who have taken the existing Ethnic Studies courses. They have already dealt with very difficult and divisive topics that the Committee is seeing right now. Connecting with these students, and incorporating a student-driven view, could help the Committee move forward. Here are comments from two Albany High students:

Student 1: Ethnic studies allows students to interact with multiple viewpoints and perspectives to further complete the understanding of the past. As a white student I liked the fact that I could take ethnic studies to further understand the way my privilege has been developed as well as understand the systems that have been created to oppress minority groups. I can then take this information and use it to my advantage in trying to make a change and become a better ally for people of color.

Student 2: What I liked most about ethnic studies was that each ethnic group was taught equally and fairly. No group over shined the other. It gives students great opportunity to learn about cultures and ethnic groups around them.

I agree with the Committee's Introduction to the Model Curriculum that this course is essential to 21st Century education, will increase inclusion in schools, and will prepare our students for success as responsible citizens in an increasingly diverse society.
