I am struck by the general exclusion of Jewish people from the curriculum, and mis-information and one-sided information regarding the arab-israeli conflict. There is barely a mention of Jewish people, and nothing about the long history if immigration here, the different communities of Jewish people in California and across the US. No discussion of anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, Israel as something other than "the displacement of arabs", etc. It is hurtful to read through the curriculum especially because (overt) anti-Semitism has been on the rise for the past few years and more and more people don't know what the Holocaust was or what it means to be Jewish. p.2. My comments apply here too, and to include a one-sided view of "BDS" is shameful. pp. 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269. Same comments. Makes me scared to live here that this would even be an option for the curriculum.
