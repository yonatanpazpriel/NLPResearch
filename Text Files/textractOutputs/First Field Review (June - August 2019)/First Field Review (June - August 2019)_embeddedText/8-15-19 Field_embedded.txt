From: I&H Field Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Current Draft Model of Proposed CA Curriculum
To Members of State Board of Education: I want to register my difference of opinion with the Proposed Draft and specifically the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I specifically refer to pages 234,242,256,265 & 267 among others that do not appear to be either even balanced nor accurate and urge you to reconsider the entire curriculum to provide an accurate picture for our children.
