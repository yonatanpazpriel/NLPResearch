Ethnic studies provide the education necessary for our children of color and white students the understanding of diversity. Diversity is the foundation of our beautiful country and provides a platform for unity and solidarity. Without the education of the roots and background of diversity, youhave left ignorance which feeds the racist hate that we see every day. The ignorance continues to the hate in which e all suffer from.
