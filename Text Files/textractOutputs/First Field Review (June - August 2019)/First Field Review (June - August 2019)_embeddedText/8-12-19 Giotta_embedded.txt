From: Vito Giotta Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 7:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposal to divide Americans
I find your entire proposal racist and divisive to all Americans. This type of bull is the same that the socialist, communist and democrats use to divide Americans so that our Republic can be removed and replace with a socialist model. You have put every minority group into a box with the white kids being bullied into aligning your views to make them feel like they have been given white privilege advantage viewing their race as suppressors of all others. You present only minority views none for white groups like Europeans broken done by nationalities and countries other than slapping them in the face. You have divided groups by religion but only explaining Islam not Christianity. You present Arabs/Muslims POST Sept. 11, 2001 in history not before WHY? Your division/ diversity course is BS from the ground up. This racist course must not be presented for use in the state of California or anywhere else in the world. The people who wrote this should be charged as racist and thrown in prison for trying to harm our children by turning them into racist. Throw it in the fire pit and burn it.
Sincerely Vito Giotta
