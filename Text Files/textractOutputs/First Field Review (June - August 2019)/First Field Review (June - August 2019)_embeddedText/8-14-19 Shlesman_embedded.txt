From: Ronald and Janet Shlesman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethnic studies curriculum
Please do not allow the current ethnic studies draft to pass as it is now written. There appears to be a built in bias against Jews and Israel and its omission of antisemitism. The curriculum is meant to help alleviate prejudice, not encourage it through bias.
Thank you, Concerned California citizens
