Ethnic Studies,
Thank you for the opportunity to provide you with feedback concerning the current draft of the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. You have done great work except for one item that must be corrected prior to adoption in fulfilment of AB 2016.
The current version of the curriculum portrays Jews in arguably antisemitic ways: working in contravention of other ethnic groups, arousing stereotypes of money and power, and explicitly excluding the Jewish people as an ethnic minority. The unprecedented rise in antisemitic attacks in the US and worldwide speaks against taking such as strange position in an ethnic studies curriculum.
What's more, as currently drafted, the model curriculum mentions Jews only four times, including an insinuation that Jews are responsible for Arab displacement after the "Nakba" when clearly this is the result of the attacks by the armies of Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Iraq, and others to prevent Jews from reestablishing their homeland as a nation-state. That Arab-Israeli war led the disposition of 600,000 Arabs from Israel to other parts of Palestine and the expulsion of 800,000 Jews from their homes in Arab countries, mostly to Israel. Any mention of dispositions of Arabs needs to mention the larger number of Jews dispossessed by Arabs and the underlying antisemitism taught by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem and his disciples in mosques.
Thank you in advance for correcting this draft to remove its antisemitic overtones and for including in the next draft explicit mention of the Jewish people as an ethnic group worthy of study.
Yours truly,
Prof. Eli Cohen
