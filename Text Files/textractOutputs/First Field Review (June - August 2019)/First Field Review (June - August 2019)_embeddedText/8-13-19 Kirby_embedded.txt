From: jeremy kirby Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: BDS removal from Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As a father of a high school student here in California, it pains me to hear that we are considering including information on the deplorable BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction) movement. Something that has its roots in Nazi Germany, as well as excluding Jews from ethnic groups. Having grown up in California and attended high school in the state, I am very aware of the prejudice geared towards Jewish students. To exclude the Jewish people, while attempting to delegitimize the country of Israel, is a farce. There are many Arab and Persian people living in both Israel and in California who practice Judaism and are themselves subjected to hostility.
Thank you for your time
