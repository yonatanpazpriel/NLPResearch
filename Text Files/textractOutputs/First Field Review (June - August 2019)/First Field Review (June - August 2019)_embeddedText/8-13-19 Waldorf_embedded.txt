From: Mel Waldorf Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: concerns about Ethnic Studies curriculum
I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum. My daughter has been the victim of repeated antisemitic threats and attacks in the Alameda Unified School District over the past three years. She has suffered through anonymous threatening texts wishing our whole family had been murdered by the Nazis, holocaust jokes, and so many swastikas that we've lost count. The AUSD Superintendent never took these events seriously, and the district has done little to support Jewish students in the district. Sadly, her story is not uncommon, with similar incidents affecting other students in our district and nearby districts throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.
Unfortunately, the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum as written will only make the situation for Jewish students in California more difficult than it already is. Not only does the curriculum ignore Jews as a minority, but throughout the section on Arab Americans there are numerous claims made that paint Jews and Israel in a harsh light, ignoring the great complexity of the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs.
We Jews are an ethnic minority that has suffered thousands of years of violence, and the violence and hatred is again on the rise. Please revise the curriculum to show equal respect to Jewish Californians as you do to Californians from other ethnic minorities.
Finally, here is a 2017 article about some of the antisemitism my daughter and other Jewish students experienced in California schools.
Sincerely, Mel Waldorf Alameda, California
