From: Jackie Kosecoff Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am a native Californian having lived in LA all my life. I attended LAUSC schools and then went to UCLA for my undergraduate and PhD degrees. We raised 4 kids in the LAUSD district and now have 3 grandkids who are approaching school age inside LAUSD. We are appalled by the anti-Semitic tenor of the proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and ask that it NOT be approved. We have submitted on the attached document examples from the Curriculum that give rise to our concerns.
We are supportive of culturally meaningful curriculum and understand it can have a positive impact on students. We also know that inflammatory statements and singling out just one group for negative inspective can cause lasting damage. We live in an era of intolerance. Please do not add to this with a curriculum that denigrates students with a Jewish identity.
Thanks,
Jacqueline Kosecoff
