I noticed with the new school curriculum, there is mention of BDS, and absolutely no mention of anti-semetism. BDS is a group that hurts Israel and Jews among the diaspora. There was mention of other minority groups, but not of Jews. We are a minority, and we are still persecuted.
Yes, Israel currently has a problem with its leadership, much as the United States has a problem with its leadership. Other countries realize our leadership problems isn't indicitive of those that live here, why are we injuring Israel (and with it, the Jewish people like me living outside Israel) with harmful rhetoric? BDS is not the way to go, and not mentioning anti-semetism is not the way to go.
