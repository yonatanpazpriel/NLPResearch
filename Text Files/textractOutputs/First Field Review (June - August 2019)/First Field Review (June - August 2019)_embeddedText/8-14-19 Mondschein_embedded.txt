Sirs & Mss., It has sadly come to my attention that the California Dept. of Education is currently considering an Ethnic Studies Curricula that is open to public comment and review until August 15 th. Sadly, because it seems that among other undisguisable tropes of Anti - Semitism presented as unbiased geopolitical observation; there is an anti - Israel poem that insinuates Jews control the media, there is virtually no mention of Jews as a minority ethnic group ( yes, we are a Semitic group ethnogenetically speaking ), the Divestment.... movement to sell off Israel investments and boycott Israeli products is evidently presented as a legitimate move to establish Palestinian Homeland claims, and yet no Jewish or Israeli perspective is presented. The course covers hate directed towards ethnic groups BUT NOT ANTI - SEMITISM. As a Jew and a taxpayer my objections only begin here. I am all for political dialogue from all perspectives being presented in public schools. BUT, presenting dialogue perspective as the unopposed truth, maligning Jews with the ' they own/control the media', trope is the CDE supporting the very hate and prejudice it allegedly seeks to educate people about. As I said, my objections only begin here. If this curricula is instituted it can only end in expensive yet justifiable litigation. Please don't spend the money on litigation, spend it on education established only by the truth. Sincerely, Daniel Mondschein
