From: Lilac Road Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:18 PM To: Kenneth McDonald Subject: PROPOSED ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
Hello,
First - the CDE has made it very difficult for the average person to comment on this proposed curriculum.
Second - We want out children to be educated to the best of our ability. Science -, Mathermatics, Language, the ability to read, write and speak well. Our kids need to be prepared to compete in the world. We need to keep our subjective views of politics out of the classroom. Our kids deserve an EDUCATION not and INDOCTRINATION I oppose the proposed curriculum.
thank you for your time. Amy W Knitter
