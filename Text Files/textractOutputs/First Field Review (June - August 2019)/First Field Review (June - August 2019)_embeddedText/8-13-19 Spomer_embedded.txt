From: m Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:24 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Include Anti-Semitism into the ESMC Model Curriculum
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education
I live in California and care a lot about educating our youth about diversity and inclusion of all types. It was brought to my attention that your proposed ESMC curriculum fails to discuss antisemitism. I'm very concerned about any proposed curriculum that does not address negative stereotypes about Jews and/or Israelis. It has been brought to my attention that State of Israel is singled out and criticized.ï¿½ This is not right.
I urge you to positively and actively address the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others who are also calling for change.
Any discussion of religious, cultural or national inclusion needs to include Anti-Semitism and discuss the long time persecution of Jews that continues today.
An Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum MUST not favor bias to any political, national, religious or cultural freedoms and not address ALL issues of discrimination, and should not favor any political agenda or opinion.
Please do not approve this curriculum as it stands. Address these concerns.
