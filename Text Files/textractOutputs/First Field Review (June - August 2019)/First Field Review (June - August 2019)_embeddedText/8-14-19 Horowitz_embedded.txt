As a retired educator with over 50 years in both public and Jewish education, I find it disturbing to read about the exclusion of Israel from the CA curriculum. The decision smacks from political operatives who would deny the Jews place in history. Since the creation of the state of Israel, the world has seen an arid nation bloom, scientific and technological advancements made for the benefit of the world, and a people dedicated to learning and helping others. Just look at who the first responders are when there is a world catastrophe!! Shame on the state of CA and its lawmakers.
