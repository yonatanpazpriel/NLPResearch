From: Raphael Bivas Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Opinion on curriculum change
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of there being an ethnic studies class but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
With rising anti-Semitism, it seems wrong-headed to develop a curriculum that not only recognizes anti-Semitism as a form of discrimination and hatred, but that perpetuates antiSemitic tropes and describes the Middle Eastern conflict with a decidedly anti-Israel bias. Additionally, as the son of a Jewish refugee from Egypt, I also object to the omission of references to the Mizrahi Jewish community, even though they are well represented among California's Jewish population.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Raphael Bivas
