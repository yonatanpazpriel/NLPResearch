Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply distressed by the proposed, unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
In our 9 years in a California public schools district, my children have all encountered some form of anti-semitism in their public schools, from swastikas to one boy insisting he "loves Hitler and hates Jews".
Given the rise of anti-semitism at California public and some private universities, my kids have already determined they will not feel safe on these campuses and will need to apply elsewhere.
From what I understand about the:
� Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religiousbased hate crimes in the United States are against Jews
� The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective
� The curriculum presents a clearly one-sided discussion of the Arab-Israeli conflict that denigrates both Israel and Jews
� The curriculum includes a song with language that suggests Jews control the media!
Why is an ethnic studies curriculum, meant to teach students about marginalized communities, be used to promote a campaign of hate against Israel and to further marginalize students like my children.
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Melissa Baumwald
