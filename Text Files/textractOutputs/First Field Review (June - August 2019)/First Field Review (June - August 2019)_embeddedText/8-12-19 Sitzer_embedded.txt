Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am upset by the flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I currently work in the Palo Alto Unified School District and see firsthand how important balanced teaching is. I saw it is the California history and U.S. history units. Students often here little or family bias at home. So it is IMPERATIVE that the schools present UNBIASED information.
I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Melinda L. Sitzer 8/12/19
