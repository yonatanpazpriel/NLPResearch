To: Members of the Instructional Quality Commission
This proposed curriculum presents a very biased viewpoint on otherwise neutral categories such as capitalism, housing, environment and critical thinking. This curriculum attempts to impose a particular ideological viewpoint on children, rather than presenting them with facts and different ways of looking at those facts. Evaluation of different viewpoints is what critical thinking is, not activism. Alternative viewpoints are missing from this curriculum. For example, the list of influential figures to the AfricanAmerican and Latino communities are very controversial. Many of them have a long history of violent behavior. Their influence should not be presented without also acknowledging both their good and bad actions. Capitalism is a race-neutral economic system, but this curriculum treats it as a tool of oppression. Although this curriculum is designed to teach about the experiences of non-white people, it leaves out the incredible success many such people have had in the system of capitalism. Furthermore, the housing crisis was a complicated financial situation that is still being debated among talented economists. To teach it as an example of racism misses out on the most important lessons to take away from the policies that led to that crisis. This curriculum will teach students half-truths and lies about these very important topics. It will not do any of them any good and it will undermine the important critical thinking skills necessary to become a success in life and live among people from different races and backgrounds. Please do not approve the use of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
