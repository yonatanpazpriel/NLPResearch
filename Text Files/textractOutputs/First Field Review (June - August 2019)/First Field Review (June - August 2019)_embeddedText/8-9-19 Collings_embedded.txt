From: mrmentor Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:57 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: 'Desiree Collings' Subject: A vote to rewrite the proposed Ethics Studies curriculum
My name is Jim Collings; a proud lifetime resident of California.
I am eminently thankful for my childhood education in Pico Rivera, CA and of my extraordinary experiences while a student at Stanford University. What were you folks thinking when this curriculum was created? Did you not think this would be opposed by any and all fair minded, concerned, educated parents; and anyone else who cares about actual History? The facts matter...Please take the current politics and theoretical psychology out of the school's curriculum! Education should be unbiased and not a cheap excuse for propaganda, or someone's personal "cause"! Certainly, you would agree that political grandstanding has no place in our children's classroom. Please use your power and God given talents to rewrite this thing, or simply start over.
Sincerely, James Collings
