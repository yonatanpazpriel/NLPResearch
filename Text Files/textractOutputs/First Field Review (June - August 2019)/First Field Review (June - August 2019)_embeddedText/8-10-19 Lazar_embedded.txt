From: Dr.Lazar Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 8:55 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Anti-Semitism in California's public schools-badly flawed new California curriculum for high school students
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am seriously concerned by the outrageously flawed and unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. While I wholeheartedly support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
You have heard and will continue to hear from others who feel just as I do. If you fail to fix the curriculum and it remains in its current dastardly anti-Semitic/antiIsraeli format, you cannot fail to recognize that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is so unfairly slanted so as to cause ongoing inter-ethnic strife, religious intolerance, discrimination and even violence within your school system and some particular California communities.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Martin L. Lazar, MD, FACS Dallas, TX
