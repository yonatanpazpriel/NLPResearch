I am writing to share our alarm and concern over the current version of the state's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). We urge the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to make substantial revisions to the curriculum to ensure it meets the goals of the ESMC's authorizing statute AB 2016 (Chapter 327 of the Statutes of 2016) to "
pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple prepar[e]
cultures."
I am shocked by the proposed ESMC's manifest indifference, and even hostility, to the American Jewish experience and community.

Jews are a distinct and diverse American ethnic group
deserving fair and respectful inclusion in any Ethnic Studies curriculum. The ESMC as it is currently drafted, however, fails to impart these basic lessons. . This broad range of critical Jewish voices should demonstrate to you and your fellow IQC members that major revisions to the ESMC's treatment of the Jewish community are necessary. California's high school students will benefit from a pedagogically sound course in Ethnic Studies. As AB 2016 states, "t Sincerely, Julie J. Schimmel
