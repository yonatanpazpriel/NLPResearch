General Comments (Public Input Template follows) In an economically, racially, and ethnically diverse California, we properly profess respect for the individual and equality before the law. We are ethnically and intellectually diverse and look to this reality as a positive potential. We must understand history, learn, and in the ideal move towards a better future that provides economic growth, a peaceful, respectful society that provides opportunity, and a commitment to a better human condition for our children and grandchildren. In the education of our children we need to develop their skills of critical analysis, of the history of free self-governing peoples that we hope to remain among, and an understanding of the shortcomings of every society with an appreciation of the many failures in the human condition and in the history of human endeavor.
Unfortunately, these Model Curricula do not serve these goals, nor even the Introduction's professed goals. Quite the opposite, throughout the goals and the content of the curricula there is no respect for the individual in any meaningful sense. It is explicitly a class-based document positing a world view of "Oppressors vs. Oppressed" based on racial and sexual lines, and in fact makes no pretense otherwise. Among other disservices to the children and people of California, the program replaces individuality with class membership and respect for the law with a self-righteous indifference to the law. In fact, it posits law as a malevolent tool of oppression. Thus, rather than supporting diversity and tolerance, the Curriculum supports a small, pessimistic, and nihilistic slice of reality and inflates it into a parochial and insular worldview.
The sub-text of this narrative is that humans are powerless victims based on skin color, biological gender, gender orientation, etc. and that a "system" exists that must be overthrown by their class. However, this is belied by the vibrant successes of many Black and Hispanic Americans, Vietnamese, Sikh, other Indian, Chinese and Japanese, Cuban, and every other class of immigrant to flee poverty and oppression and arrive on our California

shores. Worldwide, billions have been lifted out of the direst poverty by emerging free markets and capitalism. This diverse reality receives no attention in the Model Curriculum.
The Model Curriculum purport to "empower" students, yet to empower students to any particular divisive and dissonant viewpoint is inappropriate at an age where they are formative. In a rational and diverse society, consideration of multiple viewpoints and a weighing of beneficial and detrimental values and histories is appropriate from an early age. From neurosciences we know a biological basis exists for neuronal development and cognitive formation in developing brains; this supports a non-doctrinaire, multiple-viewpoint approach. We know that unless children are taught early in development to attempt to weigh and view multiple viewpoints, critically and with objective rational principles, they may never reach their full potential with an ability to weigh varying qualities and viewpoints. We have a DUTY to our children to gift them an optimistic, hopeful, and rational worldview, and ability for critical analysis, not class-based despair and nihilism.
Finally, the field of Ethnic Studies is recognized within academia and by interested observers of all backgrounds as biased, insular, parochial, lacking in intellectual rigor, and based on foundations created by angry white men from Eastern Europe. In a developmental period where children and adolescents are learning foundational skills, Ethnic Studies is not appropriately taught at all.

"Hxstry", culturally and linguistically not in general use, a neologism inappropriate except in a graduate level class. One of many such neologisms. RECOMMEND: delete all neologisms, except in context of objective discussion of neologisms and in 12th grade. Curricula present a very narrow viewpoint in a doctrinaire and ideological fashion, an antithesis of critical thinking. RECOMMEND: a tolerant and diverse curriculum expressing the importance of attempting to understand multiple viewpoints and gathering rational information, weighing values, and studying historical successes and failures. "Empowering" students to any particular divisive and dissonant action is inappropriate at an age where they are formative and represents manipulation for the perceived benefits of the adult teachers. In a rational and diverse society, consideration of multiple viewpoints and a weighing of beneficial and detrimental values and histories, is appropriate from an early age. From neurosciences we know a biological basis exists for neuronal development and cognitive formation in adolescent and older brains supports a non-doctrinaire, multiple-viewpoint approach. RECOMMEND: non-doctrinaire, multiple viewpoint and culturally appropriate approach

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Rather than "a deep appreciation", the curricula posit a class warfare division and takes a very narrow world view. In the context of the last hundred years of history, it is egregious that the flight of Eastern European, Asian (and especially Hmong, Vietnamese, Sikh, and Indian), peoples to California from authoritarian states, for political and economic security, receives scant attention. Expression of a parochial and insular worldview. Ignores the experiences, values, and worldviews of millions of "people of color" in California.. As a basis for an educational curricula below graduate level, posits a divisive, violent, unidimensional worldview of class warfare, really the world view of angry white males from Eastern Europe foisted upon na�ve people of all colors and backgrounds. RECOMMEND: focus on improving human relations on an individual level, as well as the need for a strong, functional economy to alleviate poverty and provide security, opportunity, education, and self-actualization.
