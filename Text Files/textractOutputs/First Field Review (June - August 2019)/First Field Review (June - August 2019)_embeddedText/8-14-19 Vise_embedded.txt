Hello,
Please do not add the framework of "Capitalism is racist" to your curriculum. Capitalism has nothing to do with race. Capitalism concerns individual liberty and allows all persons to pursue their goal regardless of race. Please just teach the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic.
Thank you,
