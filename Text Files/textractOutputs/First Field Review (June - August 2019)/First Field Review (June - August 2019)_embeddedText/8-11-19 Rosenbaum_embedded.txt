Hi there,
I noticed there is a proposal to teach about Israel in school, specifically about BDS.
That organization falsely demonizes Israel which is a liberal democracy and the only one in the region.
Hundreds of American companies have offices in Israel including tech giants Google and Apple.
The curriculum should not include politically charged comments around BDS and should teach children about the power of democracy and freedom that Israel brings to the world.
