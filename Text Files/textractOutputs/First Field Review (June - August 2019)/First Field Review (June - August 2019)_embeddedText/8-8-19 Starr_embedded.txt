This site is not user friendly so I am not certain if this is the correct place for commentary, however after reading the objectives of the curriculum and as a former public school teacher , I am dismayed that this proposed curriculum is seriously considered. How does this program enhance understanding when it editorializes rather than provide factual data? It offers a distortion of "values and principles" offering a one sided approach. For learning, students need to explore and deduct in order to learn and understand. When they are fed doctrine this does not encourage objective thinking. It is important to reconsider this example of ethnic study and return to basics.
