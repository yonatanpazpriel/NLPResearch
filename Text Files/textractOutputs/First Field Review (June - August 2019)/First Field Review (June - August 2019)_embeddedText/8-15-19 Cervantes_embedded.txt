From: Griselda Cervantes Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies
To the board of education: I am opposing the ethnic studies module. I believe that parents and family members can teach their children about their ethic background if they pleased. There is no need for our teachers to do so. Our tax money should not be going into this program.
