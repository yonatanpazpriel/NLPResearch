Hello, this is a major complaint on the ethnic studies outline submitted for California adoption. This course at no time correctly reflects the Jewish experience or the current rise in anti-Semitism currently taking place here in California, around the US and around the world. Start over and include all marginalized groups . Monica Stanley Teacher
