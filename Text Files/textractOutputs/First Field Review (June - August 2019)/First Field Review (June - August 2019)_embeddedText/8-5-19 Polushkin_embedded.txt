I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. As a Jew who came to the United States as a political refugee from the Soviet Union and as a parent to two American-born Jewish teenagers, I strongly believe that the proposed curriculum would seed more hate and renewed persecution of the Jews. I urge the state to instead add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
