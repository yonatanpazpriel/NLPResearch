From: Jo Anne Simon Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed curriculum
A mandatory ethnic studies curriculum is difficult and complicated fraught with personal emotions perhaps appropriate for some, but not for everyone. You will never make everyone happy, but you walk a fine line of exclusion, in this case almost blatant antisemitism - the opposite of what you're trying to redress. A bad idea all around.
