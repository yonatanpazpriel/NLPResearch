Hello
On behalf of the Jewish Community Center-Federation of San Luis Obispo, I am submitting the public comment form regarding the first draft of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
We are encouraged to know that a new proposal is being drafted, and support the learning of diverse perspectives and peoples in our CA educational system. That being said, we want to highlight the specific issues - the omission of the American Jewish experience, and the vilification and delegitimization of the state of Israel, in the first proposed curriculum.
Thank you for your good work and consideration.

The proposed curriculum omits a definition of anti-Semitism, and on page 2 includes a definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions), a movement that seeks to vilify and delegitimize the existence of the state of Israel.
Problematic topics include on page 234: 4956. Line Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter 4957. Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel 4958. Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico

On page 242, the ESMC uses politically biased language to refer to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61) and on pages 268-69 (lines 5802-03) it uses the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
