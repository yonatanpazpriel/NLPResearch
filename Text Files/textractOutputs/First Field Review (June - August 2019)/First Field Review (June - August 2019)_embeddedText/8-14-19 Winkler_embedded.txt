As a second generation Holocaust Survivor, a citizen of the US, and long time California resident, I am appalled that you would include anti-semetic and anti-Israel language and content in your proposed curriculum. I am a professor emeritus of 33 years at Sacramento State University at Sacramento, and a former curriculum advisor and coordinator of the Single Subject in Art. I can clearly recognize prejudice and bias in a statewide curriculum.
I hope that you will revise your curriculum to fairly portray the Jewish people and the Holocaust, a loss of six million lives in the Holocaust (including most of my family), in your state curriculum. With a significant rise in anti-Semitism in our communities, on college campuses, the possibility that this biased, anti-Semitic and anti-Israel curriculum could be part of every public high school in California is unacceptable.
"It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were to instead marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
