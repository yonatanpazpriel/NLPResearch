From: Kim Deweese Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 6:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
My name is Kim Deweese, a retired teacher with 37 years of teaching experience in the state of California. I represent no organization but continue to hope that California will offer a balanced curriculum to its students. I am disappointed in the scope of this proposed curriculum for the following reasons:
Chapter 3/page1- no mention of the Jews as an ethnic group. Glossary - no mention of the Jews as an ethnic group. Appendices - no mention of the Jews as an ethnic group ( except for a brief mention in the section titled European Immigration).
Thank you for the opportunity to address this proposed curriculum. I hope it will be re-evaluated in a more balanced manner.
Very sincerely, Kim Deweese
