Hi I am just an ordinary person(not black, Mexican or white)just an Italian! 1. I have seen over the years the educators and politicians movement to eliminate the History of America from school kids. Please we have a responsibility to the kids to teach them. Why are you looking at Latinos and black groups to change are History. Your object will have a damaging affect on the children. What other country sets out to destroy its culture and history? Please this program's agenda is bad for the student.This program is full of diversity and racist.Just look at some of the suggestions:Oscar Rivera carried out more than 130 bomb attacks,Ms.Lebron was convicted of attempted murder!
Chief Seattle a fictional environmentalist these are all BAD and very poor examples for school kids.Teachers are not teaching American History and Culture but racism and diversity!I I have a major concern how the Committee was chosen. I count 6 Latinos and a Latino teacher?.You are not fulfilling your responsibilities to our children you are going in the wrong direction with racism an diversity.thanks Dr.Frank B. USC 65
