It is Commendable that the State of California has proposed establishing an Ethnic Studies Curriculum/Guideline for Elementary and High School Students.The intent of this program, I assume, is to promote Tolerance and Understanding in a State as Diverse and Multicultural as ours is. The promotion of Reasoning, Evidence based discussion, and Critical Thinking on such Topics is certainly long overdue.
Unfortunately, in reviewing the Curriculum, I found that in the context of Arab-Israeli relations implicitly Antisemitic statements were made without comment on the topics of either Anti-Semitism or the Jewish Experience. This, I feel, does not represent a neutral stance on a complex subject.
Certainly the goal of promoting multicultural understanding is not facilitated by this bias and omission and I would strongly urge that a thorough review and vetting of this curriculum be concluded from all parts of our community, lest we establish a program which, itself, will only contribute to the misunderstanding and misrepresentation already present in our diverse society. An objective, apolitical guideline for such a curriculum would be a preferred starting point. Let's get this right!
