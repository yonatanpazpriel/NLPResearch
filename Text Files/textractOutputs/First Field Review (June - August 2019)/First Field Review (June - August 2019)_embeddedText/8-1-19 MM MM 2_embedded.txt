If you mandate ethnic studies in schools, every Republican or conservative minded family will:
A. Move out of state. B. Homeschool. C. Pay for private school.
Dont worry, there are plenty of English learners, fetal alcohol syndrome kids, MS13 members and others that will be left to fill the seats!
