From: Mary N. Marino Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments
I vehemently oppose much of the language and topics in the proposed ethnic studies curriculum model. The funding of our public schools is primarily dependent on property tax that is generated by businesses, commerce centers, and homeowners in a capitalistic system. The comments vilifying capitalism are inflammatory and unwarranted! In addition, as a retired Life-Credentialed teacher (31 years), I could barely comprehend what seemed to be newly-created provocative terms intended to indoctrinate high school students. It's disheartening to see such a political agenda inserted into social studies.
The State Board of Education should exercise due diligence and postpone any approval of such a model. To quote the teachers' standard comment for displeasure, "No redeemable qualities."
