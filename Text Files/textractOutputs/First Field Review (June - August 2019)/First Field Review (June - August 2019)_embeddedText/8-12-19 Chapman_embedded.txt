As an educated Jewish citizen and taxpayer of California I strongly object to the outline of the proposed curriculum. This curriculum ignores anti semitism and delegitimizes the State of Israel with its implicit sanctioning of the BDS campaign. This Arab and anti Semitic BDS propaganda movement has as its primary goal the destruction of the world's only Jewish state. This type of institutional bias has no place in our taxpayer funded public school curriculum. David J Chapman MD
