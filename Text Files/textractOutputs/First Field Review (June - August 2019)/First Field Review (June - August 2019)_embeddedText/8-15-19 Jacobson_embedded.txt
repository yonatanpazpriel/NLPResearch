With California school children performing well below students in other states on standardized tests, I believe basic skills of reading, math, and critical thinking skills should be the main focus in school. This curriculum is filled with far-left propaganda. Capitalism is vilified and labeled a form of power and oppression. This kind of rhetoric is not a thoughtful economic analysis of different economic and political structures. This entire curriculum focuses on the negative � the oppression of minorities � and creates more division and antagonism while demonizing white people and our country. It is blatantly anti-Semitic.

Glossary and Bibliography
Sample Course Models

Pg 1: no mention of anti-Semitism, even though most hate crimes in this country are against Jews. pg 2: promotes BDS Terrorists of all sorts � Palestinians, a Puerto Rican bomber and Lolita Lebron whose attack on Congress left 5 Congressmen shot � are uncritically praised. Students are encouraged to take action in the same way.
