While we support broadening the knowledge of our students about various ethnic groups, we have grave concerns about the proposed information as presented regarding the Arab American section.
Specifically, it is clearly NOT a neutral presentation of facts, which we presume is the goal. Rather, it appears to clearly take positions that are "talking points" put out by the Palestinian movement.
We strongly urge you to reconsider.
Sincerely,
Colleen and Allan Lukoff
