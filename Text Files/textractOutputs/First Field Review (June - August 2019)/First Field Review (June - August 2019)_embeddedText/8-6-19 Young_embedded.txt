From: Shari Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 9:20 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Support Arab Studies
I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of ethnic studies in California. I support the objectives listed on page 233, as well as a history of migration to the US on page 236. We especially need this in current times. Thank you, The Rev. Shari Young St. James Episcopal Church San Francisco
