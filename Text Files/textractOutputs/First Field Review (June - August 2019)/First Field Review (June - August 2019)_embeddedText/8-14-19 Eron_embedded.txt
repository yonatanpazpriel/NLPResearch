intro-overviewesmc.docx � Thank you for your hard work, but as a parent with a 3rd and 7th grader, I am VERY CONCERNED about the CA "Ethnic Studies" initiative. Shall we instead call it "Brainwashing Your Children into Supporting our Agenda for People of Color in the United States." As you know, children are extremely susceptible to what they hear, good and bad.

In reading the documents, I feel the entire initiative is POLITICALLY MOTIVATED and has an

agenda promoted by a niche minority for their own purposes. Reading the outline, this is not

about celebrating many cultures and the benefits of diversity � but rather a critique of "settler

colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy".

3.

center and place high value on pre-colonial, ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, familial,

and marginalized knowledge;

4.

critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy,

cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and

oppression at the intersections of our society

THIS IS POLITICALLY MOTIVATED.

Community- Ethnic Studies teaching and learning is meant to serve as a bridge between

educational spaces/institutions and community. Thus, encouraging students to use their

knowledge to become agents of change, social justice organizers and advocates, and engaged

global citizens.

YOU ARE ENLISTING OUR CHILDREN TO BE AGENTS OF YOUR CHANGE.

Inquiry��An inquiry-based approach to Ethnic Studies invites students to become active participants in the learning process. Students are encouraged to pose questions, investigate and explore academic content, and research and theorize solutions to problems created by centuries of settler colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy.
YOU ARE USING YOUR FRINGE MINORITY CURRENT DAY POLITICAL IDEOLOGY TO PLACE JUDGEMENT ON PAST HISTORY.
For example, if students decide they want to advocate for voting rights for undocumented immigrant residents at the school district or city elections, they can develop arguments in favor of such a city ordinance and then plan a meeting with their city council person or school board member.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT HAVING OUR CHILDREN BE BETTER NATIONAL/GLOBAL CITIZENS. IT IS USING OUR CHILDREN AS SOLDIERS IN YOUR POLITICAL CRUSADE.
