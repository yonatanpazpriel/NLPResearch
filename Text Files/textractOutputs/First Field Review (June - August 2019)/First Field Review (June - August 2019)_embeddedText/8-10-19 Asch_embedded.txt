From: Steven Asch Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 9:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Please change the antisemitic curriculum!
Dear Commisioners:
As a professor myself, I could not be more supportive of teaching ethnic studies in public schools. But for education to train future citizens, it must be balanced and teach the Enlightenment values of tolerance and sensitivity. The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) does not achieve that goal, and may indeed promote the division and intolerance that it purports to oppose. Several particular concerns arise:
 Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned  ï¿½ Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even
though half of religious-based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective  A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included
As a Jew and an educator, I find this particularly disturbing. Violent acts of religious intolerance in this country have become ever more common, and Jews are often the target. Certainly Jews rank among the most historically persecuted ethnic groups in history, and ignoring that on breeds more violence.
So please think again about how we can teach our children what we so sorely need: tolerance and balance - and change the ESMC..
Thank you.
Steven Asch
