From: Dennis Kelly Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 6:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Members of the Committee,
As a teacher with 35 years of classroom experience and another 13 years of related schools service, as an Irish-surnamed man raised Roman Catholic with 16 years of parochial training, and as a convert to Judaism and member of the Jewish Labor Federation who has occasionally been targeted for my religious affiliation, I do not expect the multi-ethnic state curriculum to precisely reflect my experience.
I do, however, expect it to be fair.
I do not mind using the Arabic term for the creation of Israel as long as it is in a context that acknowledges the independence movement and the attempt to grow a democracy in the sands of autocratic governments. It might even be healthy to point out that territorial decisions are seldom peaceful and that even the wonderful work on the illegitimate border of Northern Ireland needs constant tending.
Our students are done no favors when the world is mashed to pablum and fed to them. Our students are bright and deserve to see the complexities of life so they can better prepare for the hard decisions they will have to make.
I urge you to carefully consider a healthy and balanced window into the American Jewish experience (and the Armenian, the Assyrian, the Basque, and, well, you can probably fill out the alphabet as well as I can).
Best wishes for the best work in the serious issue before you.
Dennis Kelly San Francisco
