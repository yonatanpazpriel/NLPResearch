This effort cannot fail. We are literally coming apart at the seams of our democracy. I feel like my generation (56 years of age) of Americans and those behind me have such incorrect and incomplete information about one another. We have to learn more about how connected we are to one another, and how the contributions of each groups are part of a beautiful fabric.
Pg 2. This incredibly powerful and to the point: Ethnic Studies has created a space for all
students to learn about and analyze their identities and hxrstories, feel proud of them, and actualize their full humanity. I would add the world-altering opportunity to see oneself in others and to build connection.

Perhaps the most important aspect of this statewide endeavor is professional development of educators. As stated in the report, a substantial investment has to be made to prepare teachers to deliver content, but also to manage the range of emotions predicted within groups, as predicted by Racial Identity Development Theory. The worst thing that could happen is that a teach get assigned this who resents the assignment and/or the conetn or groups represented. How will you do this quality control in the most privileged school districts, the most rural districts, the districts with the least diverse educator staff? Educators teaching this will need ongoing support and a professional community. Ideally this would be done regionally or within a district. This is emotionally demanding to teach and educators need to be supported. If this is done well (beyond initiating the curriculum to ongoing monitoring and improvement, I know of no other intervention that has the demonstrated impact on young people of all races. Districts should hire appropriate coaching consultants, i.e. the "Precious Knowledge" folks.
