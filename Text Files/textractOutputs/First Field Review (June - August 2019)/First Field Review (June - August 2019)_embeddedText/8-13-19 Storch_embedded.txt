From: artie Storch Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:03 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies curriculum
To whom it may concern; I am a parent and an educator in the SF Bay Area. I wish to express, in the strongest possible terms, my disappointment and disapproval of aspects of the new ethnic studies curriculum. While such a program is laudable, the short shrift given to Anti Semitism, and the portrayal of BDS as "a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." makes a mockery of the intentions of this course, which I have to believe were good in the beginning. I can not imagine, for example, omitting Islamophobia from the course, and then portraying Donald Trump's proposed travel ban from Muslim countries as "an American social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Americans living under threats of terrorism." While condemnation of Israel and the all too frequent use of that as a gateway to outright Anti Semitism has become somewhat normalized, we must try that much harder to maintain an unbiased approach if we are to instill in our children the critical thinking skills needed to become intelligent global citizens.
Sincerely,
Artie Storch
