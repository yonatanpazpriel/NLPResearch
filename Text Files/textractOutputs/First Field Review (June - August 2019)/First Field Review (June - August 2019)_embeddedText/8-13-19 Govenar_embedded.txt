As a lifelong Californian, and Jewish, it is appalling to hear that an ethnic studies program created in 2019 would minimize Jewish history and contributions to our society and ignoring the growing rise of anti-Semitism in America and around the world.
Just two days ago I was in a group of well-educated people in their 40's, from Napa- Sonoma area. One of their friends spoke of Miami and said "I can't stand those New Yorkers that flock down here, you know, with their accents and their habits." Part of that could be the eastern accent, but part of it was "those" people.
Anti-Semitism and stereotypes of Jews persist and is in fact growing and if not addressed and taught, will continue to escalate.
P.S. Never forget or we are doomed to repeat.
