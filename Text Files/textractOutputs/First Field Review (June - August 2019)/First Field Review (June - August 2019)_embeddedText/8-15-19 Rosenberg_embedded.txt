From: Emily Rosenberg Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 12:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft needs revision-Ethinic Studies
Thank you for announcing Wednesday that the draft will be revised . The choices you make will affect the next generation of Californians and must show them both the distinctions and commonalities of many ethnic groups to ensure they have ethnic pride and celebrate ALL people's ethnic pride--white, brown, semitic, etc etc. .
We hope that you will do a much better job of including Armenian communities who built the Central Valley, Jewish people who developed major business in San Francisco including Levis, Hindu people who are key in Silicon Valley and Koreans who are a distinct people with their own ethnic heritage not to be seen as Japanese or Chinese. Most of these people were banned from private universities until fifty years ago., most suffer discrimination today--the mass shooting this spring in the Poway synagogue, taunts about appearance and failure to recognize the wide ranges of religious holidays part of traditional cultures.
People from these cultures need a place on the decision making bodies and curriculum development committees starting now. Thank you.
