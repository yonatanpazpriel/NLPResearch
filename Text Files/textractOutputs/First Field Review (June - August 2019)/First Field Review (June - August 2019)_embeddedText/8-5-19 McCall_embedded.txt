From: Richard McCall Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 11:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum Guidelines
I have read the above-referenced material on your webpage. It is NOT about widening student's perspective. It is NOT designed to encourage discussion by presenting opposing views. It does not qualify as education. It is, clearly, indoctrination to a certain far-left political ideology. It is SHAMEFUL.
And it is anti-capitalism which does not have anything to do with a person's ethnicity. Are they going to teach that we can thank capitalism for lifting millions of people out of poverty like nothing else ever has in the history of mankind? I didn't see that in your guidelines.
You are pushing more kids into charter schools. If they have to "teach" this garbage at charter schools also, more kids are going to leave public high schools altogether. I know mine will.
