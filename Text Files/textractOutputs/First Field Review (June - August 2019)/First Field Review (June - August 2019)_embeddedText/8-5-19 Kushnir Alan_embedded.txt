The definition Boycott Divestment and Sanctions movement is false and misleading. The very first sentence includes "...that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" The stated aim of the BDS movement is to eliminate the Jewish state of Israel. In his own words, the founder of BDS said "Definitely, most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine." Secondly, there is no apartheid in Israel for Palestinians. All citizens can vote, and Palestinian Arabs are in the Knesset and on the Israeli supreme court. So, this entire `definition' mischaracterizes what is an anti-Semitic movement. The US house of representatives recently overwhelmingly passed HR 246 (398-17) included the following:
"Whereas the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement (BDS Movement) targeting Israel is a campaign that does not favor a two-state solution and that seeks to exclude the State of Israel and the Israeli people from the economic, cultural, and academic life of the rest of the world;
Whereas the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement is one of several recent political movements that undermines the possibility for a negotiated solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by demanding concessions of one party alone and encouraging the Palestinians to reject negotiations in favor of international pressure;
Whereas the founder of the Global BDS Movement, Omar Barghouti, has denied the right of the Jewish people in their homeland, saying, "We oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian, rational Palestinian, not a sell-out Palestinian, will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine.";
Whereas the Global BDS Movement targets not only the Israeli government but also Israeli academic, cultural, and civil society institutions, as well as individual Israeli citizens of all political persuasions, religions, and ethnicities, and in some cases even Jews of other nationalities who support Israel;

Whereas the Global BDS Movement does not recognize, and many of its supporters explicitly deny, the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination;
Whereas university-based Global BDS efforts violate the core goals of the university and global cultural development, which thrive on free and open exchange and debate, and in some cases, leads to the intimidation and harassment of Jewish students and others who support Israel;
Whereas the Global BDS Movement promotes principles of collective guilt, mass punishment, and group isolation, which are destructive of prospects for progress towards peace and a two-state solution;
Whereas boycotts and similar tools aimed at promoting racial justice and social change have been used effectively in the United States, South Africa, and other parts of the world; Whereas in contrast to protest movements that have sought racial justice and social change, the Global Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions Movement targeting Israel is not about promoting coexistence, civil rights, and political reconciliation but about questioning and undermining the very legitimacy of the country and its people:
The definition of BDS in the draft ethnic studies curriculum is false and misleading and should be corrected to include the statements above which accurately characterize it.
GENERAL COMMENT: The Ethnic Course models have no reference to the Jewish Ethnic group. This group has suffered displacement, genocide, ghettos, and discrimination, for thousands of years. The antiSemitism continues today under in the form of anti-Zionism. Why has the Jewish group been ignored???
Page 258 and forward
Only Arab stereotypes are listed. Why is there no section to teach children of the long history of anti-Semitism.???. Anti-Semitism has existed in the US and still permeates the teaching of school children in Arab Countries. We need to include meaningful and accurate teaching on the discrimination that Jews have suffered so students get a balanced knowledge of what different groups have experienced.

Page 2 line 42 � Definition of Capitalism
The definition of Capitalism provided with reference to Ethnic Studies is not one that is generally accepted. It posits a negative aspect of capitalism and the definition should be value neutral. For example:
Capitalism is an economic system. In it the government plays a secondary role. People and companies make most of the decisions and own most of the property. ... The means of production are largely or entirely privately owned (by individuals or companies) and operated for profit.
There should be a corresponding accurate definition of Socialism:
Page 15 line 366 Definition of "Whiteness"
Including such a concept is offensive and racist in its intent and purpose. It is racist to teach students that being white confers privilege. Any time a sweeping generalization is applied to all members of a race we are seeing racism in its plainest form. Please remove this and other racist concepts from this curriculum.
