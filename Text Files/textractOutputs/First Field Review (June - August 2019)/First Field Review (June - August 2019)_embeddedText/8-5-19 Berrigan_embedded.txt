California is a leader in the development and implementation of relevant and progressive curriculum for schools. I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings.

Migration is a key part of US history and world history; it is a human need and a human right. Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.

Arabs and Arab Americans are an embattled community at this point in US history and experience significant hardship from racist and religiously motivated hatred. I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
