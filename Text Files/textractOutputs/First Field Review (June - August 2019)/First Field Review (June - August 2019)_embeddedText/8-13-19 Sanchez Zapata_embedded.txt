We strongly opposed to this proposed curriculum for public schools. It is anticapitalist, anti Semitic and anti american. This proposed curriculum is indoctrination of our children and has no place in our schools Schools should only teach academics and not politics Children should be taught to think for themselves We don't want my tax money being misspent on this terrible proposed curriculum ! Capitalism has done more to pull out people out of poverty than any other kind of government I demand you kill this proposed curriculum! Thank you Migdalia Sanchez, Cesar Sanchez, Perfida Zapata
