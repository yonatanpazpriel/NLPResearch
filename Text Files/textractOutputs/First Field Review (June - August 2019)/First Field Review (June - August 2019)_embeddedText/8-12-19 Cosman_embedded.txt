page 2, lines 30-40 It seems like you should use the Glossary for defining the vocabulary of Ethnic Studies. If BDS belongs under B, then so does Black Power. But these are movements, not the basic vocabulary of Ethnic Studies. You should probably discuss movements in the Curriculum, not the Glossary. page 10, line 249 The Glossary is not the place to talk about BDS, but also I don't think it's a good example of a liberation movement. There's a difference between legitimate US liberation movements (Black, Latinx, LGBTQ, etc.) seeking equality under the law, and international hate movements (BDS) advocating the destruction of a nation. page 234, lines 4956-4958 I learned in History class that controversies can have good points on both sides, and I am waiting to hear the Israeli side of the Israel-Palestine controversy. BDS and Direct Action Front for Palestine look like anti-semitic hate groups to me, because they advocate the destruction of the one Jewish nation in the world. Education should be balanced, and this looks too much like indoctrination.

page 237, line 5030 Please don't list Israel-Palestine as an Arab country. It doesn't fit the definitions of an Arab country that you mention in the same paragraph. I read George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four and learned how totalitarians change definitions to control people's thoughts. This isn't happening for me, but it could happen for students who aren't well informed and don't know about Israel. There are 22 Arab countries: pick one and put its name in here. page 242, lines 5157-5163 I'm worried about that business of lopsided definitions again. I know the Palestinians use the word "Nakba" (catastrophe) for the founding of Israel. The other name for it, used by the other indigenous group in that region, is "Reishit Tz'michat Ge'ulatenu" (beginning of our redemption). You could give both terms, to show that "one man's meat is another man's poison." When you give just one of these terms, it looks like you think the other one is illegitimate. pages 256 and 264-269 In this chapter you show two examples of a minority person dissing other minority people. In the first example ("Arab Money"), it gets called out and corrected, and that's what the lesson is about. In the second example ("Somos Sur"), it just sits there without being called out or corrected. Talking about Israelis, who are an ancient indigenous group in Israel (it used to be the Kingdom of Israel, then the Romans called it Judea, etc.), that poem calls us colonizers. Don't miss the chance to do an Ethnic Studies critique of this statement. page 239, line 6238 I couldn't help looking for anti-semitism in this document, since I got all those emails about how it was way biased in favor of BDS. This is the place I found it, and that looks like a problem to me as well. This document needs a whole chapter on the Jews, not just one token mention of anti-semitism in passing.
