Jews are deeply concerned by sections of the Calif curriculum which omit antisemitism as a form of bigotry and openly promote hateful boycotts against the Jewish State of Israel. Despite its stated purpose, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and as the American community most targeted by hate crimes based on religion.
