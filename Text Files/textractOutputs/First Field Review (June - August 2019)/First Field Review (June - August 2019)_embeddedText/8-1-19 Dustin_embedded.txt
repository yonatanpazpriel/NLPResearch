I am strongly opposed to this curriculum which is thinly veiled propaganda that paints a narrative unsubstantiated by actual evidence.
The ability to create one's own business has helped millions out of poverty, and my reading of your curriculum concludes that it suggests the exact opposite of that. Such tropes are harmful to perpetuate amongst our youth in the public school system.
