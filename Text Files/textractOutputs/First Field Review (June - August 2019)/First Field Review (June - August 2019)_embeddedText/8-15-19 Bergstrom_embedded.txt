LAS VIRGENES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT RESOLUTION NO 5-19 OPPOSITION OF THE ETHNIC STUDIES MODEL CURRICULUM

WHEREAS: On September 13, 2016 the Governor of the State of California signed AB 2016 into law adding Section 51226.7 to the California Education Code to require the Instructional Quality Commission to develop, and the state board to adopt, modify, or revise, a model curriculum in ethnic studies designed to "encourage each school district and charter school that maintains any of grades 9 to 12 that does not otherwise offer a standards-based ethnic studies curriculum to offer a course of study in ethnic studies based on the model curriculum;" and WHEREAS: Properly developed ethnic studies programs have been shown to benefit pupils in observable ways, expanding their understanding of the diverse world they live in, deepening their academic engagement and performance and ultimately improving their graduation rates while developing a sense of selfefficacy and personal empowerment; and

WHEREAS: The LVUSD Governing Board believes that the development of educational standards should be founded in research and developed with broad input that represent the rich diversity of backgrounds and beliefs that reflect our state and be guided by the core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations; and

WHEREAS: State adopted curriculum must provide all pupils with excellent educational opportunities, without regard to race, gender, ethnicity, nationality, income, sexual orientation, or disability to prepare students to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures; and
WHEREAS: The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum [ESMC] presents a biased and unacceptable point of view that does not comply with its primary principle to "Include accurate information based on current and confirmed research to...promote critical thinking and rigorous analysis of history, systems of oppression, and the status quo in an effort to generate discussions on futurity, and imagine new possibilities;" and

WHEREAS: Throughout the materials and glossary, the ESMC is inaccurate and misleading, providing statements based on ideological opinion and not research or facts. In addition, the draft reflects extreme points of views, excludes important demographics, and contains dangerous antisemetic indoctrination and clear political bias; and

WHEREAS: The global history of discrimination, diaspora, and hateful violence, as well as lessons on awareness and acceptance, are crucial to the intentions of the ESMC, the decision by the Commission to exclude antisemitism or the Armenian genocide marginalizes the American Jewish and American Armenian experiences, amongst others; and

WHEREAS: The ESMC draft advances an extreme and politically motivated biased point of view that delegitimizes the existence of the State of Israel while also delivering sole condemnation against Israel, while delivering outright support of the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement; and

WHEREAS: The inclusion of BDS is antithetical to the underlying values of ethnic studies as it promotes discrimination on the basis of national origin and religion and is in violation of California law and policy. [Assembly Bill 2844,201516 leg.]; and

WHEREAS: The drafters of the ESMC provide an extreme, politically motivated definition of "Capitalism" that align this foundational element of our economic system as being comparable to the horrific ills of "racism" and "white supremacy," further contradicting the values of ESMC content to: "empower students to be engaged socially and politically, enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism;" and

NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED: The LVUSD Governing Board recognizes that both the process that led to the development of the ESMC and the draft outcome submitted for review were deeply polluted from the very beginning with systemic and dangerous antisemtic bias and an unyielding and unhealthy desire to advance and indoctrinate extreme political ideology into our public schools.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: The LVUSD Governing Board resoundly rejects the proposed ESMC and requests that a revised curriculum be drafted by a new panel free of political bias, narrow ideology, and discriminatory beliefs.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED: The LVUSD Governing Board asks the State Board of Education to review the process that enabled the development of the deeply flawed proposed curriculum and review the membership of the Instructional Quality Commission to ensure diverse backgrounds and points of view are adequately represented.
