From: Linda Bresnick Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 1:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Bias Issues with California 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern,
Please review and revise the ways in which Jews, Judaism, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and antiSemitism are represented in [or omitted from] this Model Curriculum. It is especially important now, in our country's current climate of rising hatred, that students are taught understanding and tolerance towards all ethnic groups without marginalizing any.
As stated by the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were to instead marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
