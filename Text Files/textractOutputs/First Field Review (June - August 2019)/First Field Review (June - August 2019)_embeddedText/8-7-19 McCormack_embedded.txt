Considering the Irish and Chinese (over 23,000) immigrants came to California in the 1800s and were condemned as "foreign workers," they contributed to the beginnings of the state and country. Most built the railroads. The Irish and Welsh immigrants also worked in the underground mines. On the east coast, the Irish were condemned by the blacks and called pigs, many blacks began a wave of discrimination by putting signs in stores windows basically telling the Irish not to shop there. The Germans from Russia came in the late 1800s to settle land the railroads were selling at a "low cost." Little did the new immigrants know this land was not suitable to grow crops. Germans that immigrated to the middle of the U.S. to farm in the mid-1800s faced discrimination in both of the world wars. Some German families were required to house U.S. soldiers, even though it was against the Constitution. Italians also began immigrating in the 1800s. They worked in the fields harvesting crops, lumber mills in northern California, and factories. Along with the Chinese, the Italians clustered in groups within the cities, Little Italy. By the early 1900s on the east coast, the eugentics movement went door to door in the Italian housing projects to sell birth control because they didn't want any more of "those" people here. Many of the first Scottish in America (1600s), came as the first type of slavery we had in the colonies. They were captives of war and sold to the colonies. In the last 20 years in Northern California, we have also seen immigrants from the Ukraine, Serbia, Croatia, and other former Soviet block countries.

California teachers are required to take multi-cultural education classes for certification. Teachers learn that multiple cultures have stories and to show respect for the culture. Playing a blame game negates character education. Personally, a blame game does not promote a safe classroom atmosphere. This curriculum framework does not promote conversation, but an unsafe atmosphere where division and cliques are prevalent.

If the curriculum is going to express ethnic diversity, the European immigrants need to be included. This would also show how immigrants overcame adversity, not by screaming or having tantrums like a child, but by finding a way to develop relationships, become citizens, and work to make a better life. Considering our country is having a crime problem, using biographies of criminals is not promoting character for students, it actually confuses how students should follow our laws. The American Dream so many immigrants come to the United States searching for is allowable by capitalism. It is not a form of oppression and power. Immigrants know this that is why they come here. Other forms of government economies do not give opportunities for the poor. The most successful immigrants realize that hard work, success in school, and learning English (for non-speakers) bring the most opportunities in the United States. The curriculum needs to show how immigrants can build each other up by competing for good grades, communicating in English, and promoting legal (non-crime) jobs. In terms of education, Asian and Pacific Islanders immigrants have high expectations for their children and as a result their children achieve academic success faster.

Abraham Lincoln stated that divided we fall. Our differences make each family unique, but our similarities give us the strength of community. Celebrating culture and our ethnicity should not be larger than our American culture. Immigrants coming to the United States should know what the U.S. ethnic identity is. By always promoting pointing out how others are different through social media, magazines, etc., we cause low self-esteem, emotional unbalanced behavior, and a lack of belonging or always searching for a place to belong. Creating words to define the curriculum is not how to explain racism. The glossary of "new" words needs to be eliminated, correct word spelling and usage needs to be used. Years ago the term negro was considered derogatory and black was the preferred term. It obviously did not work. Changing words does not teach ideology. In Germany, they have created museums about WWII to teach about the horrors. Yes, teaching history in the context and time it happened actually teaches. In Japan, they also have museums to teach about the war. In many countries, tourists can visit castles and see how life was long ago. History needs to be taught, to keep the bad from being repeated. Eliminating parts of history or changing words allows for repeats of the terrible events.
