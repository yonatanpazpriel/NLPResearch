I am opposed to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum:
This is because of its failure to explore anti-Semitism, its implicit endorsement of the movement to single out Israel to boycott from all the countries of the world while not exploring the founders' of that movement's anti-Jewish goals. This falls woefully short as an ethnic studies curriculum and should be voted down before it stokes more hatred and discrimination against Jewish students.
