From: eleanor lindenbaum Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 2:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: jill.lindenbaum Subject: Ethnic studies bias overt
Ethnic studies should be an evaluation of many cultures with equal non biases. No group should be the source and bias of any people in a public school or any education of young people. Whoever wrote this has a biased agenda from the beginning. Whoever sanctioned this should be dismissed and let go. Whoever knew of this ethnic studies should also be sanctioned. Why is California doing this? Who is the author of this document? Eleanor Lindenbaum Redondo Beach California
