As a member of the California Jewish community I am ashamed and embarrassed by the proposed ethnic curriculum being considered to become a part of mandatory education for students. There are no lessons about Jews as a sizable ethnic minority and frequent target of anti-Semitism. There is considerable coverage of the BDS movement and of the mideast conflict through the Palestinian narrative. Obviously, this perspective is to delegitimize Israel and to conceive of its destruction. And what does the Mid East conflict have to do with educating Californians about the contributions of ethnic groups to the success of California and the United States. It is extremely important to have a balanced, fact based curriculum to educate our children about the history of California. I sincerely hope your group will take these concerns into consideration in creating a balanced curriculum for ethnic studies.
