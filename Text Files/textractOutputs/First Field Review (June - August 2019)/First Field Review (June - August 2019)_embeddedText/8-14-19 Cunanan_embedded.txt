I am writing in support of the development of the ethnic studies model curriculum. The diversity of our students in the classroom as well as the xenophobic and racist political climate in which we educate our students requires that the state of California provide a well-rounded educational curriculum that is ethnic studies which is inclusive, tolerant, historically representative, and teaches empathy, compassion, and justice. I urge the CDE and the IQC to take the necessary steps to see forth that this curriculum best represents what the Advisory Committee assembled, that the curriculum best reflects the tenets of what birthed Ethnic Studies in the first place, and that they take into consideration not the number of oppositional public comments received but rather the depth to which Ethnic Studies can aid in the identity development of students and can develop their understanding and relationship social justice, impact, and societal change.
