Our schools should be a safe place for everyone!!!!!!!!!!!! I am a concerned parent!! California has been our home for almost 15 years, we are good citizens and committed individuals to our community. It shocks me that we are facing this type of antisemitism coming from the responsibles of our future generations education!! In a time when the country is facing division and violence against minorities this is unacceptable!!!! Our schools should be a safe place for everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
