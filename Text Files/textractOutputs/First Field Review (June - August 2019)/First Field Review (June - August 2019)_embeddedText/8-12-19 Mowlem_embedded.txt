From: Shay Mowlem Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 8:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Rewrite Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am extremely concerned and disappointed by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As an Israeli immigrant who has lived in the US as a citizen from a young age, I am deeply disturbed and fearful by the anti-semitic message in the current ESMC curriculum.
The one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish and Israeli citizens (like me) and students (like my children) may be stereotyped, accused of dual-loyalty, harassed and forced to face social litmus tests.
I ask that you make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Shay Mowlem
