This incendiary bill should not be passed under any circumstances. To require California high school students to take the Middle Eastern Ethnic Studies course, with its pro-BDS curriculum, puts every single Jewish student at risk of being verbally and physically attacked for generations to come, Heaven forbid. The course is specifically designed to discredit and demonize the State of Israel, the only homeland of the Jewish people, and a world leader in science, technology, medicine and cyber-security. Being a proud 1961 graduate of George Washington High School, San Francisco, the passage of AB-331 is unthinkable. I beseech the California Department of Education to please defeat this pernicious and mean-spirited bill. Thank you for your consideration. Respectfully, L. Cosden
