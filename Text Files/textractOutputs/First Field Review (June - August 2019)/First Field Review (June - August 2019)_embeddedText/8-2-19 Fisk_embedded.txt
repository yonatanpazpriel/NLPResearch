DID YOU KNOW THAT MORE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED IN THE USA BY PRIVATE EMPLOYERS THAN THE GOVERNMENT? WHOEVER THOUGHT UP THIS TERRIBLE CURRICULUM ITEM SHOULD BE SENT BACK TO SCHOOL. MOST LIKELY THE IDEA CAME FROM A GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE (STATE, FEDERAL OR LOCAL) WHO HAS NEVER HAD TO BUILD A SUCCESSFUL ENTERPRISE - AND PROBABLY HAS NEVER EARNED A DIME BY WORKING FORM ANYTHING OTHER THAN A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT ONLY EXISTS BECAUSE OF THE TAXPAYER . IN OTHER WORDS, TAXPAYER MONEY PROVIDES FOR THE WELL BEING OF ALL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES REGARDLESS OF RACES.
SHAME ON YOU FOR EVEN CONSIDERING THIS TYPE OF EDUCATION. IT IS BASED ON LIES AND HAS NO BASIS FOR SUPPORT.
