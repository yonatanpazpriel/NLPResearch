I am writing to join the voices in opposition to the current proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum the California Department of Education is considering for adoption.
I implore you to NOT adopt a curriculum that is biased against Israel and ignores the Jewish American experience. The curriculum should be created to inform and create understanding and not be a political tool.
My children were both educated in the Sacramento public school system and my grandson will attend in the near future. My parents were both Holocaust survivors and I spend many hours each year sharing their stories with public and private school students.
Adopt a curriculum that fairly informs and does not create prejudice and hate.
Thank you,
