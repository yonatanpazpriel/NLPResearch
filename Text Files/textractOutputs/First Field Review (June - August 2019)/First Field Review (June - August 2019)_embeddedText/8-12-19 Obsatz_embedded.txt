You should clarify that Israel is a country where Jewish refugees from the MiddleEast and Northern Africa comprise the majority of the Jewish population. Israel is not an example of White privilege or European dominance. Rather, it should be discussed in context with other countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including the treatment of Palestinians in Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, etc... and whether those other Middle-Eastern countries have granted full citizenship privileges to Palestinians in their countries. Anti-Semitism also has a long history in California and must be included in the curriculum, including historical examples and recent examples, such as the Santa Diego County synagogue mass shooting and the Nazi graffiti in Santa Monica, the San Fernando Valley, etc.... I am distressed about the lack of a section about the Jewish minority in California, including the Russian and Persian Jewish refugees who fled religious persecution to settle here.
