Why is the California Department of Education considering promoting anti-semitism in our public schools? As a parent of small children, a Jew, and a resident of this state I am both horrified and appalled at this proposed curriculum. I fear I will not be able to send my children to public school in California as this curriculum will subject them to being singled out and harassed by their peers, not to mention that it will subject Jews across the state to increasing hostility. I would like to point out that presently, 60% of hate crimes in the US are anti-Jewish (Report on Hate Crimes released by the Uniform Crime Reporting Program of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)) while Jews account for only 1.4% of the population. I see no reason why the state of California would seek to increase this percentage through the indoctrination of our children in anti-semitism due to the efforts of fringe individuals, who do not represent how the overwhelming majority of Californians feel, and who are widely known as anti-semites and actively promote antisemitism.
I respectfully request: 1. That BDS and other anti-Israel bias be removed from the model curriculum. BDS has demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is an anti-semitic organization with the sole objective of destroying the State of Israel. This fact has been recognized around the world where it has been rejected by countries, municipalities, and universities. Recently, the US House of representatives also recognized this fact when it passed HRes246. 2. That the curriculum be modified to include the history of Jews in America, the 2000-year historical persecution of Jews around the world including the Holocaust, oppression in the Arab world, as well as in Europe in general. (Ask yourselves how and why this was completely omitted? Why is Jewish history and oppression being erased?)
The introduction of the model curriculum states,
"The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."

This is a wonderful goal and idea which I fully support. Let's do that even, if it means treating Jews with the same respect, inclusion, and consideration, we accord all other peoples.
My specific concerns are backed up by the facts detailed below.
Thank you for your consideration. Dan Goldman
From Page 2 of the Glossary and Bibliography The following definition is patently false and ignores the culpability of Palestinians and the Arab world in the conflict. There are a number of prominent Arab voices that are opposed to BDS including Sarah Idan, the former Miss Universe Iraq, Fred Maroun, Author, Demi Tayeh, Israeli Arab activist, Maajid Nawaz, journalist. Why are even Arab voices opposed to BDS being silenced?
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.

From Page 234 of Sample Course Models. To some extent this list reads like a who's who of anti-semites today. Why does the curriculum promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to prevent terrorists from entering that country to murder innocent civilians and US policies on the border with Mexico. There is a long, prolific, and sad history of Palestinian mass murders of Israeli civilians. There is no such history of Mexicans doing the same in the US nor is there a comparable justification for the current administration's policies. As I mentioned above, BDS is a known anti-semitic organization that promotes the destruction of the State of Israel. It does not promote peace and co-existence. Why does the curriculum not include inclusion? Why are there no opposing viewpoints? Would we also consider adding to the curriculum Mien Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, 2 books that are widely distributed in the Arab world � why doesn't the curriculum include that fact? Why is Jewish oppression and anti-semitism in the Arab world being erased?

From Page 237 of Sample Course Models. It's fine to teach about Arab history as it is to teach about the history of all peoples. Why is there no comparable section on Jewish history? Why is Jewish history being erased? What is IsraelPalestine?
 Teacher distributes the "History of Arab Immigration to the United States" handout to students the day before the lesson. Depending on time, teacher can either have students read the handout for homework or as a warm up. Students are assigned to mark three points that surprised them and write out three questions they have after reading the handout.

 Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as "Arab," (e.g. predominantly Arabic-speaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)

 Teacher has students take out the handout that they read for homework along with their questions. Teacher asks students to share what points surprised them. Teacher collects their questions and uses them to inform the next day of teaching. (5-10 min)

From Page 242 of Sample Course Models. If we can teach about the Arab nakba why not about the Jewish nakba when 800,000 Jews were ethnically cleansed from the Arab world following the birth of the state of Israel? Are their lives worth any less? Why is that 3,500 year history and connection to the land of Israel being erased?
The influx of immigrants from outside Western Europe in the late nineteenth century provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year.
The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was smaller (less than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. Immigrants both Christian and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.
Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and considered their Arab identity politically central. The term "Arab" is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with

other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.

The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. Iraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

From Page 256 of Sample Course Models. Once again we see a completely one-sided, biased presentation of views meant to demonize Israel with no presentation of opposing views or even criticism of Palestinian leaders.
 Students read the article, Busta Apologizes for Releasing Arab Money where Busta apologizes for being racist. Afterwards, students reflect on whether or not artists should be held solely responsible for reinforcing stereotypes. If not, who and/or what should be? (10-15 min)
 Day 2: Teacher distributes song lyrics to the song, "Somos Sur" by Ana Tijoux and Shadia Mansour. Teacher introduces the song by explaining that:
"Somos Sur" is a song off Ana Tijoux's latest album "Vengo". She collaborated on this song with Shadia Mansour, who is an Arab hip-hop artist from Palestine. Ana is from Chile, where her parents were exiled under the dictatorship of Pinochet a few years before she was born in France.
 Students listen to the song and are instructed to do the following:

 Ana Tijoux is quoted as saying, "I feel that music is an amazing weapon, an amazing tool, like to have this reflection with the world. It's a conversation, a dialogue with the world."
