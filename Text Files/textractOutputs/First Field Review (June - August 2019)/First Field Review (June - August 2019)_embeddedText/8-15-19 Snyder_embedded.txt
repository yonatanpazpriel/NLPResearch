This ethnic studies model is essential for kids in California. I had the pleasure of looking through this model and seeing the roles of people of color come to the forefront in history. This is absolutely necessary for people of color to see people like them participating in society and this is absolutely necessary for the white population to have a better idea of the role of people of color. I teach in a largely affluent and white population and we need to do better to bring people of color to the forefront and this model will help me do that with the support of the state, rather than finding sources on my own. I will teach ethnic studies, but I would like to have a supported model to follow.
