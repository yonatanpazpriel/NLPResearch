After review of this draft of the ethnic studies curriculm, I, as a public school parent, was taken aback by the omission of discussion of the great
obstacles faced and contributions the Jewish community has made to California and this country. In addition, there was clear anti-Jewish bias in
the proposed document and discussions of controversial political moments regarding foreign populations � like BDS and the mention of Palestine/Israel � should absolutely NOT be any part of a guide to ethnic
studies for California kids.

Stephanie Ripps/public school parent

Pg. 1 � there is no mention/definition of anti-semitism Pg. 2 BDS � this is a very controversial political movement that involves complex issues outside of the United States. It feels completely inappropriate to bring up BDS at all in this course and I believe all mention of this movement should be removed since it is not a course about Middle East politics.

Pg. 234 � again, mention of Palestine, BDS or anything like that is not appropriate. This is a complex issue that belongs only in a class about the Middle East where these complex issues where many points of view can be properly studied. Here, it feels like propaganda that is being taught. 268-69 (lines 5802-03) uses the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land. GENERAL COMMENT: This proposed cirriculm has left out the Jewish experience entirely, does not address anti-semitism while it spends large amounts of time on other ethnicities, and � even more troubling � seems to promote views about movements like BDS which concern foreign countries and populations and should not be part of this curriculm unless that course is centered on properly studying Israell and the complexities of the Middle East. Like many concerned parents, I would like to see this curriculm re-done so that it is inclusive of the important Jewish experience and amended so that it does not unfairly propagandize about complex foreign affairs issues such as BDS.
