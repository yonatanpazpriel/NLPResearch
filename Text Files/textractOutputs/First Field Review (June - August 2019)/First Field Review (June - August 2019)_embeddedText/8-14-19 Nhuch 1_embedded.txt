Comment
While SBE's "Guidelines for Ethnic Studies Curriculum" specify that the Ethnic Studies curriculum is to "be inclusive, creating space for all students regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, or citizenship, to learn different perspectives," California law is considerably broader adding that "no person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of ... nationality [or] religion" in any "activity conducted by an educational institution" too. CA Education Code Section 220.
The SBE cannot adopt "any instructional materials...that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation..." and teachers cannot "give instruction ... that promotes a discriminatory bias" on the basis of these groups. CA Education Code Sections 51501 and 51500.
"Descriptions, depictions, labels, or rejoinders that tend to demean, stereotype, or patronize minority groups are prohibited." "Instructional materials containing references to, or illustrations of, people must portray accurately, to the extent possible, the roles and contributions of a fair proportion of diverse ethnic groups, especially" Native Americans, African Americans, Mexican Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, and European Americans." "CA Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content."
This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised:
Suggested correction: Jews should be included on this list of discrimination after 9/11. Jews were accused of plotting the 9/11 attacks, Jews have been accused of being responsible for the slave trade when in fact Jews were a big part of the Civil Rights Movement in America

This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised:
� Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico

Suggested correction: There is no comparison between the Mexican border to the wall between the Palestinian territories and Israel. Until the wall was erected, Palestinian terrorists were coming into Israel and committing daily homicide bombings blowing themselves up in bars, buses, discotheques, weddings, Passover seder halls. Since the wall was erected and checkpoints put in place, the suicide bombings stopped.

This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised: Ilhan Abdulahi Omar
Suggested correction:
In many occasions Ms. Omar has made discriminatory allegations regarding Jews in America. "It's stunning how much time US political leaders spend defending a foreign nation even if it means attacking free speech rights of Americans." It's fair to say that is also stunning how much time Ms. Omar spends attacking Jewish participation in American politics. Omar also wrote six inflammatory words "It's all about the Benjamins baby," adding a music note emoji to the end of her tweet. You can criticize AIPAC without being anti-Semitic. However, when you focus on AIPAC as the example of money in politics, or link Jewish influence to deep pockets, that's when it becomes a problem.

This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised: Helen Thomas a known antisemite
Suggested correction: Helen Thomas gave an interviewing telling Jews to leave "Palestine" and go back to Poland, Germany and America,where they belong, ignoring that half of Israel's population is made of Jews expelled from North Africa, Iran, Iraq, Lybia, etc. Evidence bellow. https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=51&v=RQcQdWBqt14

This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised: It is discriminatory because it only mentions names of people who are against Israel or Jews.
Suggested correction: I suggest that not only you remove these names from your list because these people do not promote inclusiveness nor acceptance of others. Instead you can give wonderful examples of Muslims who advocate for peace, understanding, acceptance and co-existence: Nemat Sadat, Ed Husain, Dr. Tawfik Hamid, Tashbih Sayyed, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, Irshad Manji, Salim Mansur, Abdurrahman Wahid, Mithal al-Alusi, Kasim Hafeez, Abdullah Saad Al-Hadlaq, Zuhdi Jasser, Khaleel Mohammed, Nadiya Al-Noor, Noor Dahri and Farooq Haider Khan. In the Muslim world support of Israel and Jews is a minority orientation, and these supporters have faced opposition and violence.

This part is discriminatory and so needs to be revised: Nakba
Suggested correction:
Nakba, or trajedy, is the name Palestinians give to the day that two states, by majority vote on the United Nations in 1947.one Arab one Jewish, were established in the land called, by the British after WWII, as Palestine, It is important to teach that on that day, 5 Arab countries declared war on the newly established Jewish state. The Arab Palestinians did not agree with the partition of Palestine and were told to leave by their Arab neighbors, since they were going to throw all the Jews into the sea. Even though five countries tried to drive the Jews out, the Palestinian Jews won that war. Had it gone the other way and the Jews had lost that war, it would have been a complete genocide of the Jews. That was the Nakba, and self inflicted one. They should have accepted the 1947 UN partition and lived with their own state since then.
