Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
� I support including of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. As an American Jew, I specifically support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
� To exclude discussion of a specific marginalized community is to further marginalize them. In other words, it is racist
