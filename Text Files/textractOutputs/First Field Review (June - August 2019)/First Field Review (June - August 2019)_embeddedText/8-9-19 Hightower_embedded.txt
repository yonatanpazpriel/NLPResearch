I noted the absence of any reference to Jewish Americans or the holocaust. Due to the rise of Antisemitism among white nationalist extremist groups, recent acts of domestic terror against this community in the US merits inclusion and analysis. The term Antisemitism must be included in the glossary, as well.

I am heartened by the inclusion of BDS in the glossary and a sample lesson plan. Throughout our history the power of the boycott (a form of free speech) to result in real and lasting social change domestically (Montgomery Bus Boycott) and internationally (South African Apartheid) is well established. I am certain that you will receive many comments falsely claiming that BDS is antisemitic. The conflation of criticism of the Israeli government's marginalization and persecution of the indigenous Palestinian people with antisemitism must stop. For decades, Israel has been seizing Palestinian territory, evicting Palestinians from their homes so that Israeli settlers can confiscate them, limiting Palestinian movement between the West Bank and Gaza and Israel proper, extrajudicially killing and wounding an unarmed civilian Palestinian population, and arresting and jailing Palestinian children, in contravention of international law.

US government has regularly vetoed decisions taken and proclamations issued by the world community (via the UN Security Council) against Israeli policies, many times as the sole voice of dissent. I hope that you will not yield to pressure from the Israeli lobby to let this conflation of criticism of the illegal actions of the Israeli State with antisemitism stand. It has been an effective tactic for so long, but simply defies logic and fact. There are many American Jews who are quite vocal in their opposition to the policies of Israel toward its Palestinian population (e.g., Jewish Voice for Peace) and who see through this disingenuous conflation.

The term Antisemitism must be included in the glossary and some examples of curricula addressing the holocaust and Jewish diaspora, as well as the rise of antisemitism domestically and internationally is absolutely necessary.
