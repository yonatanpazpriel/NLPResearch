I wish to echo the concerns of several others regarding the exclusion of the Jews among American ethnic groups as well as the distorted presentation of the Arab-Israeli conflict. As a long-term faculty member at UC Berkeley who also is a member of the board of Berkeley Hillel, I am well aware of the challenges that face Jewish students on the Berkeley campus as well as the polarization of views on the conflicts in the Middle-East. This proposed study guide should not make both issues worse. It would be unfortunate if a valuable effort to inform students about the ethnic diversity of California and the United States was distorted or undermined by these unfortunate lapses. Please reconsider.
