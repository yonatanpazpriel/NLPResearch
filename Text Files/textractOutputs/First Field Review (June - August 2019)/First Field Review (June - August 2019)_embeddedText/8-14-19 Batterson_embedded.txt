From: Wendy Levy Batterson Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment RE: The Jewish experience must be taught in the Ca. ethnic studies program
I am at California resident, US Citizen and taxpayer I am very concerned about the ethnic studies program leaving off a critical part of world history : the Holocaust and the Jewish experience throughout history up till the present day. Jews are a historically oppressed minority and should absolutely be included in California's ethnic studies program, as the lessons we've learned apply to everyone. To include pro BDS education whose goal is the destruction of the one Jewish state in the world and one true democracy & technically "free country" in the Middle East is not only antisemitism but anti-Democratic. I feel this is a concerted effort to undermine the Jewish people`s existence. As history has taught us Hate is a cancer that will metastasize and spread. We must continue to teach historical fact and consequences or we will keep repeating history causing unnecessary pain and suffering upon our population. Thank you for your attention to this critical issue . Wendy Batterson San Diego, Ca
