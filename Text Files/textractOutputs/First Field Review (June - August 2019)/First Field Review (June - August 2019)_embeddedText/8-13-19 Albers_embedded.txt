� The suggestion that the anti-Israel BDS movement is appropriate to teach as a positive social justice movement in a public school setting, let alone without a counter perspective, is unconscionable. o The founder of the global BDS movement is public in his desire to wipe Israel � the only Jewish state - off the map o This notion is predicated on the idea that Israel is an illegitimate or "apartheid state". On both fronts these are lies, plain and simple.  No different than any other people, the Jewish people have the right to self-determination � the idea that the Jewish people have no cultural, religious or physical connection to modern day Israel is false by any legitimate measure, a bold-faced lie, rooted in anti-Semitism.  In both real and relative terms, Israeli Arabs and Palestinians living in the territories are better off by just about every health (lifespan, infant mortality...) education, and income metric in comparison to both neighboring countries as well as Muslims living in Europe. Israeli Arabs enjoy more freedoms than any of their Arab neighbors and are represented in government. In the territories, 90% of Palestinians govern themselves. Not only is this the opposite of "apartheid", but: � a. cheapens the experience of those who endure actual apartheid, both past and present (including Palestinians who are experiencing apartheid right now in countries such as Lebanon, where there are laws restricting property rights and professional opportunities) � b. distracts the world from those actually responsible for Palestinian suffering � Hamas (a terrorist organization dedicated to the destruction of Israel and the West � NOT peace), Palestinian Authority (a corrupted organization that is led by Mahmoud Abbas, a Holocaust denier in his 14th year of a 5 year term), and Arab countries who perpetuate Palestinian statelessness through prejudice, codified into law that is true apartheid
� Israel is not without its' problems and is not above legitimate criticism � but so is every country. Unlike just about every other country, Israel is singled out on a global stage.

Israel is the legitimate home of the Jewish people. Apartheid does not exist in Israel and to teach otherwise, a complete double standard applied to the world's only Jewish state is anti-semitic � to be glorified in a classroom is abhorrent and shameful.
