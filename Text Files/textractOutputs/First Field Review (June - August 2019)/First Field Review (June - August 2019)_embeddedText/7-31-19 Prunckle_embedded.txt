I suggest you stop making everything about, race, sexual preference, socialism, revolution and give students here in Calif more basic "reading, writing, math & US history" Teach them how wonderful America is and that only Capitalism builds wealth for everyone who wants it.
I'm sure glad my kids are grown and don't have to be part of your "brainwashing"!
