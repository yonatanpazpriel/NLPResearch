I so disagree with the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum proposed for the California Education system. THis robs the children of their childhood by pushing adult decisions down their throat at an age when they are not prepared to reason things for themselves. There is time enough for this and anything else pushed at such early ages is really child cruelty.
Let's go back to preparing our kids for life and earning a living. They need reading, writing and math skills to get ahead in this world. Learning to write with cursive and not print is a better skill to teach as well. They can pick up the other things as they grow older and learn more about the world but without the basics they simply won't be able to succeed.
