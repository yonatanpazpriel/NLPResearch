From: Marlene Strauss Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 4:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies jiac; tony@tonythurmond.com; Tony Thurmond Subject: Be Fair to Jewish Americans
Dear Instructional Quality Commission:
Please amend the proposed ESMC to reflect an accurate picture of American Jews as an ethnic group that is the victim of racism and hate crimes. Two recent mass shootings at synagogues--one in California and the other in Pennsylvania--along with multiple anti-Semitic screeds published by gunmen should be enough to convince anyone that American Jews are repeatedly targeted by hate crimes and violence, and increasingly so.
It is alarming that the proposed ESMC is silent on this issue. The number of hate crimes directed toward Jews far exceeds the number of hate crimes targeting Muslims. Even worse is that the EMSC is not entirely silent on the subject of Jews. Instead, the curriculum is replete with anti-Semitic tropes and calls to take a stand against Israel, the latter of which isn't even in the purview of the curriculum.
American Jews have contributed much to the economic, scientific and cultural success of California, and will continue to contribute, if allowed to thrive peacefully. The hope is that the adoption of an ESMC will reduce hate overall and not unwittingly re-direct it toward Jews.
Sincerely, Marlene Strauss
