Dear Ethic Studies Division
Please do not allow the State Education Department to eliminate Jewish people from ethnic studies curriculum, where they have always been included alongside Hispanic, Muslim, Arab, African-American and other "minority" communities.

Arab and Jewish immigration experiences?
That's hypocritical.
Right now, in the United States, a growing white supremacy and anti-Semitic movement on the right are attacking Jews and Israel. A growing anti-Semitic and anti-Israel leftist minority is also attacking Jews and Israel. Jews are being murdered in their places of worship across the country and world (for example, Poway, CA and Pittsburgh, PA synagogue mass murders for most recent reference). It would be a terrible injustice to exclude Jews from consideration as a discriminated "minority" group.
Some people would argue that Jews are the "original minority" given that they were exiled from their homeland by the Romans in the first century of the common era and their wandering community has been chased, raped, murdered and pillaged around the world (primarily Europe) for nearly two thousand years until the re-birth of their nation, Israel, 70 years ago.
The Russian pogroms, Spanish Inquisition, and Nazi Holocaust are only three of the most well known example of the hatred exhibited towards the Jewish people. Many other lesser antiSemitic surges have also happened around the world, including the Middle East and right here in the United States.

In addition, it is a totally offensive and incorrect misrepresentation to include Palestinian-led "Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions" (BDS) political movement in any state curriculum "glossary of terms" since that movement labels Israel as an "apartheid state."
While the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not without blame on both sides, the term "apartheid" is totally inappropriate and implies a foreign colonizer subjugating an indigenous people. The Jewish people, descendants of the exiled Israelites, have an equal and "original" right to the land, as do the Palestinian people. Arab leadership has rejected that right for nearly 100 years. Suggesting that the Jews are colonizers is outrageous and unfair.
The Palestinian Authority continues to make no attempt to educate its people towards peace and coexistence with Israel. On the contrary, from every possible platform it repeatedly rejects Israel's right to exist, presents the conflict as a religious battle for Islam, depicts the establishment of Israel as an act of imperialism, and perpetuates a picture of the Middle East, both verbally and visually, in which Israel does not exist at all. Israel's destruction is said to be both inevitable and a Palestinian obligation. BDS is a hateful program aimed specifically to undermine the legitimacy and eradicate the existence of the State of Israel. Reference to BDS must not be included in our children's school curriculum.
And, by the way, the United States House of Representatives recently overwhelming passed a resolution confirming such unfair treatment and designation of the Jewish State of Israel (by 92% majority).
In my comments above, I am referring to the following documents and pages: � - Glossary: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions � - Chapter 2: Pages 234, 237, 242, and 264-269 � - Palestinian Media Watch
Thank you for your immediate consideration to correct these oversights and errors.
Regards, Bruce Richmond
