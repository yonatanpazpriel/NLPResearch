BS"D
To Whom It May Concern;
Is it true that the proposed high school curriculum is biased against Israel and that it will be promoting the BDS campaign against Israel? Have we Jews not suffered enough with the holocaust and pogroms and persecution throughout history? Is this what America stands for, attacking a little country (not much bigger than the state of New Jersey) that already has so many enemies within and without that aim for its destruction? America has always been the nation that protected the little guy against the bigger bullies! Are we not all God's people? I trust that your wisdom, fairness, and goodness will prevail over these old, ancient and deplorable anti-Semitic attitudes. Heaven forbid that we should be promoting anti-racial prejudice in our schools!
