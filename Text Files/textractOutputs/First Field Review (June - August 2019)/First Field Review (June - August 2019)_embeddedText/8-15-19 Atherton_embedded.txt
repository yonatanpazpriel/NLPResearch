8 Astonished that I was unaware of the nature of this project until just before public comment (also 9 unaware) closed.
10 Absence of comment reflects that either:
11 I didn't have enough expertise or experience to comment responsibly,
12 or
13 the item or concept appeared to have integrity in context of the curriculum being proposed and/or 14 in the broader context of students' lived and about to be lived experiences.

Glossary

33 A

34 Acculturation- the process of taking on another group's culture. And of being 35 fluid...multi-culturally capable and fluent in manners, customs, language.

36 Activism- informed action or involvement as a means of achieving a political goal. 37 Activism can manifest in the form of protests, demonstrations and direct actions, art and 38 cultural production, lobbying and advocacy work, fundraising, writing, educational 39 discussions, etc.

40 Agency- the capacity of an individual to act freely and make independent choices in any 41 given environment.

42 Accompliceship- the process of building relationships grounded in trust and 43 accountability with marginalized people and groups. Being an accomplice involves 44 attacking colonial structures and ideas by using one's privilege and giving up power and 45 position in solidarity with those on the social, political, religious, and economic margins 46 of society. An accomplice supports with her treasure; time, space, life, the vital interests 47 of the person or group needing active allies. Not limited to anticolonial struggles. This is 48 in contrast to the contested notion of allyship which is often performative, superficial, 49 and disconnected from the anticolonial struggle. An effective ally might offer one of the 50 treasures listed above. The Allies in WWII were not superficial.

51 American Indian- a member of any of the indigenous peoples of the western 52 hemisphere, except those distinguished as Eskimos or Inuits. The exclusion of 53 Eskimos and Inuits needs clarification.

54 Androcentric- the privileging and emphasis of male or masculine interests, narratives, 55 traits, or point of view, often in spaces where power is wielded.

56 Anthropocentrism- the belief that human beings are the most important entity or species 57 in the universe or human-centeredness.
58 Asian and/or Pacific Islander (API)- An identity marker often used in the United States to 59 describe people of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.
60 Assimilation- the process whereby a historically marginalized person or group 61 voluntarily or involuntarily adopts the social, psychological, cultural, and political 62 characteristics of a dominant group. An assimilated person may lose or bury their 63 previous cultural traditions and language, etc.
64 B
65 Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently 66 aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by 67 tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led 68 movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government 69 until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for 70 the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies 71 associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, 72 universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel 73 and its companies. And finally, the third component--sanctions--asks international 74 governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and 75 military agreements, among other measures.
76 C
77 Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on 78 a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. 79 Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as 80 research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately 81 exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated 82 from human labor and everything is commodified.

83 Character- A combination of qualities (i.e. mental, moral, ethical, etc.) that render a 84 person distinctly unique.
85 Chicana/o/x- A contested social and political identity chosen by people living in the 86 United States with Mexican and indigenous ancestry. The term with the `x' is 87 pronounced with an `-ex' sound at the end of the word.
88 Cisgender- a person whose chosen gender identity corresponds with their sex assigned 89 at birth.
90 Cisheteropatriarchy- a system of power that is based on the dominance of 91 cisheterosexual men.
92 Citizenship- a status granted to a person that has been recognized by a particular 93 country as being afforded all the benefits, rights, freedoms, and access as a member or 94 citizen of the country. Citizenship is also the relationship a person maintains with the 95 country or state they are loyal to. Thus, citizenship also includes how citizens engage 96 their communities through both political and non-political processes for the betterment 97 of their community, state, and nation.
98 Class- a category and identifier that denotes a person or group's economic or social 99 status. Too narrow. Class includes attitudes towards people, the community and the 100 environment.

108 Community Responsive Pedagogy- the practice of teaching with the objective to meet 109 the needs of a community. It is an approach of teaching to recuperate the education and 110 learning of often marginalized diverse students in order to improve themselves, their 111 families and their respective communities.
112 Counter narrative- refers to the narratives that arise from the vantage point of those who 113 have been historically marginalized. The idea of "counter" implies a space of resistance 114 against the status quo.
115 Consciousness raising/Conscientization- the enhancement of one's knowledge, 116 awareness, and concern around a particular social and/or political issue in order to 117 advance social change.
118 Critical race theory (CRT)- while manifesting differently, CRT is often engaged to offer a 119 critical analysis of race and racism within a particular discipline, field, system of power, 120 culture, etc. CRT draws on a collection of critical frameworks to better understand how 121 race and racism are interwoven into the fabric of American society.
122 Culture- the characteristics, creations, and knowledge of a particular group of people, 123 place, or time. These characteristics include, but are not limited to, beliefs, customs, art, 124 music, language, traditions, and religion.
125 Cultural appropriation- the adoption of elements of a culture (i.e. clothing, jewelry, 126 language/slang, iconography, textiles, sacred traditions, etc.) other than your own (often 127 historically marginalized groups), without knowledge or respect for the original culture.
128 Culturally responsive/relevant teaching- a student-centered pedagogy that is grounded 129 in cultural competence. This method of teaching stresses the importance of educators 130 being culturally sensitive and actively working to include parts of their students' unique 131 cultures and backgrounds into all aspects of teaching and learning.
132 Cultural retention- the act of preserving or retaining the culture of a specific group of 133 people, in particular the cultures of those that have been historically marginalized, or 134 cultures that are feared of being lost or erased for a multitude of reasons.
Page 5 of 23

135 Cultural revitalization- is a process through which unique cultures regain a sense of 136 identity through promoting heritage, languages or reviving traditions and customs.
137 Cultural wealth- critical education scholar Tara Yosso introduced the term "cultural 138 wealth" in 2005 in her work, "Whose Culture has Capital? A Critical Race Theory 139 Discussion of Community Cultural Wealth." The term speaks to a broader framework 140 that encompasses various forms of cultural capital--aspirational, linguistic, familial, 141 social, navigational, and resistance-- that are used to empower people. More 142 specifically, the framework is used to better understand and describe what knowledge, 143 experiences, adversities, strengths, etc. students of color bring with them to educational 144 settings. See also Pierre Bourdieu...prolific seminal writings on cultural capital.
145 D
146 Decolonization- the process of undoing colonialism. In the very literal sense, 147 decolonization it is the act of formerly colonized countries working to establish their own 148 independence. However, decolonization or decolonize is frequently used to describe the 149 un-learning of hegemonic and oppressive systems, practices, and ways of being in the 150 quest for self-determination.
151 Dehumanization- when a person or group of people are deprived of human qualities. 152 This process is often carried out when a dominant group abuses power and denies 153 opportunities and rights from another group.
154 Democracy- a form of government in which the people maintain political power and 155 have the ability to express their politics and views, and vote freely in an electoral 156 process.
157 Diaspora- is the voluntary or forcible dispersal/movement of peoples from their 158 homelands into new regions.
159 Double Consciousness- This term was first coined by W. E. B. Du Bois in The Souls of 160 Black Folk to describe how an individual's identity might be divided into several facets or 161 levels of consciousness. As a theoretical framework, double consciousness reveals the
Page 6 of 23

162 psycho-social divisions in American society, it describes the feeling of having a double 163 identity or "twoness". Thus, individual's see themselves through their own eyes and lens 164 and also through the eyes of others and society more broadly. 165 E
166 Empathy- the ability to understand another person's thoughts, experiences, and feelings 167 from their point of view.
168 Empire- A group of nations, states or territories, or a major political unit that is controlled 169 by a single government, leader, or military dominion. Within the field of Ethnic Studies, 170 scholars often study the implications of Western empires and expansion on people of 171 color globally.
172 Enculturation- the process of learning one's own group's culture.
173 Environmental racism- is a type of discrimination where people of low-income or 174 minority communities are forced to live in close proximity of environmentally hazardous 175 or degraded environments, such as toxic waste, pollution, and urban decay.
176 Ethnicity- an identity marker based on ancestry, including nationality, lands/territory, 177 regional culture, language, history, tradition, etc., that comprise a social group.
178 Eurocentric/Eurocentrism- a worldview that privileges and centers the thoughts, 179 practices, knowledge, history, systems of beliefs, and customs of the western world and 180 people of western European descent more specifically.
181 Equality- is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated 182 group have the same status in certain respects, including civil rights, freedom of 183 speech, property rights, and equal access to social goods and services.
184 Equity- unlike equality where everyone is treated the same, equity is providing students, 185 and people in general, with what they need to thrive. Equity is the promotion of fairness 186 and takes into consideration different backgrounds, learning styles, and material 187 realities to account for what each individual student needs to succeed.

188 F
189 Federal recognition- a status granted to Native American tribes that have gone through 190 the process of being recognized by the U.S. federal government and have been granted 191 sovereignty. There are over 300 federally recognized tribes across the U.S.
192 Filipina/o/x- an identity marker for people who identify as having ancestry in the 193 Philippines. Instead of using Filipina or Filipino, the "x" renders the term gender neutral. 194 The term with the `x' is pronounced with an `-ex' sound at the end of the word.
195 First Peoples- any of the indigenous peoples or Indian/Native communities of Canada.
196 G
197 Gender- western culture has come to view gender as a binary concept, with two rigidly 198 fixed options-- men and women. Instead of the static binary model produced through a 199 solely physical understanding of gender, a far richer tapestry of biology, gender 200 expression, and gender identity intersect resulting in a multidimensional array of 201 possibilities. Thus, gender can also be recognized as a spectrum that is inclusive of 202 various gender identities.
203 Genocide- the intentional systematic destruction of an entire national, ethnic, racial or 204 religious community. Moreover, the United Nations offers a much more expansive 205 definition of this term that encompasses the various ways in which genocide manifests.1
206 H
207 Hate crime- according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), a hate crime is 208 defined as "a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part
1 The United Nations defines genocide as, "any of the following acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, such as: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

209 by an offender's bias against a race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, 210 gender, or gender identity."
211 Hate incident- while similar to hate crimes, hate incidents are acts of bias against race, 212 religion, disability, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, or gender identity, however, they 213 do not meet the legal definition of a crime.
214 Hegemony- the dominance or influence of one group over another, often supported by 215 legitimating norms and ideas. Hegemony describes the dominant position of a particular 216 set of ideas and their tendency to become commonsensical and intuitive, thereby 217 inhibiting the dissemination or even the articulation of alternative ideas.
218 Herstory- is a term used to describe history written from a feminist or women's 219 perspective. Herstory is also deployed when referring to counter narratives within 220 history. The prefix "her" instead of "his" is used to disrupt the often androcentric nature 221 of history.
222 Heteropatriarchy- a system of society in which men and heterosexuals (especially 223 heterosexual men) are privileged, dominant, and hold power.
224 History- the study of the past, including, but not limited to: events, people, cultures, art, 225 languages, foreign affairs, and laws.
226 Homophobia- discrimination, dislike, prejudice, hatred, and a range of other negative 227 feelings and/or actions expressed towards people that identify or are perceived as gay, 228 lesbian, bisexual, or queer.

232 Human Rights- are the inalienable and basic rights that belong to all human beings from 233 birth until death, these include: freedom, democracy, liberty, education, water, shelter, 234 etc.
Page 9 of 23

235 Hxrstory- pronounced the same as "herstory," hxrstory is used to describe history 236 written from a more gender inclusive perspective. The "x" is used to disrupt the often 237 rigid gender binarist approach to telling history.
238 Hybridities- a term used to describe the crossing, intersection, and mixing of two or 239 more distinct cultures, often to form new identities.
240 I

248 Indian- relating to or denoting indigenous peoples of North, Central, and South America, 249 especially those of North America. Historically the term has been used as a slur or 250 pejorative, however, there are some indigenous people that have reclaimed the term. 251 For example, the use of "California Indian" has become more common to describe 252 Native Americans in the state.
253 Inequality- is the existence of unequal opportunities and rewards for different social 254 positions or statuses within a group or society.
255 Inequity- lack of equity; unfairness; favoritism or bias.
256 Indigeneity- while "indigenous" has been used to describe people who are native to a 257 specific land or locale, indigeneity builds upon that definition. Indigeneity is a framework 258 and practice of seeing and understanding the world through an indigenous lens.
259 Indigenous- refers to the native and original people of a particular land or territory.

264 Internalize- the process of absorbing or incorporating often external beliefs, values, 265 attitudes, and/or behaviors into one's nature and consciousness.
266 Intersectionality- an analytic framework that is used to describe how the interlocking of 267 systems of power disproportionately impacts those with multiple marginalized identities.
268 Institutional racism- the systemic normalization or legalization of racism and 269 discrimination. This often emerges via the unequal and inequitable distribution of 270 resources, power, and opportunity. Institutional racism is also referred to as systemic 271 and/or structural racism.

277 L
278 Latina/o/x- terms used to identify men (Latino) and women (Latina) with ancestry in 279 Latin America--Spanish speaking countries in the Caribbean and Americas. Latinx 280 differs from Latina/o as the "x" renders the term gender-neutral and more inclusive. 281 Thus, the term can be used by women, men, gender non-binary and trans identifying 282 people. The term with the `x' is pronounced with an `-ex' sound at the end of the word.
283 LGBTQIA- lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual.
Page 11 of 23

284 Liberation- the state of freedom. Within the context of Ethnic Studies, liberation is often 285 used to describe social movements (i.e. Black Power, BDS, and others) whose aim is to 286 achieve freedom through equal rights and justice.

292 Mestiza/o- a term used to identify someone of mixed race ancestry, often European and 293 Native American or Latin American. There are many other mixed race combinations 294 that aren't mestiza/o.
295 Microaggression- a small or subtle comment or action that consciously or unconsciously 296 expresses a prejudiced attitude, bias, derogatory, or hostile attitude towards a member 297 of a historically marginalized group. Not all perceived microaggressions originate as 298 hostile or derogatory. Learning how to receive or respond suspect comments will go a 299 very long way towards polishing everyone's dialogue.
300 Migration- movement of people, voluntarily or involuntarily, from one region to another.
301 Multidisciplinary- research conducted by educators and scholars from different 302 disciplines that are working collaboratively and drawing on each other's disciplinary 303 expertise for a particular project.

Page 12 of 23

308 Nepantlas- is a N�huatl word that was adopted by Chicanx writers, scholars, and 309 feminists to describe an "in-between space." Chicana feminist, Gloria Anzaldua, was 310 among the first to advance theorizing on the term, defining it as, a precarious space 311 where transformation can occur. The term can be used to describe a variety of identity312 related issues, including, race, gender, language, etc. Nepantla is the recognition of 313 confusion, chaos, and messiness in one's understanding of self and the world. Nepantla 314 also provides room for self-reflection to better understand and work through this liminal 315 space.
316 Net worth by race- the disparity or inequality of wealth among races, specifically when it 317 comes to financial capital in resources, income and savings.
318 O

Page 15 of 23

381 speech with a three-prong argument, the speaker might start in one position for their 382 first argument, move to another end of the room for the second, and shift to another 383 position for the third, creating a triangle.
384 Stereotype threat- according to psychologists Claude Steele and Joshua Aronson, 385 stereotype threat is, "being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative 386 stereotype about one's group." Within the context of their research, Steele and Aronson 387 studied Black and White students' performance on academic tests. They concluded that 388 because Black students are often stereotyped as inherently "less competent" or lacking 389 intellectual capacity, they would at times feel a desire to disengage from the learning 390 process and perform those negative stereotypes, thus, impacting their performance on 391 academic and standardized tests.

405 W
Page 16 of 23

406 Whiteness- a social construct that has served as the foundation for racialization in the 407 United States. Whiteness is the antithesis of Blackness, and is commonly associated 408 with those that identify as white. However, Whiteness is much more than a racial 409 identity marker, it separates those that are privileged from those that are not. Whiteness 410 can manifest as a social, economic, political, and cultural behavior and power. For 411 example, the "standard" or cultural "norm" are often always based on whiteness and by 412 extension white culture, norms, and values. 413 White supremacy- the belief that white people are inherently superior and represent the 414 dominant race. It is an operationalized form of racism that manifests globally, 415 institutionally, and through systems of power. 416 Womanism- a term that was coined by Alice Walker in response to mainstream 417 feminism's focus on White women. Womanism emerged as a distinct space to advocate 418 and fight for issues concerning Black women. 419 X 420 Xdisciplinary- The term signifying that Ethnic Studies variously takes the forms of being 421 interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, transdisciplinary, undisciplinary, and intradisciplinary, 422 in diverse academic and everyday contexts.
