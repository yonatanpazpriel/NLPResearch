I find this entire model curriculum to be preposterous. It does not nothing to promote actual education. It is quintessential ideological indoctrination on a grand scale. Charter schools, which already can't keep up with demand, will become the dominant force in education if garbage like this becomes the new education model. How utterly disheartening for California.
