I strongly urge the defeat of this measure as presently drafted. It does not family or even remotely fairly represent the contribution of Jews to our country. Moreover, it enhances the influence of organizations such as BDS whose clear goal is to harm Israel and American Jewry who support our only ally in the Middle East.
