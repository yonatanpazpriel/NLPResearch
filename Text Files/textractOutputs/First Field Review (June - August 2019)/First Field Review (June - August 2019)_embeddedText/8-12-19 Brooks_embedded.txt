Public Input Templateï¿½2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
May 2019 Draft
My comments are in red. I object to the overly critical bias of this curriculum. Education should be broad in its scope and comparative in context. From what I have read of this ethnic studies curriculum, it is an anti-American course to create bias against the norms, traditions and culture of people with traditional values and it is anti-family and traditional gender roles. It does not seek understanding, diversity of thought and acceptance of different people, but rather, anger and division.
One example, is capitalism; in curriculum that is unbiased then socialism and communism should be included to compare and contrast with capitalism. These economic systems impact people's ability for economic mobility in different ways.
Course Overview: This course is designed to help students develop an intersectional and global understanding of the impact of race and racism, ethnicity, and culture in the shaping of individuals and communities in the United States. They will learn about the interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that impact all people of color.
 Intersectional omits an the important cultural and philosophical aspect of religion's role in societal norms and practices. Looking at the major world religions can provide important context.
 In terms of global understanding, how do other countries compare to the US on race, ethnicity and culture. Does the curriculum study the impact of ethnic cleansing, persecution and genocide in the world today? What are the causes, affects and repercussions to these actions?
 The political elevation of the term "white privilege" is racist. If any other race, or group of people, were substituted for "white" it would be universally condemned. The very existence of racism is a learned behavior and examining "white privilege" crease a negative bias against the race of being born Caucasian. Your curriculum would be teaching racism.

 Who are the people groups defined as "white?" Classifying people based on their skin color and not nationality is so racist.
Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free
market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic
Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that
Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a
capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is
commodified.
 This definition is extremely inaccurate and biased.  Suggested definition: Capitalism is the accumulation of wealth from the
ownership of private property from which commerce can exist between people. Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty than any other economic system in the history of humans. As contrasted to other economic systems of socialism and communism, where commerce is controlled by the state, capitalism allows people to generate income through mutual exchange with the opportunity to create additional wealth through profits and income. The majority of businesses in the United States today are small businesses with less than 100 employees who leveraged their private property to create the capital to operate their business.
In conclusion, the curriculum is biased. This is not education for diversity and understanding, but rather the students will become angry, bitter and biased against mostly Caucasians and Americans with traditional family values. I teach entrepreneurial education and am disappointed to learn how anti-American this propaganda is.
