I am a parent to two children who will be educated in California public schools and I am writing to express my concern and disapproval regarding the proposed ethnic studies curriculum for the state of California. I wholeheartedly endorse a curriculum that supports open-mindedness, tolerance, acceptance, and learning the history of various cultures within our community. However, the proposed curriculum does not adequately do this when it comes to California Jews. Rather, it at best leaves us out of the picture, and at worst, promotes anti-Semitic misinformation, or one-sided propaganda. In light of the rise in global antisemitism and the recent heinous hate crime against Jews in our own state, I hope you will reconsider the proposed legislation, mindful of the real concerns expressed by the ADL and the California Legislative Jewish Caucus.
Thank you, Lizzy Chapman Los Angeles, Ca.
