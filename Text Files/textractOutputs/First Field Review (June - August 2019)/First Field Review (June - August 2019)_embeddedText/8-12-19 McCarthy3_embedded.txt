Overview

Line 20-25 Ethnic study course should cover all ethnic and racial groups and not just people of color. People of color should include whites. General comment- This course should cover how peoples of different nations are affected by racial and ethnic discrimination. This might cover Black on black discrimination in Africa, China Phillipino discrimination, etc. Line 31 Poor whites are also affected by these issues and should be covered in this text.

Line 39 and onward- This is a generalization re all peoples of color. The educational achievement gap differs substantially by different peoples of color and also affects white groups. This is obviously a biased statement. This course has an obvious bias based on this overview.
