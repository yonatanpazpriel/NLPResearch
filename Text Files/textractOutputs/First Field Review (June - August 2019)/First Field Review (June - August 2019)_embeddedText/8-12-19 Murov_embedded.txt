From: Blue Murov Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethic studies curriculum
Hello, I was upset to hear that the board is considering leaving out parts of the Arab American section due to pressure from outside Zionist groups. I am Jewish and I do not agree that telling the history of Arab Americans is anti-Semitic. In this critical period we need to work together. Erasing a people's history is not the way to move forward.
Sincerely, Blue Murov
