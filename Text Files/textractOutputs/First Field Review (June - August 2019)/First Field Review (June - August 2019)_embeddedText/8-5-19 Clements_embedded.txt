The claim that "Ehnic studies also gives students an appreciation of the contributions of multiple cultures, creating future global citizens." is invalid. Ethnic studies IS the cause of the current division in our country today. Let's keep it simple. A rainbow against a blue sky with all the different colors flowing in an arc is beautiful and amazing. If each color decides to go different directions, one north one south, one northeast ect., it would not be as beautiful, nor would it be as noticeable.

This curriculum will destroy the beautiful rainbow that our country is founded on, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. All men are created equally-this curriculum is designed to point out how some men are more equal than others. You are directed to identify which "color" of the rainbow, which you have no control over, you are. You are then taught how your "color" has been a victim and oppressed in the past and therefore how you matter more than the other men. This is wrong-ALL lives matter, just as much as your and my life, we are all equal under the Constitution. There can be no other possibility that

would be truly fair. The fact that your "color" has been treated equally in current reality is an inconvenient truth that is not mentioned in this curriculum.
Endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights-All men's rights come from God not from government. The Creator is God and God's Truth is unchanged and constant. God's Truth is the basis of the morals and values that the forefathers based the Constitution on. These morals and truths NEVER change just as God NEVER changes. The Constitution therefore will NEVER change. This curriculum is trying to change that ALL men are equal and directly contradicts the Constitution and God. Just as someone can deny the reality that there is gravity-the end result will be SPLAT! You can deny the reality that this curriculum causes division, but the end result will be DIVISION. Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness-Instead of scattering all the different colors of the rainbow into random directions the curriculum should be concentrating on the current reality we live in and have all the colors flow in the same arc together as they were intended. We accomplish this, like the forefathers designed, by striving to have ALL men equal. So, that ALL of us can have life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We have accomplished this in America! Stop teaching our youth that America is the problem when being proud to be an American is the goal that will pull all of us together into making a beautiful rainbow. There is no other thread, but being an American, that can pull us all together, that we ALL share! That should be your goal not division.
