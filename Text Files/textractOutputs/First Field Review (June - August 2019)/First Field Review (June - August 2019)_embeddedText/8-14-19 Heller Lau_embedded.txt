Dear CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education,
In response to your call for public comment on the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, I am submitting my response.
As a Jewish parent of 2 California Public School educated young men, as well as a politically and socially active Democratic voter, I am extremely dismayed about the proposed curriculum.
Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal, particularly in the national political environment that we are now living through. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel.
Considering the recent spikes in anti-Semitic rhetoric and behavior, I strongly urge you to remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others.
Sincerely,
Stacey Heller Lau
