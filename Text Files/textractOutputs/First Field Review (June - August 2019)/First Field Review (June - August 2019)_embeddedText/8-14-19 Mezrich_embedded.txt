From: Abe Mezrich Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 7:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California's High School
Dear Instructional Quality Commission, California Department of Education, and State Board of Education:
I am writing as a member of the Los Angeles Jewish community. I commend the Board of Education for mandating a new Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California's High Schools. But the draft under consideration will, I believe and fear, likely aggravate and throw fuel onto the growing fire of anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment in our State. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is tragic and complex, and is not reducible to a simple story of Israeli aggression. Similarly, endorsement of the BDS movement, which is rooted in the philosophy that the State of Israel simply shouldn't exist, is an implicit legitimization of Anti-Semitism, as it sanctions the claim that the Jewish people has no right to a state of its own.
Our Jewish community would welcome the opportunity to have a seat at the table as a new and better draft curriculum is devised. The current is unacceptably flawed, and will result in the opposite of the intended result, fanning hatred and discrimination, rather than fostering understanding and harmony.
Respectfully submitted, Abe Mezrich
