Agenda concern � how can graduates and instructors compete and be positively constructive in the real world if they spend so much time on non-core social justice programs. This encourages a vast wasteland of people who can add nothing to the bread and butter world we live in. They don't farm, manufacture, provide meaningful services, but rather spend large amounts of taxpayer dollars to create twitter mongering snowflakes who are consumed with identifying evil in harmless traditions and new insight into how hurtful consuming juicy fruit gum is to a specific ancient eskimo living in a hut 500 miles outside of Unalaska village limits so all books referring to juicy fruit must be redacted for the next school year.
