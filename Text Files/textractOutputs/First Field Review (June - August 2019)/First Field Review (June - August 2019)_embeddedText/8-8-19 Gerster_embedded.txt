I just read an article about the new (to be required) ethnic studies curriculum for California high school students in the Santa Cruz Sentinel . As someone who teaches and writes about race and ethnicity, I feel compelled to respond to the two major issues addressed in the article. 1) Of course anti-Semitism should be addressed as a form of oppression, and 2) of course Israel's treatment of Palestinians should be addressed as a form of oppression. Teaching these two and all other race and ethnic studies issues should also present various perspectives, including experts' definitions of terms (here of various kinds of oppression so that students can discuss and understand what oppression is), and including historical perspectives (so students can discuss and understand the roots and the continuing animosities of why such oppression exists), and including specific instances of oppression with facts, not opinions, (for students to discuss and understand the nature of oppression from a human perspective).
