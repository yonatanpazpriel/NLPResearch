Comment (include page and line numbers
where applicable) This is a general comment based on experience. I am of the Dr Martin Luther King Jr. generation. He, and many of the rest of us, tried to unite us as a nation. My observation of ethnic studies is that it divides people. I saw a young "white" man change from accepting of many kinds of people to become a white nationalist. I asked him why. He explained that he was inspired in his ethnic studies class by reading Malcolm X, and by learning about who Israel allows to become citizens. And, the teacher gave everyone who looked "white" an "F". How will this mandatory ethnic studies class be graded? I don't want to see even more angry, arrogant people than we have now.

I know people who look "white" who can trace their ancestry back to slaves from Africa. I don't believe in race anymore. But I know we are all instinctively tribal. It was probably a survival tactic in the past. Instead of an ethnic studies course, which promotes contrasting one tribe vs. another, you should put "ethnic studies" in every class. Everyone loves heroes. Show off our "black" phenotypes, "brown" phenotypes, "asian" phenotypes, "white" phenotypes, and women as heroes and heroines in

fields you want your students to want to succeed in. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, sociology, literature, history, computer science, economics, etc.. And don't forget religions. We have Christian, Jewish, Muslim heroes I know of who have advanced our nation's civil rights or our scientific knowledge.
What is your final goal? When your students graduate, where do you want their loyalties to lie? If we don't put aside our differences and unite as one nation, we are going to end up like the people of Hong Kong. My sixth grade teacher taught us to set aside our different national and ethnic backgrounds in everything she taught, and to put our country first. It changed my life. Today I see selfishness, greed, anger, avarice, narrow loyalties, everywhere I look. Our problems today are bigger than World War II or the Cuban missile crisis.
