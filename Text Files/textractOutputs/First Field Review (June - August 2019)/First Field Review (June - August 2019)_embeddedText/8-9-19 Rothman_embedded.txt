As a citizen, a parent, and a grandparent, I am horrified by the omission of issues related to anti-semitism, BDS, and anti-Zionism in your proposed curriculum. I have grandchildren who have been harassed as Jews both in both the UC and the Cal State system, and grandchildren in the lower grades who are choosing to keep their religious identity private in order to protect themselves. While teaching at Cal, I have had students approach me for advice regarding BDS and anti-semitism they have experienced. To omit these issues is, in itself, an anti-semitic act on the part of the planners. Please address this ongoing and increasing problem and include these issues in your curriculum. PS � Teaching diversity and ethic studies was my field and I know it is a very challenging on. I do fully understand this � but I believe the idea of these programs is to be Inclusive not Exclusive!! Thank you -
