Good day,
I applaud the effort to include a course of ethnic studies in our high schools. However, I am dismayed by the language, or more accurately, jargon, that is used in the current document. The document reeks of political correctness to the point that it is unreadable. You've created "words" to suit instead of using existing vocabulary to instruct. What will teachers trying to work from this do?
The curriculum is also very one sided. Capitalism is not the only governing system that has oppressed people. To single it out in this document shows a lack of world awareness that is the very basis of this course.
I hope that significant changes will be made to this before it is put in use.
