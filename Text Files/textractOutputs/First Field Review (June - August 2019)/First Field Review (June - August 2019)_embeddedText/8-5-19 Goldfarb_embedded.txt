Glossary, Page 2: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions" and lists BDS while failing to offer critical perspectives. In an interview with Omar Barghouti, co-founder of BDS in 2015, Mr. Barghouti stated the following: "Ultimately, BDS aims to turn Israel into a pariah." Also, "We oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine... [only] a sellout Palestinian would accept a Jewish state in Palestine."

The Sample Lesson Plans Page 233: Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering Israeli cities to murder its citizens, with that of U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Page 234: Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, and offers no voices critical of their perspectives. Page 237: Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country Page 241: Presents only the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives, specifically how many Jews were expelled from Arab Countries that same year. Pages 256, 264, 267-269: Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public - a common, and false, Antisemitic slur.

The curriculum excludes Jews as an ethnic minority (currently estimated at 1.8% of the US population), doesn't list the word "antisemitism" in its glossary, and fails to note the ongoing persecution and acts of violence committed against Jews in the U.S. and world.
