From: sherri hoffman Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Your curriculum for schools
I have just been advised that you are trying to promote anti semitism against Israel. I am shocked. Please do not pass this. Our country has had enough shootings and burning of synagogues. Our country needs to come together and embrace diversity. What you are trying to do will cause more hatred and damage to our currently broken society.
Sincerely, Sherri Hoffman
