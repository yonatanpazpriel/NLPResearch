Page 2, Lines 29-40 If the whole point of this curriculum is to train students in seeing diverse perspectives in addition to using language that better represents the many peoples in our world, including the term "BDS" or "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions" as an official vocabulary term goes against that aim. It presents the Palestinian perspective as the only and established narrative and that of Israel as factually and uncontroversially that of an oppressor. That is not the case. BDS is a political movement and has no place in a required curriculum charged with inculcating and molding developing minds. It promotes intolerance and divisiveness, which go against the country's tenets and the concept of "E Pluribus Unum." It presents Israel as an apartheid state akin to the erstwhile South Africa, which is an opinion and not a fact. This does not present a balanced or factual view. The name of the course is "Ethnic Studies," but nowhere does it present Jews as an ethnicity, minority, race, or a People, a People who have faced millennia of oppression or, in the case of this country, centuries worth of it in the form of redlining and quotas and employment discrimination and slurs.

an inappropriate inclusion of a political issue into a curriculum that should responsibly expose students to facts. And if there is to be an inclusion of anything of this nature, it should be clear it is a political and controversial issue and that there are other sides to this. Never is the Israeli or Jewish perspective stated, and Jews, as mentioned, are never presented here as an ethnicity, which makes this inclusion Anti-Semitic rather than "Anti-Zionist." Never is AntiSemitism included as a term for a type of racism. That is a gross and offensive oversight and one that will misinform students and thereby catalyze further bigotry in the form of that Anti-Semitism. The whole point is to promote knowledge and tolerance: this proposed curriculum as is stands does neither and is thus dangerous.
