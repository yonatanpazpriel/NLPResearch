A Jewish friend of mine alerted me to this curriculum. Some think that it promotes an anti-Israel stance. And some of those people feel that antiIsraeli political stance can easily morph into anti-semitism on personal level.

I reviewed just briefly, and I do not even see the Jewish community included in the 4 groups. How is this even possible? The rise of the Nazi regime presents a major playbook for oppression that is mirrored in bits and pieces across all ethnic minorities.

2/3 of millennials don't know what Auschwitz is. Viz: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2018/04/12/twothirds-of-millennials-dont-know-what-auschwitz-is-according-to-study-offading-holocaust-knowledge/

Where I grew up, Jews were soft-redlined, ie realtors would not sell. My best friend's mom charmed her way into the community. And to her credit my mom embraced the opportunity to learn from each other--she came to Easter, I went to Seder, etc etc. She was not welcome at my swim club, even as a guest, until my mother raised cain. If one of the goals of ethnic studies is to understand power structures, you simply cannot white-out the Jewish community. From identifying them as others (apply to other ethnic groups) to mocking (cartoons) to dehumanizing them (applies across all ethnic groups) to isolating, denying rights, rounding up into camps, terrorizing... and finally murder: every manipulation of the major ethnic groups identified was exercised by Hitler. For the upper grades, I would use Hitler as the template. It would seem that teaching about/modeling "restorative justice" would be included if one goal of the curriculum includes creating empathy.
I find the absence particularly offensive because the Jewish community was a driving force behind the Civil Rights Act and put their lives on the line for Voter Registration. The community has been a strong ally of the black community--is that part of the curriculum?
