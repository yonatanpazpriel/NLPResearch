This model and guideline for instruction is over the top. Not all all parents share the same values or ideas that this model is promoting. This model pushes it's ideology and not in a way that allows our young, easily impressed learners to hear information, evaluate, and form their own opinions without being ridiculed or labeled a bigot or racist. These ideals are being forced on teachers, students and California's citizens. I do not believe this is a "guideline." I believe this is simply another way extremely progressive educators to indoctrinate our kids! They are pushing their opinions and beliefs on their students, other educators and society as a whole. Education should be about students eventually becoming independent, critical thinkers, who form their OWN opinions based on unbiased, neutral information. Stop indoctrinated our students and forcing your personal agendas!
