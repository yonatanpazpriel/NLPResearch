From: Vicki Mejia-Gewe Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 10:30 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Amend the ethnic studies bill
To whom it may concern,
I am writing in regards to the bill requiring ethnic studies classes for high school. As someone who has spent her life surrounded by people of many cultures and who teaches international students, I love the idea of such a requirement. However, I am concerned about the current form of this bill. The current suggested curriculum is too one-sided, not offering students a chance to make up their own minds about controversial issues. It lacks objectivity. Instead it encourages students to support only very liberal issues.
As a strongly liberal Democrat, I support many of the perspectives the bill encourages, but as an educator and citizen who hopes to see the future generation become critical thinkers, I firmly believe that they must be given a balanced perspective on the issues, encouraging them to make up their own minds what to believe and why.
Please amend this bill to reflect a more balanced, objective viewpoint on each of the social and political issues.
Sincerely,
Victoria Mejia-Gewe Glendale, CA
