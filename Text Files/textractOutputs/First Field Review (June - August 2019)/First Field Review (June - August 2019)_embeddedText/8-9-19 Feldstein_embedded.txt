I would ask the State of California for the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model Ethic Studies curriculum. The curriculum as proposed openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry.

The sole purpose of the BDS movement is the destruction of the State of Israel, and should not be legitimized in the education of our children. The sample lesson plan is strongly biased towards a questionable pro-BDS narrative without framing alternative perspectives and unbiased historical review and analysis. For example, the curriculum:
� Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234). � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234). � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).

� Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).
I would also urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.
This is an extremely important to issue to me because my high school children have been subject to increasing and alarming levels of anti-Semitism. There is a disturbing absence of education about the experience of American Jews as a historically marginalized and discriminated community. The model curriculum, if implemented, would only worsen the marginalization of our children and imprint around them an antiJewish and anti-Israel bias that they would sadly need to face as they make their lives in California.
