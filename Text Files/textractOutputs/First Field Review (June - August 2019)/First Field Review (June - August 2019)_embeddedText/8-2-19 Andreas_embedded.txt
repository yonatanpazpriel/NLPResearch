I am saddened, disgusted, horrified with your lack of good Judgement. What is your goal? What country is your model? What is better than what we have? I understand that you hate Trump. Hate Hate Hate. Hate is all that you want to teach. If anyone does not agree with you HATE THEM. You seem to back the Muslim community and thier religion and Hate the Christions. At least be CONSIST AND and EDUCATED. YOU HAVE PRINCIPALS OR YOU DON'T YOU CAN'T PICK AND CHOOSE!
