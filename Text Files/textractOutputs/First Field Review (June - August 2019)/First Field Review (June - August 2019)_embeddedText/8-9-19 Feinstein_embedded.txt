From: Robby Feinstein Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 10:35 PM To: IQC Subject: The Proposed Ethnic Studues Xyeeucuklum Is Clearly Anti-Semitic & Biased Agaiunst Israel
Dear IQC of the California Department of Education: My reason for writing to you is to protest against the fact that the proposed California Ethnic
Studies curriculum is anti-Semitic. It also singles out Israel, tjhe only democracy in the Middle East, for condemnation. Pubic education should be countering bigotry, rather than promoting it.
Sincerely yours, Robert Feinstein
