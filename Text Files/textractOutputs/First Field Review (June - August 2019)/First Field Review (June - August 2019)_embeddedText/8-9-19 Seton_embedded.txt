Ethnic `studies' blowback
A draft of a model ethnic studies curriculum posted by the California Department of Education is facing fire for leaning too far left and being biased against Jews, CalMatters' Elizabeth Castillo reports.
The comment period closes on Aug. 15, and it has drawn hundreds, many of them focused on Arab-Israel issues.
The curriculum's glossary includes definitions of Islamophobia and the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel but not anti-Semitism or the Holocaust.
� Capitalism is defined: "Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system."
Cisheteropatriarchy is "a system of power that is based on the dominance of cisheterosexual men."
Hxrstory, repeated throughout the draft curriculum, "is used to describe history written from a more gender-inclusive perspective. The `x' is used to disrupt the often-rigid gender binarist approach to telling history."
� In 2016, former Assemblyman Luis Alejo, now a Monterey County supervisor, carried legislation to develop an ethnic studies curriculum. It passed overwhelmingly.
� This year, Assemblyman Jose Medina, a Riverside Democrat, is carrying a bill to mandate ethnic studies as a high school graduation requirement.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond didn't have a hand in appointing the committee that drafted the proposal. But as the elected head of the Department of Education, Thurmond will be responsible for the final draft.
� Thurmond spokesman Scott Roark: "We are recommending edits."
