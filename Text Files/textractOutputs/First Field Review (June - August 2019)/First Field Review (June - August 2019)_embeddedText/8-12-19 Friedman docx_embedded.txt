As a long-time Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Riverside, I serve on my department's ethnic diversity committee (to promote inclusion) and I teach courses on the psychology of discrimination. I also supervise graduate students on such topics and have long advised and helped our many diverse undergraduates. Your proposed ethnic studies model curriculum is flawed and counter-productive because it pits ethnic groups against each other. For our California students to grow up living in harmony and cooperation, it is crucial that each student comes to understand the perspective of the relevant sides in all disputes, and to value all religious and ethnic diversity. This needs to start in the public schools. If you take only the perspective of the pro-BDS group regarding Israel and Palestine (as your draft does), you make things worse for everyone. And you push the conflict to continue. In addition, your attempt to push a singular, controversial narrative will backfire and will hurt the push for civil society and for peaceful conflict resolution in California and abroad.

For example, page 234,  Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine but does not present the opposing facts and discussions.
Also for example Page 242 frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War, with no alternative perspectives, thus making it more difficult to resolve this conflict.
