I do not support the overall presentation of the ideas of Capitalism as an oppressor expressed in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. They are onesided, narrow-minded, and completely ignore positive aspects of capitalism such as how it ended the conquest era, not only here, but worldwide. Here, we are no longer required to be born into status or to murder and pilferage to become rich. Now we have a legal way to become educated, get a job and experience, climb up, etc. No murdering, stealing, or conquering required.

Just like anti-vaccination groups have lost perspective on how horrible diseases were before the advent of vaccinations, people who have an overly one-sided negative slant on capitalism have completely lost sight of long term history and how things have vastly improved because of capitalism.

I urge the state of California to revise this curriculum.
