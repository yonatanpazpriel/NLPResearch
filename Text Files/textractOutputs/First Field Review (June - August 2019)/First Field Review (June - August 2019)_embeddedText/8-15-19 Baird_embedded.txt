Line 103 Several of the organizations listed are clearly racist themselves, particularly La Raza. It means "The Race". Views expressed by this group have called for brown power, Hispanic superiority, reclaiming California, etc. I'm persuaded that the influence of this and other groups has led this proposal in the wrong direction. It's time to follow MLK's dream that all people be treated equally. That means no special classes which try to rewrite History. Lines 32 � 38 These are made up words. California has an obligation to teach students about U.S. and World History � real events WITHOUT racist slants. Our civilization depends upon students knowing how we arrived where we are, and learning about DEMOCRACY in the America and the World. This made up curriculum will only serve to undermine this great nation we have inherited from our forefathers.

Line 39 � 53 This section implies that ALL students of color have suffered from dehumanization and other atrocities. This is simply a very negative stereotype pushed by a racist agenda. My students of color and not of color are all treated as human beings with natural rights of life, liberty, and property. Teachers like me encourage all our students to dream, try their best, and to succeed. This section lies to my students, telling them that they have been harmed when they have not been harmed. They have been blessed to live in the greatest nation, the most FREE nation ever on earth. Line 59-66 This section makes sense. However it is a duplication of Modern World History. Many teachers employ these strategies in their HSS classroom already. Lines 7 and more. The term "hxrstory" is offensive to students who have dedicated their academic careers to studying "history." This new term implies that there is something wrong with history. Advocates of implementing a H.S. Ethnic Studies course complain that the U.S. has been run by old white men. They ignore the facts that there is much wisdom with age, that these men created the most democratic government in the world, and that this system has continually become more democratic. Today all genders and racial groups enjoy the right to suffrage and other forms of political behavior. It is wrong to try to judge people from the past by today's standards. This curriculum guide tries to do just that. By looking at men and women who lived 50, 100, 200, even 300 years ago and judging them by todays standards, it simply is poor use of logic.
