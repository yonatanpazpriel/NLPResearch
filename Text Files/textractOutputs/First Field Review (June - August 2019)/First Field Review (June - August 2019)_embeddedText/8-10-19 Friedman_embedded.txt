From: Paul Friedman Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 8:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: CA Ethics Curriculum
Hello I am greatly opposed to this new curriculum as it is very biased and presents a deviation from traditional values and targets caucasian people (aka. "White" or "White males"). As I myself and my children are bicultural, this curriculum references that the Founding fathers are racist which is not the case as the USA was created on the principals of Freedom, life and liberty for all. This curriculum would be a great disservice to students. In fact, by me simply opposing this and sending this email, I fear for retaliation that I (and many who share the same views) face everyday when one goes against Liberal Far left agenda items such as this.
Please do not allow this to take place.
Sincerely, A concerned California Citizen and Educator.
