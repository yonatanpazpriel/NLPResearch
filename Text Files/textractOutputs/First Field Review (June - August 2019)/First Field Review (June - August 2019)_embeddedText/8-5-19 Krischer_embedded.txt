Page 2, lines 30-40. When describing a movement as controversial as BDS, it is important to explain both sides of the story. This explanation chooses only one side of the argument and presents it as fact. Numerous well respected and thoughtful academics, politicians and others have eloquently explained how the movement is not meant to achieve peace, but to undermine the existence of the State of Israel. To omit entirely any reference at all to the other side of the argument, or to the fact that the charter of Hama, in writing, says its objective is to wipe out the state of Israel, undermines rather than fosters critical thinking and analysis and also undermines the stated goal of eradicating bigotry.

Page 256, 264-69 encourage the use of a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel without referencing any positive commentary about Israel or criticism of the Palestinians.
