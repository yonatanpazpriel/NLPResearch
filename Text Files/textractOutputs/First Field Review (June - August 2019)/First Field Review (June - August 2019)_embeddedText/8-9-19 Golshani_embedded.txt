Glossary � includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. Page 234 � Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. Page 234 � Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. Page 237 � Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country.
Page 242 � Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. Page 256, 264-269 � Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders.

lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East (my own family's history), and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.
