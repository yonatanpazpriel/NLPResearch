Sir or Madam: Although I do not live in California, as a university instructor, I must object in the strongest terms to the proposed curriculum. The curriculum does not include anti-Semitism as its own category despite the seriousness of this ancient hatred and the fact that there has been a substantial increase in the number of anti-Semitic crimes in this country. In fact, according to the FBI, Jews, not Muslims, are by far the most targeted religious group in this country. While highlighting many other groups' contributions, this curriculum does not acknowledge the major contributions of Jews to this country. This is either a serious oversight or more likely an intentional bias on the part of those who wrote this curriculum. Furthermore, this curriculum presents the biased BDS movement in a very positive light. Why? BDS founders have openly said not that they seek peace and coexistence but that no Jewish state has the right to exist. Would this curriculum present in a positive light any other movement so fiercely biased against one nation's right to live in its ancient homeland? Of course not. BDS followers often bully and threaten pro-Israel students and teachers, and they harass performers planning to go to Israel. BDS has no interest in working with Israelis but rather seeks to stop all cooperation with Israel. BDS supporters recently harassed an Arab businessman in Detroit who wanted to open a halal Israeli burger chain. This man has been viciously targeted and lost business. How can BDS supporters justify hating Israel so much that they would ruin the business of an Arab businessman in this country? The curriculum also presents the creation of Israel in a completely inaccurate, one-sided manner. This is hardly objective education; this is completely politicized bias that has no place in our public-school education.
There are many problems with this highly one-sided and discriminatory curriculum; I can name only a few. I urge you to carefully review and revise this completely unacceptable curriculum and make substantial changes and additions before considering implementing it. It would do tremendous damage to the education system and to all students required to learn from the extremely biased views that it presents.
