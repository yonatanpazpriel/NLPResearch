I applaud the concept of an Ethnic Studies Curriculum as an effort to help students understand diversity and to aid in the eradication of bigotry and hate. I am deeply concerned about several aspects of this curriculum which I believe are biased and unbalanced and will actually misinform students and teachers. For example, it is concerning that there is an absence of discussion of Jews as an ethnic minority in the curriculum given the clear increase in anti-Semitism throughout the US and the world, as indicated by the shootings in Pittsburgh, PA and Poway, CA, among others.
Knowledge of the treatment of the Jews in the Holocaust, indeed even awareness and acknowledgement of the Holocaust as a true occurrence is quickly deteriorating and I urge you to include this important chapter of history so that students can learn from it.
I strongly agree with the concepts of tolerance and welcoming of diversity and inclusion in all its forms. I am concerned that this curriculum in its current form will create a hostile environment for Jewish students.
My daughter, who attended Lafayette public schools and later went to a liberal arts college in the Midwest, was actually fearful of expressing her support for the state of Israel because of the hostility on campus created by pro-BDS student groups.
I am deeply concerned that this process could extend to California public schools if this curriculum is adopted without changes to address these issues.

Glossary gives definition of BDS derived from BDS website but does not have full picture of this group, which is in fact linked to terrorist groups. Encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine but there is no voice critical of BDS. See below from https://forward.com/opinion/418744/bds-is-linked-toterrorists-just-as-you-suspected/: a report by Israel's Ministry of Strategic Affairs provided conclusive evidence that the energy of terrorists and their organizations has infiltrated, and is even driving, the BDS activities.
The report reveals direct ties between numerous boycott groups and US, Canada, and EUdesignated terror organizations such as Hamas and the Palestinian Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
"Hamas and PFLP operatives have infiltrated and adopted seemingly benign NGOs in the Palestinian Authority, Europe, North America and South Africa, for the purpose of advancing their ideological goal: the elimination of the State of Israel as the nation-state."

Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists at the border from carrying out suicide bombings which have occurred for years, and the US policy at the border with Mexico
The curriculum is biased against Israel, as indicated by suggestion to use a poem that is harshly critical of Israel, but there is no positive or balanced perspective on Israel and no criticism of the Palestinian leaders
Again, the curriculum is unbalanced and biased against Israel. It only presents the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 war and not Israel's narrative on this same war.
