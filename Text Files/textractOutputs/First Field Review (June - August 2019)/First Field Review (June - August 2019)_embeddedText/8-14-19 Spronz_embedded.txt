Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 1 omits a definition of antisemitism, and Page 2 includes an incorrect definition for BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions). BDS, although attempted to be couched in neutral terms, has as its purpose and effect the deligitimization of the peoplehood of the Jewish people, and therefore the contributions the Jewish people have made to the United States and the State of California.
Page 242 uses politically biased language referring to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-5161); and Pages 268-269 (lines 5802-5803) uses the antisemitc trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land. Imperative to add lessons about the history of Amercian Jews as an ethnic group and to point out that the largest number of hate crimes in the United States are committed against American Jews. Education is not political. Education is not indoctrination. The purpose of education is to teach students to think critically and independently using all the facts so that students can reach their own conclusions.
