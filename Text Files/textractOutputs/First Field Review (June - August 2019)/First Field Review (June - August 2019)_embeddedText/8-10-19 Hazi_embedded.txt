[Include the page and line number(s) here�I am extremely concerned by the proposed curriculum for the required "Ethnic Studies Program" in public high schools. The fact that Jews are omitted as an ethnic group, especially in these times when Jews and other ethnic minorities are being singled out, is unconscionable. The curriculum also presents a highly biased view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a classic sign of the "new anti-semitism" which is just an old hatred disguised amidst anti-Israel views. Not long ago in Charlottesville, white nationalists shouted "Jews will not replace us" as a protester was killed. The Poway synagogue shooting this year killed 11 Jews and was the most deadly anti-semitic attack in U.S. history. Moreover, the virulent and anti-semitic tropes found in the curriculum as it deals with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are deplorable. The "information" presented about the conflict is inaccurate and misleading. Information about the BDS movement is one sided and fails to mention serious problems with the movement, such as that the damage it inflicts mainly affects Israeli universities and academics as well as Palestinian owned businesses - https://www.jpost.com/IsraelNews/Palestinian-employees-hurt-by-BDS-speak-up-about-its-negativeeffects-560511 . I am most shocked, however, about the blatant singling out of one ethnic group and one country, Jews and Israel, in the guise of a program aimed at understanding and preventing ethnic and racial discrimination. I am an immigrant and do not support many of the policies of my native government, Argentina. However, singling out Argentina for specific censure amid hundreds of countries in the world would be ridiculous and obviously prejudiced. Yet it has occurred to no one in the group designing this program that singling Israel and its people for censure because of its government's policies while ignoring other countries, other conflicts, other human rights violations occurring every day is imposing a double standard that is anti-semitic in itself.

As a taxpayer and active voter I demand that an investigation be made as to the motivations behind the curriculum and its singularly biased perspective. Who prepared it. How was this singular bias allowed to continue? Why were opposing views not presented. Why, most glarignly, were Jews as an ethnic class not included in it? Hate crimes against Jews increased more than those against any other ethnic group in 2018, and represented the largest single growth of religious based hate crimes. https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-jewish-latino-hate-crimereport-20190703-story.html . For California's schools to present this curriculum change now in in itself proof of a growth in anti semitism that is as alarming as it is repulsive. I demand that the people responsible for this curriculum be identified and removed from decision making positions as quickly as possible.
