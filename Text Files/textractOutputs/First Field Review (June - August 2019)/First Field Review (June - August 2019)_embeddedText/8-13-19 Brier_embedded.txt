Look carefully at the L.A. Times editorial of Aug 4.
History has nothing to do with "his' or "her." Its etymology is connected with "learning." What the gender critics mean is "historiography," the writing of history. That does involve gender perspectives.
If we politicize ethnic studies, propaganda is inevitable. When education becomes propaganda, totalitarianism follows.
