Page 1-22 - Why is there a glossary? It is much more effective to use plain English, so we do not have to look at a constructed dictionary to understand the word being used. We can all understand English. It is recommended that the words that need to be defined in your glossary be replaced with plain English. You have already done this in your glossary! I will feel less marginalized if you do this. Page 1 - Accompliceship- the process of building relationships grounded in trust

and accountability with marginalized people and groups. Being an accomplice

involves attacking colonial structures and ideas by using one's privilege and

giving up power and position in solidarity with those on the social, political,

religious, and economic margins of society. This is in contrast to the contested

notion of allyship which is often performative, superficial, and disconnected from

the anticolonial struggle.

Beto O'Rourke has done this and looks foolish.

Use the word "accomplice". Modify it as necessary in your text to make your point.

Delete the word "allyship' from your definition. The sentence associated with it adds nothing to the definition which is recommended to be deleted.

The Whole Curriculum. This curriculum is antithetical to the whole concept of the United States. Please develop this idea regarding the United States as a country and culture. Specifically, the United States is based on the idea of "From One Many". The curriculum must explain why it is diverting from the concept of unity and emphasizing the concept of disunity as the curriculum emphasizes the various ethnicities, races, genders, etc. instead of the whole. With out this "Melting Pot", the United States is will diminish. It should be noted that the concept of "from one many" is not racist. Please note that our diversity is in our unity. There is no hate in unity. Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are
based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of
the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the
system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of
color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy,

surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified.

The above definition is extremely prejudicial. Capitalism is not a political system. It is simply economic. Please replace the entire above definition with the one below.

Capitalism is an economic system based on the private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decisionmaking and investments are determined by every owner of wealth, property or production ability in financial and capital markets, whereas prices and the distribution of goods and services are mainly determined by competition in goods and services markets.

At least replace the definition in the glossary with the following:

Capitalism- an economic system in which industry, labor and trade are based on a free market.

Note that in a capitalist system, governmental controls are much less intrusive than in a socialist economic system giving the individual (all individuals) much more freedom to make their own economic decisions. Also note that the editorial comments of the writers are not included regarding the criticisms of capitalism in this definition .

Social justice- The equitable distribution of resources (rights, money, food, housing, education, etc.) to every individual regardless of ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation, religion, language, or nationality.

Sounds like Utopia. Where do I sign up!

Last time I checked Utopia does not exist. I suppose the closest to this system is communism. But since there is no incentive to improve or invest, there is stagnation and misery...or wait for it ... Utopia. It should be noted that USSR failed.

Social Justice is not a viable concept. Justice is viable. Delete the idea of social justice and its definition from your curriculum.

In Fact - Rewrite this curriculum!
