I don't see any entries for `Jewish' as a cultural/ethnic group There is an entry for the BDS movement which is racist against Jews and Israel. There is no balance to include any entry about Israel. There is an entry for `Islamophobia' but no balance for `anti-semitism' p. 235 Several people listed here are quite anti-semitic and should be identified, such as Linda Sarsour, Rashida Tlaib, and Ilhan Omar Also, there is no teaching of many other ethnicities such as Chinese, Japanese, or Korean immigrants Also, there is no teaching of the Jewish Holocaust, which should be taught to balance the Arab and Muslim narrative
