Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I support the proposed model Ethnic Studies curriculum for California, including the modules on Arab American history.
Ethnic Studies was created through the struggle of communities of color to make sure their rich history and perspectives are included in public education. Students and educators across the country have made it clear that Ethnic Studies is a critical component of education for the 21st century.
I believe that it is essential that a module on Arab-Americans be included in the Ethnic Studies curriculum.The Arab-Americanexperience, including the impact of Islamophobia, is rarely taught in schools, even in many schools with Ethnic Studies programs. That absence results in Arab-American students feeling both invisible and targeted.
During the period of public comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum a wide range of Israelaligned, Zionist organizations have publically attacked the curriculum for being antisemitic and antiIsrael. As usual,they claim to speak for the entire Jewish community when they do not. I am Jewish.
While I believe that it is very important to teach about antisemitism and about Jewish American history, this content is already present in the California standards.The model Ethnic Studies curriculum includes mention of antisemitism as as a distinct form of social oppression related to others such as racism, sexism and anti-Arabism.
The purpose of the model Ethnic Studies curriculum is to center the history of people of color who have been marginalized or ignored by the current curriculum. Curriculum about Arab-Americans is not antisemitic.Arabs have been coming to the United States since before it was formed as nation.
Racism, Islamophobia and antisemitism are on the rise today in the United States. At JVP we recognize that our common enemy is white supremacy andour safety as communities will come through solidarity with each other and with all communities demonized by white supremacy.
