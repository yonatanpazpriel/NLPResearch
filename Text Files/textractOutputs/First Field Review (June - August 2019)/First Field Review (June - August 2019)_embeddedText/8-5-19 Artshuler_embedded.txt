Glossary and Bibliography

On Page 2 of the glossary for the curriculum, there is a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions ("BDS") campaign against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." Please understand, this is a politicized form of anti-semitism
The BDS focuses only on Israel, the only Jewish state in the World.. Why only Israel? Why not be fair and discuss the human rights abusers from countries in the Middle East sucs as Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Afghanistan, and more. What about China? It does not target the 10 states where being gay currently subjects one to the death penalty. Do our young students know there are still slaves in countries like Qatar and Mauritania. The Ethnic Model 2020 Curriculum does not target the numerous states where women have no rights and are treated like property, such as Pakistan, Congo and Saudi Arabia. It doesn't target states where there are no rights for gays and lesbians.
Please understand, the purpose of the BDS campaign is not to "establish freedom" for anyone. Let's be fair. Why not target Arab states were freedom of speech, religion and censorship is part of the political culture. Israel is the only democratic country in the Middle East.
The proposed definition for the antisemitic BDS campaign is also misleading because its purpose is not freedom, but destruction of Israel. Its founders and main proponents have never hid that their purpose with BDS is to de-legitimize the State of Israel in its entirety. BDS does not attack a specific Israeli policy. It attacks Israel's existence. BDS representatives regularly say this, they do not hide it. BDS leaders/founders believe that there should be no Jewish state anywhere.

Lesson Plans Earl Altshuler

On pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:
Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but provides for no voices critical of their (antisemitic and ahistorical) perspectives (p. 234).
Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists (who are encouraged and incited to want to murder Jews by both the PA and Hamas) from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237) when there has never, ever, been an independent Arab state west of the Jordan River.
Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242) and completely ignores that the Palestinian Arabs' leaders not only rejected the 1937 and 1947 partition plans, which would have created the first ever independent Arab state west of the Jordan River; but also joined 5 other Arab countries in a self-described genocidal war to destroy Israel and "push the Jews into the Sea."
Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of the incredibly corrupt and dictatorial Palestinian Arab leaders be they within Fatah or Hamas (p. 256, 264-269).
This is a one-sided fraudulent perspective being packaged and sold by the antisemitic BDS campaign in order to indoctrinate a generation with no sense of perspective for the realities on the ground in the MENA, or for any of the history of the antisemitism and violence that targeted Jews in the Levant for mass murder well before the creation of the state of Israel.
This proposed curriculum wholly and highly inaccurately ignores the virulent and violent antisemitism has prevented peace for over 100 years and has placed Israeli society under

war-like conditions since before the Jewish people succeeded in gaining independence in their indigenous homeland from the British and Ottoman Empires, which controlled the Levant for nearly 450 years before Israel declared its independence. This curriculum ignores that history and is therefore entirely misleading and not remotely educational. It is antisemitic propaganda. Nothing more.
This proposed curriculum ignores all of this history and reality. Teachers should be placed in a position to educate accurately and present the complexity of the situation in the MENA. These proposed lesson plans and materials do not set them up for success � unless the goal here is not to educate, but to propagandize and spread antisemitic and ahistorical hate.

Introduction Earl Altshuler
Concerned California Resident

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."
I hope you will consider adding lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled pogroms and persecution in Europe, fled the Holocaust, survived the Holocaust, fled from persecution and oppression in the MENA, as well as discrimination in the former Soviet Union. I hope you will also consider adding lessons about antisemitism in America, how it manifests itself today, not only as hatred for Jews individually, but as a collective, particularly when they "dare" to establish their sovereignty in their indigenous homeland.
All I ask is that you be fair. The BDS is fraudulently blinding the eyes of too many people around the World. We must see the BDS for what it is and students deserve to hear quotes from it's leaders about Jews and Israel. Students deserve to understand how women, gays, lesbians and even alcoholics are treated in Arab countries. They deserve to understand how woman were not permitted an education in the past.
If you feel Israel needs changes then please call out other countries in the Middle East for what they need to do to make changes as well. Please do not create more anti-semitism among our young people. You will be contributing to the same hate of the Jewish people that created a scapegoat for Hitler during WWII.
