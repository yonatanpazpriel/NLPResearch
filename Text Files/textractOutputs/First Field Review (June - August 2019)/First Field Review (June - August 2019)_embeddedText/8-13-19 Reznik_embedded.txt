Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This curriculum is extremely disturbing and highly objectionable in the way it fails to recognize a variety of issues related to American Jewry. The curriculum not only excludes the American Jewish experience, but it also fails to discuss anti-Semitism, which, sadly is on the rise in America today. It also highlights the BDS movement which is also known by objective sources to be a thinly veiled antiSemitic movement masquerading as a legitimate social political movement. This curriculum is disappointing in all of the foregoing ways and must be modified consistent with the foregoing comments to be a balanced curriculum. Surely, this curriculum was intended to enhance sensitivity towards all ethnic groups in America and to foster greater understanding amongst Americans. It is rather shocking that a document which was intended to enhance sensitivity actually fosters ill-will. This curriculum is offensive This comment refers specifically to the Glossary as well as to pages 234, 237, 242, 256 and pages 264-269 found in the sample course models. I am confident that once more attention, thought and objectivity is applied to these pages that the California Department of Education will modify accordingly.
