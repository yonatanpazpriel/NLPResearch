The Ethnic Studies Curriculum is appallingly biased and should NEVER be a graduation requirement.
Capitalism cannot be equated with racism. It is not a "form of power and oppression". Capitalism is the most successful economic system in the world. It is the reason for America's prosperity and the reason why people all over the world want to immigrate to the USA.
I ask the board to NOT approve the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
