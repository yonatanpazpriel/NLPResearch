� I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
� Including a history of migration to the US (page 236) is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate a rich history of a growing population.
