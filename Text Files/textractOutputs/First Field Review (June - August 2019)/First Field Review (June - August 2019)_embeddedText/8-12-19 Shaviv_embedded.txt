From: Paula and Roey Shaviv Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 10:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comments about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I find it antisemitic
To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my concern over the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I find it antisemitic. In it I find passages like "Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions".
BDS is a racist, antisemitic movement whose goal is ethnic cleansing of Jews form what is now the State of Israel, and in so doing, eliminate the State of Israel from the face of Earth.
In the glossary of Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum there is no mention of Antisemitism, the Holocaust or of Jews as an ethnic group. This must be fixed.
The Jewish People have been victims of racism for over 2,000 years. Racism against Jews even has its own term "Antisemitism". Indeed, if here is one thing the extreme right and the extreme left agree upon it is Antisemitism. They both support it and we must oppose it.
We now see a new era of Antisemitism. And it now finds its ugly way into the school curriculum. We cannot let this happen.
Thank you Roey Shaviv Ph.D.
