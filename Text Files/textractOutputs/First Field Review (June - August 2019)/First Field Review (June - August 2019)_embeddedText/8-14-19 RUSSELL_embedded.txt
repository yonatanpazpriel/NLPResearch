I've heard something very disturbing concerning a new ethnic studies curriculum that has an agenda. It promotes antisematizm, that capitalism is racist, portrays Jews as conspirators and that Israel doesn't have a right to exist! Also glorifies a cop killer named Ashad who then escaped the US to communist Cuba to escape prosecution, and that Iran is a victim of the United States! I urge you not to allow an agenda by these authors and present facts and allow young students to form their own opinions! This curriculum sounds more like propaganda than educational material! Let me know what your planning to do about this for I have a student in the public school system.thank you for you consideration- Colleen Russell
