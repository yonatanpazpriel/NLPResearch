Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced on page 1, Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. This means there is an impactful gap in exposure to different ethnic groups and cultures for California students.
