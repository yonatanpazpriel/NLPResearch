It's shameful the CA would even consider this ANTISEMTIC ethnic studies program. It's sounds like the beginning of the WWII Nazi era targeting the Jewish people. Cancel this programnow before you indoctrinate, with irreputable damage, the young minds In CA with your blatant Antisemtic views. Shame on your organization & curriculum targeting the Jewish People!
