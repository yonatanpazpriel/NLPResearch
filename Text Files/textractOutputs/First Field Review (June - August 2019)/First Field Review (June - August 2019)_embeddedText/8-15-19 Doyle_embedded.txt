From: D V Doyle Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Subject: MAJOR REVISIONS NEEDED FOR ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am upset by the proposed ESMC. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I urge you to make major revisions or a serious rewrite of the curriculum consistent with recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand with us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
ESMC focuses heavily on power structures and forms of oppression including white supremacy, sexism, classism, Islamaphobia, transphobia, but excludes any mention of Anti-Semitism. anti-Jewish bias receives only a small passing mention during a discussion of intersectionality in a proposed course on Pacific Islander studies. A 22 -age glossary and bibliography have entries for Islamophobia and Racism, but none for anti-semitism.
I ask you to make major revisions or rewrite the ESMC to address these concerns.
Thank you.
Diana Doyle
