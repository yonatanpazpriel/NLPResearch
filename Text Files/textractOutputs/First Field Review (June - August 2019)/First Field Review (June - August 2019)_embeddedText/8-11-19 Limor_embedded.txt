The new ethnic studies curriculum for high school students next year is not true, biased and discriminatory. As a California resident and a parent of a future high school student, I feel shameful and very concerned of the new curriculum that will be taking effect this coming school year. This curriculum is representing false information and spreading hate. I feel that my kid won't be safe anymore in your schools and that considering such an anti Semitic curriculum is wrong and discriminatory. The content needs to change and if you need help I know many people who will be happy to help with facts and true statements. This is not a high school proper material. This is not appropriate for the United States, the land of freedom. Please help us stop this madness.
