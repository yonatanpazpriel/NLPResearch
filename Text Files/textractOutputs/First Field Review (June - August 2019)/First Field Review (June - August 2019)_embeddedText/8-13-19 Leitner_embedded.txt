From: Marissa Matthew Leitner Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 8:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Kenneth McDonald Subject: Major concerns regarding the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Marissa Leitner, School Psychologist, Licensed Educational Psychologist.
The draft curriculum effectively erases the American Jewish Experience and reflects an anti-Jewish bias that would be dangerous to institutionalize in our curriculum. The draft omits antisemitism and in fact uses a narrative about Jews that echoes the propaganda of the Nazi Regime. Thank you for your consideration in removing this curriculum from being instated. Thank you, Marissa Leitner
