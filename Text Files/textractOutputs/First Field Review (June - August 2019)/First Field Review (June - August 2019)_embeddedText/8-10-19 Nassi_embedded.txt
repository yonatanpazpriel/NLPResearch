Hello,
I am concerned about the proposed ethnic studies curriculum for the state of California. The anti-Jewish themes being reported could lead to increased hatred and bigotry against Jews. These slanted views have the possibility of empowering young people to hate Jews and to hate Israel. I encourage you to offer a more balanced curriculum, one that doesn't effectively demonize another group.
Sincerely,
Shaul Nassi
