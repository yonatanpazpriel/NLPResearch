To Whom It May Concern,
I have just learned the proposed curriculum encourages an anti-Israel, and therefore an anti-Jewish point of view. So, please allow me to make extremely important clarifications, especially because there is nothing more dangerous than incomplete information. Certainly, your information is just as incomplete about millions of other topics in the world, and focusing on another country, instead of the US is not only based on incomplete information and thus dangerous, but it is also non-patriotic, as I will clarify later by a video clip taken from a TV Series. In spite of being one of the most advanced nations in the world, we still have countless problems of our own which we have to focus on solving. Given this fact, pointing fingers at others (especially when our assumptions about them are as incomplete as they are about the Greeks, the Sudanese, or the Chinese) seems so inherently wrong. Anti-Israel sentiments are dangerous lies propagated by the falsely called Palestinians, which to a small degree is addressed in this clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAndoxXUNtI. If by metamorphosis every country could be likened to a person, then every person should FIRST mind their own business. To totally comprehend what I am trying to express, especially about incomplete information, please kindly read the following, AT LEAST TWICE:
In ancient times, Jews used to be citizens of the Kingdom of Israel, which was broken up by illegitimate (and very offensive) actions against them, followed by more occupations led by various aggressive people. Over time, these tragedies caused most of the Jews to be expelled out of their own land. Only a handful remained behind under successive occupations, yet they were never allowed to rule independently. However, regardless of where they were scattered throughout the world, the Jews promised themselves (and their offspring) that someday they would have to rightfully take back their ancestral land. And finally they did, after the collapse of the last aggressive occupying power, namely the Turkish Ottoman Empire, and the successive transition of the land under the administration of the British Empire, as one of the various outcomes of the end of World War II. This enabled the Jews scattered throughout the world (due to the forced expulsion) to travel back to their ancestral land and to reclaim it from the transitional occupying power (namely the British Empire), then claim independence in 1948 and rename it from Palestine (proclaimed by the occupiers) back to Israel. These actions were followed along the establishment of their modern government modeled after American democratic values.
Those who call themselves Palestinians, are the descendants of the occupiers of the land, who are mainly Arabs. They call themselves this, because after occupying the land (and not even taking good care of it), they illegitimately named it Palestine. Now that the land has been legitimately taken back from them, they want an independent state on that land, while in reality THEY are the ones who have been occupying the land (which has been, and is now once again legitimately called Israel). Understandably, the majority of the people who are not Jews (and even some undereducated Jews) have not received enough history lessons and other important facts related to this, as the land is so small and insignificant, were it not for the fact that it has been the motherland of one of the most famous Jews in the world, named Jesus. And, since the majority of those who call themselves Palestinians are anti-establishment (and thus leftists), I presume some left-leaning educators are subconsciously intending to side with the real occupiers and oppressors who call themselves

Palestinians, especially because the lie-generating machines of the so-called Palestinians are very deceptive and truly strong ï¿½ more on this later. They wrongly keep antagonizing Israel, while in some ways Israel is even more democratic than many other democratic nations, as it is run by a multi-party government, even including some of the most leftist parties imaginable in the world (such as this one: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maki_(political_party)!!!). Not only that, but the government of Israel is so democratic that it even allows the descendants of the occupiers (who tend to call themselves Palestinians) to participate in the democratic process, too, so long as they do not reject the government of the country in which they have been born. THIS is the very definition of IRONY!!!!!
How have the corrupt leaders of the so-called Palestinians returned the kindness of the Jews and the government established by them? They have incited conflicts, then they have used the uneducated socalled Palestinians as human shields. Or, most of the times, they have brainwashed the populace under their influence to hate Israel and martyr themselves in by continuing attacks. At other times, they have shown corpses of Arab children (stolen from morgues in hospitals) in front of international media, as proof that Israelis have committed war crimes. This is because Israelis have been allowing the people of Arab nation to live in their own quarters and govern themselves as independently as humanly possible, in order to be able to peacefully coexist with each other. Yet, many times this has backfired, as the corrupt leaders have taken advantage, over and over again. THIS, too, is the very definition of IRONY!!!!!
Thankfully, many fair-minded Arabs understand and fully accept the government of the country in which they've been born, while rejecting the illegitimate actions of the occupying people from whom they have descended. The Jews (who comprise the majority of the government of Israel, but not all of it) recognize the understanding of these fair-minded Arabs, compassionately forgive them for the crimes of their ancestors, and embrace them as patriotic Israelis who they are. To put this into perspective, let us hear it from these Arab gentlemen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REibqO7zJvI, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2NaiX-hvVQ. The latter is a frustrated and angry gentleman who is the son of the anti-Israeli faction of the Arab nation, named HAMAS. (His name is Mosab Hassan Yousef .) The likes of BDS movement and other propaganda are campaigns that are started and funded by the likes of his father, whom he rightfully condemns, as a patriotic Israeli (rather than being an Arab nationalist). When it comes to nation-mindedness versus patriotism, nothing speaks to this truth more than the following clip taken from a popular TV series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTN1ry1E7AQ. The likes of the lessons embedded in this speech are the ones that California Department of Education should be focusing on, instead of antagonizing messages about other countries).
There are many more ironies, all of which are the results of aggressive false campaign against the government of Israel by radical anti-government elements within the land of Israel constantly pushing for conflict, from inside and outside, in order to profit from keeping themselves in corrupt positions of leadership, so that they can profit more and more from conflicts. For example, while in the recent times Israel has repeatedly (and wrongly) been called an apartheid state, by definition apartheid is when a minority takes control of the majority (as in South Africa). Well, the majority of the people in Israel are non-Arab Jews, and so is the government. Therefore, this definition of Apartheid against the Arabs does not stick. Even if the misinformed parties have been trying to refer to racism, the following documentary shows how the righteous white-skinned Jews inside (and even outside) Israel have made serious sacrifices to rescue thousands of black-skinned Jews, almost 30 years ago: https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=operation+solomon. To further corroborate this "operation", as an example here is a lady who immigrated from Ethiopia back to her ancestral homeland

of Israel, then got embraced and empowered, enough to even become one of Israel's beauty queens: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs-s2E1KEVM.
Last, but not the least, lest it gets forgotten to read this message twice, I feel compelled to mention there are many Jews with US-Israel dual citizenship who are lawyers and Judges. Should an anti-Israel or anti-Jewish message from this institution see the light of day, every resource will be used to launch very heavy litigations that can bounce back and hit the responsible parties like thousands of tons of bricks. Indeed, what needs to be made clear is that it is very inappropriate for this educational institution to talk about other countries such as Israel (or even Kazakhstan, for that matter) based on incomplete information due to lack of complete context, while worse yet, we still have multitude of problems of our own to deal with, right here in our own backyard.
Let us be good enough to mind our own business, by putting our focus on righting our own wrongs, wherever they may be found, right here, right now. Unlike Israel, which is a conglomeration of Jews of many ethnicities having come back from various countries in the world (after comingling with various ethnicities), we have yet to learn to fully embrace our own various ethnicities within. We need to find ways to get empowered by the strength of multitude of ethnicities within our own borders. Please let us focus on THAT. For example, as an Iranian-American, I am surprised it is hardly ever mentioned that we are the one ethnicity with the highest contribution to income per capita, as well as the highest rate of contribution to the scientific community in the US. Let us focus on making our own selves great again, by proper education, whoever the POTUS may be.
Thank you for your time and attention!
