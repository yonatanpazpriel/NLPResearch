California's proposed ethnic studies curriculum needs to be substantially revised to reflect the many groups that make up our diverse state.

In particular, this draft fails to cover communities such as American Jews, Armenians, Greeks, Hindus and Koreans.

Surprisingly, it excludes the word "anti-Semitism" from the glossary while appropriately including "Islamophobia." Also, the use of the term "Nakba" to describe the creation of Israel is biased and should be replaced with a neutral term.

It should not be up to communities to request or demand inclusion � as was the case with Pacific Islanders, Central Americans and Arab Americans. It's up to the drafters of this curriculum to reflect the diversity of our state.

In particular, by capturing the sweep of the Arab American experience, and not the Jewish, this curriculum risks fueling prejudice and bigotry rather than alleviating it.
