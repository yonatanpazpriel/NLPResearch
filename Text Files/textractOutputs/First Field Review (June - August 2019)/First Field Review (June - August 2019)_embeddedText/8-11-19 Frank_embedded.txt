From: Hillary Frank Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 11:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Absolutely not the kind of education CA kids need
Anti-Israel, pro BDS curriculum? Absolutely not the quality education we'd expect from CA. It promotes hate at it's core and is not what CA stands for. I am shocked to even see this considered and will 100% pull my kids out of the public schools they're in if this passes.
Please consider the major ramifications broadly if this passes.
Hillary
