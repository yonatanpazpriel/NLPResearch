I just searched 300 pages of one curriculum document Zero references to Judaism, Zero references to Holocaust, Zero references to Hitler, One Reference to the word Jew. One reference to the word Anti-Semitism, There are 84 references to Muslim and 208 references to Arab.

Two references to Capitalism:

1) capitalism/class/classism 2) Some examples of systems of power are: white supremacy, capitalism, and patriarchy.

So we teach the kids that Capitalism is bad, and is a class system? We teach them using teaching of Hamas, Black Panther, Black Lives Matter references but NOTHING about the the Holocaust?

Anti-Semitism and Anti American, Anti-Semitic, Socialist agenda Indoctrination.

This is just an outline of teaching a new generation (K-12) of American Children to hate America. Our country was founded on free market capitalism. Instead of teaches kids that hard work pays off, that ANYONE can succeed, this teaches kids that you are a product of your birth, Everyone is against them no matter how hard they try.

You want to bring up the status of other Ethnicities, but in doing so bring down the kids by teaching about whiteness and white privilege.

Just like we can't bring down Blacks, and Asians and Pacific Islanders and Native Americans, we cant teach that bringing down the white culture is bad either.

This is anti-Semitic, Anti-American, Socialist indoctrination.

More Examples of the ridiculousness of the curriculum.

Here are some of my favorite definitions. Again, this is not the 1950's, or 60;s or 30;s when there was a
foundation of American pride. This is 2019 and we are in deep patriotic trouble.

� Capitalism: Capitalism- an economic and political system in which industry and trade are based on a "free market" and largely controlled by private companies instead of the government. Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified.

� Cisheteropatriarchy- a system of power that is based on the dominance of cisheterosexual men. Anti-Male, in a society that is already pushing toxic masculinity.
