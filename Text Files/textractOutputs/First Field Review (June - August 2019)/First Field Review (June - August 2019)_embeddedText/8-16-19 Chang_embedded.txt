Hello,
I am a school board member of Los Gatos-Saratoga Union High School District. I am also former president and current vice president-northern of Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA). I am submitting these comments as an individual, however, as neither my local board nor APISBMA board has had an opportunity to discuss this draft to come up with a position.
1. In general, I agree with the objectives of Ethnic Studies. But I want to caution that the draft seems to present some controversial political views. Our goals are to educate our students to be more inclusive, understand and appreciate the ethnic diversity and cultures we have in our community, state and nation.
2. My observation of World History curriculum in high school is there is so much emphasis on Europe and not much on Asia (which is emergying and we are doing our students a disservice by not having some basic knowledge of it) and other continents. They also learned so much WWII in Europe history but not as much about what happened in Asia.
3. I also observed for the middle school social studies curriculum, my sons spent an entire week learning about Ellis Island and its significance while not mentioning much about Angel Island and its history and significance. I have a friend whose daughters went to Bullis (in Los Altos School District before it became a charter school), and they had a field trip visiting the site and the experiences were quite meaningful and relevant to our kids in California.
4. The approach and timing of seeking public input about ESMC is not most ideal as people need to gain a better understanding about the contents and also people are away during summer time. Perhaps you can extend the public comments period as well more local hearings to reach out the public.
