The word history is non gendered. Can we please not contribute to continued ignorance of its etymology? The current spelling of a word does not make it gendered.
Why is Western European culture missing? Our multi ethnic students need a fair and unbiased look at the heritage, traditions, and current beliefs of if that culture as well. We may not assume that they know.
