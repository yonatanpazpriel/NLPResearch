Very concerned that Anti �Semitism isn't included (it was only two years ago that the White Nationalist rally in Charlottsville that participants chanted"Jews will not replace us" Tree of Life Synagogue anybody??? How about that FDR wouldn't allow a boat of Jewish refugees enter the US and they were turned back to Europe where they were exterminated? Also Israel/Palestinian conflicts: the Palestinians were actually Jordanians who were not permitted to return to Jordan. They have been used as pawns for decades and my heart goes out to them since their leaders have betrayed them and stolen from them. However, your take is very one-sided. By the way, I'm a liberal democrat, but I think your take on history is very slanted and inaccurate. Thank you
