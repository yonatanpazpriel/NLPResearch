From: Michael Reed Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 9:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent; Tony Thurmond Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply upset by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, StandWithUs, JIMENA, AMCHA and others.
I am a product of California public schools. Unfortunately, I was repeatedly called out for being Jewish, and not in positive ways. Children are harsh towards one another; we need to promote inclusion, tolerance, and acceptance, through our messaging and our educational curriculum. Today, I have two teenage daughters who will be directly affected by the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which, in its current form, supports bullying.
I am a proponent of diversity in all forms. As such, I am opposed to a curriculum that "erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools," as stated in the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter. The proposed model curriculum completely ignores the experiences of American Jews, promotes a boycott of Israel, and ignores antisemitism. How can we do this our next generation? This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Michael Reed
