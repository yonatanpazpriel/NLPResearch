Hello!
I am opposed to the implementation of ethnic studies "guidelines" in our CA schools, especially not at the K to 9th grade levels.
Our students are not reading and writing in basic English sufficiently well nor are they overall competent in basic math. Our focus should be on teaching basic skills and allowing students to learn job related skills suitable for earning their way in life.
Please do not implement the ethnic studies guidelines.
Thank you Cathy Viney
