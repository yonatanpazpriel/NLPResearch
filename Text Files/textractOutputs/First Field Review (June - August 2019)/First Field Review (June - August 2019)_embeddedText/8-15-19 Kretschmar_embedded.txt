From: Laura Kretschmar Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:56 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Please approve ethnic studies curriculum
To Whom it May Concern--
Please do the right thing and continue the inclusion of Arab Americans in the Ethnic Studies curriculum.
As a teacher of increasingly more and more Arab American students, it is so important to have Ethnic Studies and their culture represented. As a child, after the Vietnam and Cambodian Wars, I wish we had had ethnic studies to help us understand and be more inclusive to the students and families that came into our communities.
Thank you, Laura Kretschmar
