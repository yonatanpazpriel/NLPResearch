Thank you to the IQC for working to create a guideline to an Ethnic Studies curriculum for our secondary public-school students. Studying Asian American, Native American, Latin American, and African American cultures will add to the richness of our student's educational journey. I noticed, however, that many ethnicities that have played important roles in the history of our state have been excluded. While it is impossible to include every ethnicity, included was a section on Arab Americans and the Ottoman Empire. By including these topics and excluding related ethnicities, specifically, the Armenians, and Armenian Genocide, then the curriculum now seems biased and imbalanced. I trust this was not an intentional oversight. Armenian's have played in important role in contributing to our California society. There are many significant Armenian American's, including poets, inventors, philanthropists, musicians and actors, and California even has even had an Armenian American governor. There are more than 3 million Armenian Americans living in California, some that have been here for many generations, that have helped contribute to California's diversity. To exclude them is a disservice to our student. Please consider adding Armenian American's to chapter 2 of the California Ethnic Studies curriculum. Thank you.
