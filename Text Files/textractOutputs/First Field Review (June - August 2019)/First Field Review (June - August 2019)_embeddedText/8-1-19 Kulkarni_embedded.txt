Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
[Page 19, Line 461-462] Crenshaw's work did not account for ability and dis/ability as part of the intersectional framework originally. It was later added by critical scholars of dis/ability as an identity (Erevelles and Minear, 2010)
General Comment: I would like to see a better integration of dis/ability as an identity and xsectional identity marker throughout the overview.
