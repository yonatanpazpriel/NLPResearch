Dear California Department of Education,
Below is my input into 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum:
I strongly urge you to create curriculum to combat, rather than promote anti-Semitism as your model curriculum does at this point.
My mother-in-law survived, though no-else in her family did. She will be 90 in November and is not only appalled, but frightened. She was born in Nazi Germany.
Please do the right thing. Don't encourage any more hate against the Jews. Children need to know what happened so it never happens again. It's time for Open Season on Jews to end.
Regards,
