Dear Sirs and Madams; I live in Irvine, CA for more than 20 years. I am so concerned about this curriculum especially as it related to Jews in California. I see one-sided criticism of Israel, along with the exclusion of any discussion of the contributions of Jewish Californians to the state and any discussion of anti-Semitism. The bibliography omits AntiSemitism but includes: Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African anti-apartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law. BDS proponents and organizers have called for the global community to boycott or withdraw support from Israel and companies associated with it. The second component of BDS calls for governments, banks, universities, and other institutions to withdraw monetary support (divestment) from Israel and its companies. And finally, the third component-- sanctions--asks international governments to hold Israel accountable for its actions through legislation, trade and military agreements, among other measures.
I invite you all to go on a visit to Israel and see personally what a lie this is. If truth and real education of our kids matter to you, then you will change the curriculum and be honest and void of political agenda or influenced by Palestinian and Arab lobby.
Thank you! Uzi Yair| Newport Beach, CA
