Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am disappointed by the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews and supports the antisemitic BDS movement.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Theda and Oscar Firschein
