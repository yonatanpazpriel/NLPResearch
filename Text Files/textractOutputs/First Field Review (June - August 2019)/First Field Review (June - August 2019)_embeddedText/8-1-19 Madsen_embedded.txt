Bad idea. The major of the curriculum is highly subjective. I do not see my ethnic group as a subject. I am Nordic. Why is my culture not part of those studies. From the year 800 to about 1100 ad, my culture ruled 3/4 of the known world. Does that not deserve study. If I am not included in your curriculum I will have to bring a law suit against the schools and Sacramento. Really don't want to do that but we must do what is fair and right for our kids. California's educational system is already one of the worst in the nation. Are you "trying to make it worse "? Look to improve it, not do something that makes a few guilty feeling liberals trying to be PC feel better about themselves. This curriculum will only cause division.
