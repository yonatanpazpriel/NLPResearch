To Whom It May Concern:
RE: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Attached please find our completed public input template on the abovereferenced matter.
The draft curriculum fails to meet the goals of the ESMC authorizing statute, AB2016, specifically, to "prepare pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."
The proposed curriculum fails for its hostility to both the American Jewish experience as well as to the presentation of the state of Israel.
1.The draft excludes Jews and their American history.
2. It neglects anti-Semitism by definition or discussion. Anti-Semitism, hatred of Jews, leads to hate crimes and incidents against all minority religious groups in California (in our schools and communities) as well as across the nation.
3. The proposed curriculum includes rote anti-Semitic tropes and antiJewish stereotypes.
4. The policies of the State of Israel are irrelevant to the study of ethnicities in America. The depiction of Israel is inflammatory and propagandistic.
This is no way to teach ethnic studies to our students. Remember, our students will hold our future in their hands. Teach them well.
As AB 2016 sets out: "the state's educational standards should be guided by core values of equity, inclusiveness and universally high expectations." We urge you to meet this standard by including Jewish culture and history, teaching about anti-Semitism, and avoiding irrelevant and inflammatory polemics related to Israel.
You can do better. You must do better for our students and our future.

The glossary omits the definition of Anti-Semitism which is hatred of Jews. Jews are the most frequently targeted religious group when hate crimes are committed. This is true in California and nationally as well. You can do better. The glossary includes an incomplete and inaccurate definition of BDS. I question why it is included at all. BDS is an Anti-Semitic movement cloaked as criticism of Israel. At its core is the total destruction of the State of Israel and the elimination of the Jewish people from their historic homeland.

P234 Line 4956 Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter
Line 4957 Call to Boycott Divest and Sanction Israel
The campaign to delegitimize Israel is being waged across the globe: The Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS), which rejects Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, is the most prominent effort to undermine Israel's existence. The BDS campaign is rampant with misinformation and distortion. ADL.org has developed an in-depth analysis to expose the illegitimacy of the BDS movement. You should read it. You can do better for the students of California.

Line 4958 Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico At its core this is a ridiculous comparison. It is also nonsense to compare a peaceful boarder between legitimate nations and the security wall erected by Israel to protect its citizens (Muslims, Christians and Jews and others) from the people who seek the destruction of Israel and the elimination of the Jewish people.

Arab American Studies Outline P268-269 It is an Anti-Semitic trope that Jews control the media. This is a baseless, offensive claim to accuse Israel of colonizing land. Read the short recent history of Israel. The state is only 71 years old and has never had a whole year of peace. It is in a hostile neighborhood. Yet it has developed advances in technology, medicine, science, water resources and other accomplishments from which we all benefit in the state of California. You can do better for the students of California.
