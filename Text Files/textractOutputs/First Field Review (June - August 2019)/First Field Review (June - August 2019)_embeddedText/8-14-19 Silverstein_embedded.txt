Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am upset by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. To me this is a very important time, because of our grand-children, who hear anti-Semitism in their high schools and colleges, in the news on T.V. and the radio, as well as the Muslims that became members of the House of Representatives, all in the mid-west of the country, and somehow became members of Nancy Pelosi's, and these Muslim women in the House of Representatives went after Pelosi's very strong committee and ended up qas part of this very strong committee, and their first move was to try and eliminate Israel our strongest ally in the middle east, and the only country to have the United States back, in this war torn area of the world, and the Prime Minister of Israel, wanted congress to impeach these women, and get rid of Pelosi as well, and, the House killed the Muslims bill and put Pelosi in a very bad position with both the Democrats and Republicans, but know impeachments yet for the four Muslims in the house, as well as nothing done to Nancy Pelosi, other than a slap on her wrists.I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Thank you, Gordon Silverstein, President Triad Insurance Group
