California Department of Education:
I am writing in complete disgust over your decision to scrap the model ethnic studies curriculum that was developed by the leading experts in the field in order to wash it down into something that is "palatable" to racist white supremacists. THIS IS AN OUTRAGE!!!!
The model curriculum that has been developed was done so using the best practices and award winning pedagogies that have been proven to improve student success! Any attempts to water down the curriculum because it is offensive to white supremacists is a complete failure to recognize why these programs have been successful- because they tell the truth that students can relate to! I strongly urge you to adopt the curriculum that these brave and bold educators have developed, anything less will be a disgrace!
