From: Ellen Friedman Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 7:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is Not inclusive
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am deeply troubled by the flawed/unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum being proposed. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, only if you are willing to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
Unless the Jewish population, a group who has supported so many in the community and world, is not included, it is better to not have an Ethnic Studies Curriculum as it will only divide and be meaningless.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Otherwise it is better left undone.
Thank you, Ellen Friedman
