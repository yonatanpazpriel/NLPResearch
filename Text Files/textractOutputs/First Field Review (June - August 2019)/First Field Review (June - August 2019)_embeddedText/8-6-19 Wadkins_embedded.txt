From: Bryan Wadkins Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 8:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum: Don't indoctrinate our youth
This course of study allows for little critical thinking and seems to be a lesson on politically correct group think. Although the understanding of our diverse state is important, all academic study should present information and that challenges students to examine both sides of issues and come up with their own perspective.
It is subject matter like this and numerous others that are the reason that many people are pulling their children from public schools. Unfortunately, some families are not able to do that financially and are forced to allow their children to be subjected to subject matter that they disagree with. Please focus on teaching our children the history of these groups not opinions.
