From: Lee Rosenblum Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Objections to Model Curriculum
August 11, 2019
Ms. Soomin Chao Chair Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N. Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901
Dear Ms. Chao,
I am a life-long resident of the State of California and a complete product of the public school system and the University of California, as were my two children. I am writing to express my grave concern about the proposed current draft of the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. It is misleading and inaccurate in several critical respects.
Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, culture, business and politics-- as well as our longstanding struggle against bigotry and hatred--the model curriculum dismisses the American Jewish experience (pp. 48, 200, 233-4, 236).
The draft singles out Israel for approbation (Chapter 2, P. 105). It recommends song lyrics It omits anti-Israel themes. Ignores the blatant and dangerous anti-Semitic tendencies of today's racists (Chapter 2, p. 270).
Please consider this letter in your deliberations. Thank you.

Sincerely, Lee Rosenblum
