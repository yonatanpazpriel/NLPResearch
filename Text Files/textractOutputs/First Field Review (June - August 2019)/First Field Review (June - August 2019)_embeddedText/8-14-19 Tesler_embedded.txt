From: Nancy Tesler Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 3:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: AB 331
Dear Chairperson Chao:
Along with my husband, former mayor and longtime councilman of Davis, Gerald Adler, I am appalled and alarmed at the possible passage of AB 331. Is California still part of the United States of America where anti-Semitism, or for that matter, bias of any sort, is not tolerated much less taught in our public schools? Apparently there are people on your committee who do not adhere to these uniquely American values and are pushing an agenda full of misinformation and hate. No one of that prejudicial mind-set should have anything to do with establishing an educational curriculum, much less one that is mandatory, for our children and should be immediately removed from the committee. I have a grandson who attends a San Francisco high school and it is unacceptable to me that he or any American child be indoctrinated in this manner. School is for opening minds and for teaching critical thinking, not for the brainwashing of its students by political thought police.
Very truly yours,
Nancy Tesler Davis, California
