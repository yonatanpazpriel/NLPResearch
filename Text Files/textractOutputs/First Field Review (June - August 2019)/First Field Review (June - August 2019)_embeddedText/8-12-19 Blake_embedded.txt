From: Melanie Blake Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 3:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Feedback on model curriculum for Ethnic Studies in California
Hello. My name is Melanie Blake and I have actively supported California public schools as a student, parent, teacher, administrator and school board member for over 35 years. I have helped to write curriculum and participated on review boards. I worked for a year with the California Global Education Project (North Bay at Sonoma State University) and supported teachers who wrote and introduced an ethnic studies course for high schools to Santa Rosa City Schools and Sebastopol. I share my background so you know my frame of reference as I make the following comments:
 I am appalled at the level of opinion embedded in what should be "objective" curriculum content.
 Students need to be given facts, history, and a variety of perspectives from which they research, debate, evaluate, and form their own opinions/positions
 The draft as currently presented is not balanced and does not hold to standards demanded by our California Common Core Standards for critical thinking, etc.
I hope future drafts correct bias.
Sincerely, Melanie Blake
-All the best, Melanie
