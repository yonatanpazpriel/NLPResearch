Capitalism must continue to be part of the k-12 curriculum in California schools. The United States is founded on its principles . Every person is free to choose his/her religion, career path, and voice opinions. Capitalism is the most workable and beneficial system. Every person has the freedom and opportunity to succeed and prosper economically. A capitalist economy has statistically pulled more people out of poverty. Socialism and communism benefit solely those in control and take all freedoms and opportunities away from the individual. History has proven that these ideologies have miserably failed their societies; look at the former Soviet Union and the present Venezuela. Why do you think so many want to come to the United States? So they may pursue the American Dream.
Focusing on and high lighting socialism and communism in the school curriculum is brain washing our children into believing that these systems are more beneficial than capitalism which is not only detrimental, but could not be further from the truth. We must do all that we can to instill the value of capitalism in our children so that they may cherish its principles and forever prosper.
