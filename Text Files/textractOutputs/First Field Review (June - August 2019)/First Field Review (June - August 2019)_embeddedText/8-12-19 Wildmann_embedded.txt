Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am seriously concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but strongly urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a teacher, I support diversity and inclusion. But, as a child of the Holocaust, I vehemently oppose a curriculum that fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools.
Additionally, the one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish students may be stereotyped, accused of dual-loyalty, harassed and forced to face social litmus tests.
I request you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Viviane Wildmann
