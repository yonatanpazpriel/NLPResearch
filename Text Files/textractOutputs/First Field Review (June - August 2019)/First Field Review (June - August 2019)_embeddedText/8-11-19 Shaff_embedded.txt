Pages 49-50: I suggest adding the names of African Americans who clearly attained success, Benjamin O. Davis, Colin Powell, Jackie Robinson, Clarence Thomas, Thurgood Marshall. There are ample resources on them. The suggested list is heavy on people who resorted to violence to rebel. The alternative of achievement within the system should be emphasized. Pages 61-68: This unit is inflammatory and one-sided. To the extent that there are actual incidents of proven police misconduct, was the subject police officer disciplined? There is no way to tell from this unit.

"This caused a period of time called the Killing Fields in which 10% of the population was killed." Really?
How about a simple declaratory sentence. Pol Pol was a terrible communist despot who ordered the slaughter of over 1,000,000 innocent people, over 10% of the Cambodian population. Don't blame the US for Pol Pot's genocide. That was all on the Khmer Rouge.
