How in the world could you put this example up as a guideline structure for teaching. You are presenting a slanted one sided view as an example to teach children. This is the type of teaching method that was used in the 50's and early 60's in this country. There is no objectivity. Your slanted presentation hides a lot of facts that opposes your point of view. You're going to be bringing up future generations with latent dislike for Israel and the Jews. Has that occurred to you? Your Study Model Curriculum seems more like mass indoctrination used by the Nazi in the mid-30's. You could have easily used hypothetical situations that would have been more appropriate and not establish a bias toward the Jew. I am against this curriculum being used as a standard for teaching as it stands. David Perez
