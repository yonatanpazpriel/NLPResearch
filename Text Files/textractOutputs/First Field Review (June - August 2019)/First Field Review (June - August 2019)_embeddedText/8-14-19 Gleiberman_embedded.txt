I urge the people drafting the proposed ESMC curriculum to work with knowledgeable members of the Jewish community to properly include a discussion of Jewish-American culture in the ESMC curriculum and to delete from that curriculum any language that is perceived by many as anti-Semitic or anti-Israel. A good place to start would be to work with an organization such as the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on the next draft of the ESMC curriculum. The ADL is committed to fighting hate and fostering better understanding among disparate groups. Not changing the proposed ESMC to delete from that curriculum any language that is perceived by many as anti-Semitic or anti-Israel, and to properly include a discussion of the Jewish-American culture, would result in Jewish students feeling threatened and may be perceived as giving permission to others to attack the Jewish community. That result would be the exact opposite of what was intended by the California legislature in adopting AB 2016.
