Line #87 I regretted seeing capitalism listed along with white supremacy and patriarchy. Do we not support capitalism in our democracy anymore? Did not Andrew Carnegie establish our wonderful public libraries? Curriculum feels so angry and oriented to a particular point of view. For balance, also mention gains made by marginalized groups in our country.
