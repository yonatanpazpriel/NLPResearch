The California Department of Education has proposed a controversial anti-Semitic new public high school Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The Curriculum is anti-Israel in that it promotes BDS as a "freedom" movement, legitimizes the description of Israel as an "apartheid" state, and glorifies rabid anti-Israel public figures such as Linda Sarsour. The Ethnics Studies Curriculum also neglects to include Jews as an ethnic minority.
