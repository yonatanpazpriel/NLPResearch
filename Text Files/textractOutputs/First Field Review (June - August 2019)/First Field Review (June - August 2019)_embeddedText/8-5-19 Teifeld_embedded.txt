Sir/Madam How dare you include the BDS, a hateful, anti-Semitic and anti-Israel group in your curriculum for this ethnic studies. As the house and the senate just passed an anti BDS bill you have the nerve to insult and promote anti-Semitism in our schools? DELETE THE BDS FROM THE CURRICULUM IMMEDIATELY AND THEN RESIGN! YOU HAVE NO PURPOSE OR REASON TO BE IN THE POSITION YOU ARE IN!
