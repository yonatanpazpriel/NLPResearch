Dear CA State Board of Education, Thank you for allowing the public to weigh-in on the Ethnic Studies Curriculum and thank you for indicating that it will be substantially revised. I am gratified that the Jewish Caucus of our state legislature has highlighted glaring anti-semantic aspects in the curriculum. However, I'm concerned that other negative aspects may not have been fully addressed. Ethnic studies should include all ethnicities, including those of our founding fathers and mothers. and should not bully people by imposing new words on us such "herstory", "hxstory", "misogynoir" or "cisheteropatriachy" . Also, anti-American propaganda such as the denigration of capitalism has no place in ethnic studies. We should remember who is funding our salaries and our educational system. Encouraging a feeling of victimhood and disrespect will not make us wiser, healthier, more prosperous, more successful or more logical. It is true that some groups have suffered discrimination but this should be presented in a balanced way. In another vein, please know that one very small group of relatively recent legal residents have not been addressed in the curriculum, namely the Zoroastrians in California---whose origins in ancient Persia may go back as far as around 7,000 B.C. It is interesting to note that around 500 BC KIng Cyrus of Persia built a temple for the Jewish people and that about 1300 years

ago the Islamic invasion of Persia resulted in extreme persecution of Zoroastrians who today number only about 120,000. Thank you for your consideration and God bless. Respectfully, Dhun May, veteran California public school teacher
