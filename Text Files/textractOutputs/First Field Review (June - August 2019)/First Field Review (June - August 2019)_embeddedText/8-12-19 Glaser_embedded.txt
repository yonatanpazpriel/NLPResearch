https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-09/ethnic-studies-curriculum-california-antisemitism?_amp=true
I am active in taking a stand against the ethnic studies curriculum proposed by the California Department of Education. As a California licensed psychologist, I am worried and saddened by the proposal and its consequences for the future of Jews in this state and for the nation of Israel. Please change the content of stop this hateful legislation.
