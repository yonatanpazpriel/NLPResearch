Dear Kenneth, I am writing you as as an Israeli and American citizen . I am so sad to find those false accusations against Israel in the form of BDS presented to high school students. I wish you knew the real facts, I wish the news would objectively present the situation. The truth is , that Israel is the only country In the Middle East that gives Arabs so many rights especially woman . Teaching that disinformation will lead to more antisemitism and hate. I invite you to Israel to see how Arabs live freely and are promoted and educated in my country.
Warm regards Dr. Ben-Israel , Michal
