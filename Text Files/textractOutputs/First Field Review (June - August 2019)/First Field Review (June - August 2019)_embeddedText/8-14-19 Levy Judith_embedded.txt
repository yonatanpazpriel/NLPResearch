From: otnj Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
August 13, 2019 Sirs/Madams,
I am most concerned about the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for the following reasons:
1. Anti-Semitism has been excluded from the list of hate crimes even though the majority of hate crimes are against the Jews.
2. The list of ethnic groups excludes Jews.
3. The BDS movement is included in the curriculum without offering a balanced perspective.
4. Music programs include a song which negatively suggest that Jews control the media.
The purpose of our educational system to to teach, to encourage thoughtful discussion and knowledge of differing viewpoints. It should not have a divisive agenda that will negatively impact future interrelationships.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.
