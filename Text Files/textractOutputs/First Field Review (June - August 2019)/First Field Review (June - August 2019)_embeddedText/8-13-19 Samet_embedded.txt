I'm at shock by the proposed Sample courses lack of education regarding Jewish people in America, and the misrepresentation of Israel and Jewish in the proposed curriculum. Israel and Jewish are only discussed and analyzed in the context of the IsraeliPalestine conflict. It is similar to teaching about the U.S by looking on the Vietnam war. There is so much more to the Jewish people tradition and heritage in the U.S.A. However, it is totally over looked. What about adding course to the curriculum regarding Jewish contribution to the U.S and educate how to identify racism and ante schematic and stand against them. With anti-semitic incidents on the rise I would believe that will be an important issue in a liberal country like California. As a family, we already had few anti-semitic incident at school, and I would think that will be a golden opportunity to address that. As a parent to a student who will attend a public high school I'm truly worried by the hate and anti-Semitic narrative in the proposed courses regarding "Call for Boycott, divest, and sancation Israel".

is no other course in your curriculum that is calling to boycott a country and I have to wonder, why is Israel being singled out? The other course suggested on the Palestine conflict are no better, comparing the Palestinian movement to Black life matter is just insulting. My aunt was executed by a Palestinian terrorist. Are you seriously compering terror actions to "Black Life Matter", or you totally ignoring the terror actions?. There is no justification for such courses in your agenda. I call to remove all course regarding the Israeli-Palestine conflict from the curriculum until a sincere study is made, including Israeli and Jewish organizations, reviewing the material presented. To concluded, I'm horrified by the though that my daughter will be expose to anti-semitic content as part of the public school system and I call upon you to ensure that no such thing is done, and to bring a balance picture, that will also celebrate the contribution of the Jewish people to the US.
