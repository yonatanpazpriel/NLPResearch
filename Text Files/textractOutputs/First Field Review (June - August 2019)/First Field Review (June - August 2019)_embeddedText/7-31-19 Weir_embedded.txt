From: Jack Weir Sent: Wednesday, July 31, 2019 8:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Curriculum
I am adamantly opposed to this initiative for the following reasons: > It will further distract from the essential focus we need in public education today - solid academic subjects. Our graduates already suffer in comparison to students from other advanced countries, and other US states. > Since the proposal is merely advisory, it serves more as a propaganda tool for the DEI movement than a serious attempt to bolster academic achievement. > As is the case with the controversial sex education program, this will only increase parental movement toward home schooling and private educational services, reducing funding for public institutions.
