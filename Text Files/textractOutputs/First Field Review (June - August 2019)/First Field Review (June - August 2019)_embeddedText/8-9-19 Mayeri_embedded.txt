From: Paula Mayeri Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Objection to the ethnic studies draft
This draft defeats the purpose of the program. It is to respect all ethnicities and learn about them. The pro bds encouragement, the singleling out Israel for criticism does not do justice to the purpose of the curriculum and just encourages antisemitism.
