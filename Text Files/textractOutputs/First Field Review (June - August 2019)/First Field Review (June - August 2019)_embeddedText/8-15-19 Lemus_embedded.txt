I'm strongly opposed to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As the curriculum stands, it will teach dangerous unfounded opinions as facts at our California schools. As an immigrant from Mexico, I find it astounding that the curriculum plans to teach that capitalism is a "system of power" comparable to white supremacy and patriarchy. On the contrary, capitalism has allowed many Hispanics and minorities to obtain financial independence, create jobs within their local community, and be able to support their own families. Millions of immigrants seek opportunities in the U.S. because it's the land where they can be self-made through a capitalist economic system.

Hispanics and minorities to obtain financial independence, create jobs within their local community, and be able to support their own families. Millions of immigrants seek opportunities in the U.S. because it's the land where they can be self-made through a capitalist economic system. Instead of teaching that capitalism is an oppressive "system of power", the CA Department of Education should be teaching the facts about every economic system and have the students make up their own minds of what they believe is the best for our society. This will allow them to think critically, develop their analytical skills, and consider various view points different than their own. In addition, "elevating" women's rights issues such as reproductive health issues will greatly harm our children by teaching them that abortion is right that empowers women. This will teach young girls that killing their own children is perfectly acceptable. Abortion kills millions of women every year, not just in the U.S., but throughout the world. If the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum champions justice, they should instead be teaching how abortion harms women by killing them prior to their birth. Many immigrants and Hispanics favor capitalism in our state. If this curriculum goes into effect, it will create a more distrust in the Hispanic community toward government of the State of California.
