Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very upset by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I think it is great to teach an ethnic studies class, but compel you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
My mother is a holocaust survivor. I was never able to meet my grandparents and seven aunts and uncles as well as countless other relatives that were murdered due to the hate and antiSemitism that permeated society. To see such unbalanced teachings in our curriculum that can fuel more hate is beyond upsetting. And as we continue to deal with mass shootings, the last thing we need is more fuel for the fire.
The one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and the lack of acknowledgment that anti-Semitism and hate crimes persist in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish students may be stereotyped and harassed. Having grown up in the shadow of the holocaust, I can't imagine the damage from the proposed curriculum.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Glen M Segal
