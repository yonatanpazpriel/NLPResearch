Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
PLEASE please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. It only sounds/seems like Israelis are oppressors and occupiers when their situation is taken wildly out of context. Get real, their neighbors want them dead. They haven't been thru enough? They've got no_place else to go! The Arabs have 19 other countries to call home. If you hate Jews, own it and just say it; don't try to paint Israel as something other than "Blessed life boat" for the last remaining Jews on Earth (thank God).
