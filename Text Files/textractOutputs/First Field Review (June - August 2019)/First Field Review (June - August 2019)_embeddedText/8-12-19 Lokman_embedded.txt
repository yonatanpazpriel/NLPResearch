As a Resident of California, and a Jew, I am dismayed by the inaccuracy and in some case misleading way the ESMC is drafted which strongly reflects an anti-Jewish bias. There is general agreement that Judaism is a form of identity broader than religion. Jews are essentially excluded from the ESMC. This exclusion is insulting and fundamentally inconsistent with the purposes of ethnic studies. The Draft Curriculum Omits Antisemitism, which is essentially a hate crime even though the ESMC specifically discusses bias against other communities. This even as hate crimes against Jews recently took place here in Pittsburgh, PA and in California at the Chabad in Poway this year. I approve the inclusion of "Islamophobia" and other examples in the Glossary, it is unfathomable why antisemitism is not included. It is alarming. The Draft singles out Israel for condemnation and promotes the BDS movement. This condemnation is out of context and factually inaccurate. This strongly suggests that the drafters of the ESMC are promoting their own biases and antisemitism. I urge you to review and significantly edit the ESMC to eliminate the prejudice and bigotry reflected that could fuel hatred and increased discrimination against the Jew community.
