The Privileging of... ...a historically marginalized person or group... (all of it)
Within Ethnic Studies, scholars are often very critical of the system of capitalism as research has shown that Native people and people of color are disproportionately exploited within the system. It is an approach of teaching to recuperate the education and learning of often marginalized diverse students in order to improve themselves, their families and their respective communities. ...other than your own (often historically marginalized groups), without knowledge or respect for the original culture. critical education scholar Tara Yosso introduced the term "cultural wealth" in 2005 in her work, "Whose Culture has Capital? A Critical Race Theory Discussion of Community Cultural Wealth." The term speaks to a broader framework that encompasses various forms of cultural capital--aspirational, linguistic, familial, social, navigational, and resistance-- that are used to empower people. More specifically, the framework is used to better understand and describe what knowledge, experiences, adversities, strengths, etc. students of color bring with them to educational settings. ...scholars often study the implications of Western empires and expansion on people of color globally. The "x" is used to disrupt the often rigid gender binarist approach to telling history. . Latinx differs from Latina/o as the "x" renders the term gender-neutral and more inclusive. Thus, the term can be used by women, men, gender non-binary and trans identifying people.

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This might be a better way to say it:
The focus on... ...a subgroup within the primary/majority population... (This group has so much going on with it that an entire week chould be spent trying to understand BDS, the effects of the boycott, and how/whether their methods are actually effective.) (Please delete this politically charged statement.)
(This sentence isn't really necessary)
...other than your own, without respect for the original culture
As introduced by education scholar Tara Yosso in, "Whose Culture has Capital? A Critical Race Theory Discussion of Community Cultural Wealth," the term encompasses various forms of cultural capital--aspirational, linguistic, familial, social, navigational, and resistance. More specifically, the framework is used to better understand and describe what knowledge, experiences, adversities, strengths, etc. students with them to educational settings.
...scholars often study the implications of Western empires and expansion into other global cultures. The "x" is used to disrupt a gender binarist approach to telling history. (This sentence is only used for Latina/o/x, but not the other X cultures such as Filipina/o/x and Chicana/o/x. Shouldn't it be included in all three, or removed entirely?)

(This is a noble definition. However I disagree that the specific groups listed in this definition � BLM, BDS � do not always use equal rights and justice as their tools. I am unable to offer an improvement on this definition, but please review it a little further. Perhaps you can come up with a more appropriate definition?) (You forgot to italicize the term) movement of people from one region to another. (These two definitions should be identical to each other, except in gender.) (See Wikipedia) is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practise of pedagogy varies greatly, as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts. Anyone who is not considered ethnically white. People of color as a collective identity emerged as a response to systemic racism. People of color are a global majority.
...prior to any contact with an outside culture... ...- a social construct which sorts people...
...lenders, etc., refuse or limit home loans, mortgages, and insurance policies to historically marginalized groups (often Black people). discrimination based on someone's sex or gender. (Discussions of which gender is more frequently discriminated against should be part of a curriculum, not part of the definition.) (This is currently a politically and emotionally charged term, much more than the definition provided. I don't know how to improve this definition, which is excellent as an objective description. But the term "social justice" has been appropriated by groups which do not behave as the objective description would have them behave, and I fear students may be misled.)

Stereotype threat

...Within the context of their research, Steele and Aronson studied Black and White students' performance on academic tests. They concluded that because Black students are often stereotyped as inherently "less competent" or lacking intellectual capacity, they would at times feel a desire to disengage from the learning process and perform those negative stereotypes, thus, impacting their performance on academic and standardized tests.

...For example, a student who belongs to a group which is stereotyped as "less competent" or lacking intellectual capacity, may want to disengage from the learning process and act out those negative stereotypes, resulting in poor academic performance.

Thank you very much for your time and attention.
