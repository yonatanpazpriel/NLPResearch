I'm appalled to find out that you are going to include communist indoctrination and disparage capitalism in the schools. What we have had since the take over by the Central Planners in 1913 is closer to communism's close cousin fascism. Both big govt, centrally planned, leftist ideologies.
That you also plan on teaching the children to read the history of a convicted cop killer, making her a hero, is almost as appalling. What are you folks smoking up there?
No Teaching Communism to Our Children!
