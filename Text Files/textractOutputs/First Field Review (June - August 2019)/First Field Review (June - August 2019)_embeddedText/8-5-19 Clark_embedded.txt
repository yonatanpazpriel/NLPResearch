I can't even say Dear Sirs and Madame as I've lost ANY respect I had for you people.
Are you crazy? This is over the top. In our society, in our schools, and our thinking an open and equal voice and action is being attacked everyday and in every way thinkable.
The schools which we once formed to encourage mental growth, unfettered knowledge, and free constructive thinking are no longer. They are becoming propaganda mills for an agenda we never asked for and it is leading us into to socialism and the control of our children's thinking as they move into adulthood.
Along with the media you who we once relied on have become corrupted into biasness for your own selective causes and party lean. Every day we are surrounded by your brainwash, rhetoric, and the leash and guise of so called political correctness.
Now YOU want to push this same rhetoric into our young children's minds...Hasn't history taught you anything? The founders of our country have turned over in their graves so many times by now that they have no idea which side is up anymore.
