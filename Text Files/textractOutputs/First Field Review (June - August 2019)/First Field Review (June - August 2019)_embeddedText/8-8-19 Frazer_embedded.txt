Page 13, line 307 It is outrageous to list "capitalism" among forms of "oppression." Capitalism has given Californians the highest standard of living in the world. Millions of underprivileged persons have flocked to the United States because of the economic opportunity that capitalism affords. Thousands of people of diverse ethnicities are presently attempting to cross the border into California because of that tremendous economic opportunity. Not all have equal wealth, but all have greater wealth than they would have under any other economic system. The state's educational system is funded by capitalism. The poorest Californians own cell phones and color television sets because of capitalism. While a stated goal is to promote "critical thinking," true critical thinking requires consideration of various viewpoints. Another goal is "cultural empathy," but that requires educating from various perspectives. This program overall is not educational, but merely leftist propaganda. It is anti-Western indoctrination. There is no appreciation for common heritage as Americans. Students would not be taught to understand conflicts or differing ideas, but rather to take sides in favor of a leftist bent. There is a difference between education and indoctrination that is apparently lost on those who developed this curriculum.
