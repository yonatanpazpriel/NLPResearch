I think this is racist. As a white male going to high school in the late 90's, in norwalk la mirada school district, I had to deal with racism everyday. White boy, wedo, etc. were some of the things i was called all the time. It was hard being white. Now my son is going to school and i cant let him go to the school down the street because he'll have to deal with it to.
