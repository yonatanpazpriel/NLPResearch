From: Christine Carson Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 11:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies curriculum
The Ethnic Studies model curriculum addresses numerous forms of bias, but it does not mention antiSemitism, nor does it acknowledge the Jewish people as one of the many ethnic groups that call California home.
I encourage the Board of Education to rethink this important subject matter omission.
