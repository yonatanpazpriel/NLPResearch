From: Loren Shalinsky Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 3:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To CDE/IOQ, I am a long time resident of California and the parent of 2 public high school students in Mountain View, CA. I have recently learned about the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Corriculum, and want to show my concern for the rhetoric that I have found.
I think it is worthwhile to educate students about diversity and different forms of racism and hate. But I am disturbed by the lack of balance within the material, and in particular, the numerous instances of anti-Israel and anti-semitic/Jewish content.
I encourage the Department of education to reconsider the many items that are demeaning to Jewish Americans, and Israel, and to not accept the current draft, nor any draft that perpetuates this type of demeaning rhetoric.
Thank you,
Loren Shalinsky Father of 2 current public high school students 24 year California resident
