Page 2, definition of `BDS'. The definition fails to indicate a stated goal of BDS which is the destruction of the state of Israel. Page 234: The wall separating Israel from the West Bank was created in response to terrorist attacks that killed dozens of israelis. The wall indeed ended that class of attacks. This is hardly the same as U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. 256, 264-26. Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but hardly anything positive about a country with Palestinian doctors and other professionals. This seems pretty one sided. Jews have been a minority persecuted throughout history in Europe and in Arab countries. Even in the US there are isolated anti-Semitic acts against schools and synagogues. It is puzzling that jews are not mentioned as a minority worth protecting from "bigotry, hate, and racism".
