To: California Department of Education
We are deeply concerned with proposed ethnic-studies curriculum in California. It is one-sided anti-Israel, anti-semetic, anti-American, and anti-capitalist rhetoric. This is political indoctrination of our students and is unacceptable.
We stand with the Israel and United States of America Patriotic citizens to please remove this dangerous proposal immediately.
