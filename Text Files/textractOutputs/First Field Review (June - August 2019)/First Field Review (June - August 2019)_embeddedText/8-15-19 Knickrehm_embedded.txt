This "model" for ethnic studies is a betrayal of everything that is American and a dis-service to anyone who wants to live in a free and prosperous USA.
Schools in the USA need to teach American heritage and American values, rather than undermining the principles that have made our country a salvation and a dream destination haven for refugees and immigrants for centuries.
Immigrants should be taught to integrate into what makes for success in this country. They should be taught what safeguards the freedoms and economic opportunities that they seek, namely the US Constitution and Bill of Rights, and economic capitalism that is it's backbone. And especially the English language.
Capitalism assured that individuals can own their own destiny and can make for themselves a better future based on their own efforts and merit. Counter to these ends, Ethnic studies supports a system where individuals are not free -- where people are trapped and beholden to authorities that make or break people based on inherited characteristics (race, ethnicity, gender), which is totally un-American. Ethnic studies is divisive and intolerant, and promotes oppression such as in those governments most immigrants are desperate to escape. Do NOT entrench such repressive concepts into school curriculum in the US.
