gentlemen " i am appalled to learn that you allow antisemites to control the antisemitic curriculum. i doubt that you have heard about the principal of the spanish river hight school in boca raton florida. he emailed a jewish parent saying that not everyone believes that the HOLOCAUST is a fact. there was such a backlash that the principal was fired and the superintendent required all principals to take a course in the sstudy of the holocaust. perhaps the powers that are making the ignorant decision to teach a biased pro palestinian curriculum need to be assigned a lesson in integrity and impartial justice. i cant help wondering if foreign money is influencing decision making. hoping for justice for all to prevail dora kolker.
