The material presented in the overview and subsequent chapters leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of providing a holistic education on ethnicity and it's impact on California. It specifically goes out of it's way to highlight perceived forms of marginalization and the would-be "causes" without providing statistical studies that provide a causal relationship and just accepts the racial divides as the only means of which a person falls into the "achievement gap". The entire premise is intellectually dishonest and does little to educate students on how to tackle such issues such as the achievement gap with solutions that treat root causes rather than covering up the results as they are.

Moreover, this is a poor excuse of a ciriculum that would enhance a student's capacity to think and provide real solutions. The net result from the course would be a student who sees results and then assigns causes based on circumstantial and anecdotal evidence, as opposed to actual social science. The two may or may not lead to the same conclusion, but the journey to discover real causes is the point of any proper educational course. Sadly, this is one that is more rooted in intersectional politics of the moment than real education and has no place in our schools.
