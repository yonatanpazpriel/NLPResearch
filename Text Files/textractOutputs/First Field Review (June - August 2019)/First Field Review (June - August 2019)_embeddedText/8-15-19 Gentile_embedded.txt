Glossary includes definition for "Accompliceship", for being an accomplice for fighting "colonial structures". Surprised that there is not a term for "accomplishment", given the successes of the different ethnic groups in the US that have assimilated into society and thrived. That doesn't fit the current negative narrative that this model curriculum wishes to promote. The glossary contains every PC trope prevalent in today's culture which focusses on complaints, differences, grievance mongering and the splintering of culture and society. Do not foist this on our students � it will serve to drive people apart and focus on the negative, rather than bring people together and focus on the positive, so all can benefit. The emphasis appears to be on wedge concepts that will work to create animosity rather than cohesion. This model curriculum is poison, and school children should not be subjected to this. BDS: Unbelievable that the people that put this model curriculum together think it appropriate to include overt antisemitism as something Californians wish to expose its students to. Needless to say, there will be no mention of the concessions that Israel has made to promote peace, including at least two occasions when a two-state solution was proffered. We deny the proposed inclusion of overt or covert antisemitism in California's schools. Keep it away!

Capitalism: There is a denigrating description of capitalism, the single economic system that has lifted more humans out of poverty than any other. Surprisingly enough, there is no glowing definition for communism or socialism. How restrained of the board that put this together! I guess that they would sneak that in later... In the interest of brevity, as a tax-paying Californian, I take no issue with the school system offering an ethnic studies class. However, the ultra left, politically correct and "social justice warrior" slant displayed in this model curriculum is unacceptable. If the school system's intent is to encourage understanding, a cohesive society of optimistic people willing to work, live and play together, then you will create the exact opposite environment by implementing this approach. However, if you would like to encourage grievance mongering, division, ill-will and lack of social cohesion, then you have found the correct formula. As a taxpayer, I wont support it, and demand that the school abandon this approach and try again.
