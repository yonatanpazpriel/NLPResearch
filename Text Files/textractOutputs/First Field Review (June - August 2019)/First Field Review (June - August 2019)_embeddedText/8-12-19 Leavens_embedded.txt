This section of the sample curriculum is problematic at best. While it is clear these are classroom suggestions, not directives, to even suggest these very controversial steps is utterly anti-Semitic. While Israel's current government (or any government of any country) is never above criticism, to single out Israel for condemnation is discriminatory. This ethnic studies curriculum is about ethnicities in California and the United States. Why is a foreign country even listed, and why ONLY this one?
In addition, the curriculum does not , not include the Jewish community as a group that is worthy of ethnic study AND it does not identify antiSemitism as a problem worthy of study. Instead, the only mention of Judaism and aspects of the Jewish community is to condemn its connection to the state of Israel.
