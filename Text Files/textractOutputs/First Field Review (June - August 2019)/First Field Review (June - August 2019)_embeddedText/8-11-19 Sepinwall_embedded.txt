Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am strongly in favor of Ethnic Studies and am grateful that the state is considering this requirement. However, as someone who teaches courses from an Ethnic Studies perspective both about African Americans, Latinos and Jews, I am disappointed by the almost complete omission of the latter. It is especially startling given that the only appearance of Jews or the State of Israel is in sanctioning teaching about BDS and nothing else. Clearly, anti-Semitism is rising in California (as the murder in Poway by a student from my campus) showed, as well as in the country. Students need to learn about multiple ethnicities and forms of oppression � certainly that directed in our country against African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, people in the LGBTQ+ community, etc., but they also need to learn about the history of religious (and "racial" discrimination) targeted against Jews, Muslims and other religious minorities. And they need to learn about these groups from their own perspectives rather than just as demonized Others. Please do not adopt this framework as proposed, but incorporate religious discrimination and Jewish studies into this framework. Thank you!
