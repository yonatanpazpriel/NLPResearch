This movement has some interesting Gandhi-like ideas and main goals of freedom, justice, and equality for Palestinians; however, the leadership calls for the total destruction of the state of Israel and promotes violence towards Jews

and Israelis. If this topic is placed in curricula and is not taught with opposing

information and perspectives (e.g. about 7 rockets are shot into Israel every day

on average, the hundreds of thousands of Palestinian-Israelis live in relative

peace and comfort in Israel, etc.), it could contribute to a rise in anti-Semitism

and anti-Israel sentiments and violent actions across American campuses. There

have been multiple, verbal and physically violent, bullying actions taken by many

BDS representatives and supporters over the last few years across campuses

and students have been harmed. The information provided by BDS is lacking

accuracy in several ways and provides excuses for increased hate and violence.

This topic should be dealt with carefully. If it is added, Jewish and Israeli history

and perspectives must be added as a counterpoint to provide an impartial,

accurate history.
