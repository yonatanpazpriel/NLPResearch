From: Patti Jo Wolfson Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: curriculum
We realize that the State of California is currently reviewing a model Ethnic Studies curriculum, which openly promotes boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. Moreover, the proposed curriculum includes no lessons about Jews as a sizable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. We are deeply concerned and would like you to reconsider this devastating and dangerous change in the curriculum.
We feel that the ways the draft curriculum neglects the American Jewish narrative; omits discussion of antisemitism as a form of bias and hatred; does not sufficiently reflect Jewish ethnic and cultural identity; and unfairly calls Israel out for condemnation.
Please reconsider this change. We are all promoting a world of love and not a world of hate. Everyone needs to be treated equally and definitely taught that in our schools.
Thank you, Patti Jo Wolfson and Dennis Bernstein
