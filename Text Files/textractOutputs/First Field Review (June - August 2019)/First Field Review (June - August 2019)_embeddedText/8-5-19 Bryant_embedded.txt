Well if California wants to turn into Communist run Cuba or Venezuela than this might be a good education plan . I'm sure Texas will love the plan as more people move there to escape from the once Golden State of California . Bottom line , Socialism/Communism has alway failed wherever it has been tried. It leads to more poverty and less freedom which is not very ethical.
