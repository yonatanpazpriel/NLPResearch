I read the curriculum overview for ethnic studies and must say as an educator (MEdcross cultural education) that it is monument to hate and leftist driven agenda. Where is the positive part of the curriculum that promotes curiosity and teamwork with all diverse groups instead of training non-productive angry activists ? I did not find any worthwhile contribution by the numerous pioneers that created the first Country with a functional Republic that provides opportunities for everyone. This curriculum seems to be designed to generate victims instead of improving the quality of life for everyone in California. Perhaps we need to focus on improving actual core subjects to help students find success instead of frustration and failure. James Adair
