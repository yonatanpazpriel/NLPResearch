From: sschus@aol.com Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 4:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed guidelines for ethnic studies
Ethnic studies is described in the document as "the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity with an emphasis on experiences of people of color in the United States." But that's not all it is. "It is the study of intersectional and ancestral roots, coloniality, hegemony, and a dignified world where many worlds fit, for present and future generations." It is the "xdisciplinary [sic], loving, and critical praxis of holistic humanity."
How about the most important basics you can teach students today to cope with making their way in today's world: specifically, making sure they gain skills of reading, writing, math and critical thinking?
Clearly whoever put these "guidelines" together never learned about critical thinking. They did, apparently, learn about biased thinking and not pushing students to think for themselves after studying all sides of an issue and respecting whatever that person concludes -- whether or not it agrees with what the writers of these guidelines want them to conclude.
This is a travesty and a total waste of taxpayer money as well as doing a major disservice to the kids being educated. I'm fine with introducing a broader scope of history that includes contributions from all ethnicities which weren't fully presented in the past, but not if history is going to be re-written and presented in a such a way as to preclude critical consideration.
I most certainly hope these guidelines will NOT be approved as they stand. Educators need to figure out the best way to teach today's students more about civics, how to think and evaluate facts, along with learning basic skills. Coding would be an excellent skill to include as well.
