Hello,
As a CA educated student, taxpayer and Jew, I was surprised my people (Jews) were omitted from the curriculum and the manner in which we were portrayed.
I ask that BDS be deleted and the conclusion equating Mexico and Palestine be deleted. These are opinion topics and don't provide a balanced view for a first time learner.
Thanks, Colin -Colin E. Specter Principal CA
