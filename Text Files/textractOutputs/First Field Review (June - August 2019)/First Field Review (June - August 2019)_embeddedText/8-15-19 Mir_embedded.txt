I am concerned that inaccurate information is included in this curriculum . It Appears to have an antisemitic flavor to it. Goes against The very basis for tge ethnic study. I urge you to revisit anything that has negative narrative relating to Israel and it's prople. Example: Contains historical inaccuracies that skew the truth against Israel. In one section, it defines "Israel-Palestine" as a country ( has not happened yet)?. In another, recommended song lyrics refer to the "Israeli colony." Also references to the boycotting of Israeli products affirmed. Please let me know how you have corrected this.
