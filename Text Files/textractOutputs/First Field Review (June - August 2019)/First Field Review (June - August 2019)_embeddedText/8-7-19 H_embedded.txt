From: Orly H Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 10:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum - Racist!
To the ethics studies development group, I find several of the suggested topics hate filled and simply racist! You must reconsider and offer a balanced approach. You should not promote racism against jewish groups which you clearly currently do. Please reconsider!!!
I will be happy to testify or provide further details. Let me know how.
Thank you, An extremely concerned citizen
