Pg 2 line 27-30 � Conspicuously leaves out antisemitism. In fact, the entire document leaves out antisemitism as a form of "oppression". The document then discusses and cites many antisemitic tropes or at least it presents a question mark whether or not it was antisemitic. In my view, this curriculum does not fulfill the legislative mandate's intent. Instead, it appears that this "Model" is being used to promote political issues and racial divide. While reading The Model Curriculum , it had been my intention to make comments to each concern that arose. So I tabbed each concern and upon finishing the entire document, I realized the problem is not with a couple of comments here and there. I started to believe that there might have been a fundamental problem with the committee that drafted it. Upon reviewing the list of advisory committee members and looking at their bios, it is clear that incredible bias and the opportunity for partisans to inject into a state document their own personal beliefs exist. For example: one member, Samia Shoman, a PalestinianAmerican, is directly tied to organizations and groups that have efforts to proliferate boycotts of Israel. Her Twitter account also shows that she is a pro-Palestinian activist.
I also note in the selection of the advisory committee members, there are many who have written books on ethnic studies and it appears that there was an effort to have a cross-section for Chicano studies, Black studies, racial studies, Chinese and other ethnic groups, along with Islam issues, but curiously nothing to do with Jewish studies, the Holocaust, Jewish persecution even though when looking at all the statistics in California of hate crimes, there has been a dramatic increase in antiSemitic hate crimes. Yet, there's no representation on the Advisory Committee. From my perspective, this document should not be corrected. Instead, it should have a doover. The do-over should be unbiased and cover all points of view. Of course, it should discuss racism, Islam phobia, sexual discrimination, sexual preference and frankly, everything else. But it should also include antisemitism as well. Not including it, either condones antisemitism or shows an incredible insensitivity by the very people who are drafting the models for others to follow.
