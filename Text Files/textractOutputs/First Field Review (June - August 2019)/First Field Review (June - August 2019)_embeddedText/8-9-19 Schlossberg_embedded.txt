Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 2 - Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) definition is flawed. Palestinians do not live under apartheid conditions in Israel--in fact, Palestinian leaders are part of the Knesset (government). This is a heavily biased definition that misrepresents the reality of life in Israel for minority groups.

Chapter 2: Sample Course Models

Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 � This sample course material distorts the reality of life in Israel for minority groups, and does a disservice to students who are trying to learn the history and root causes of conflict in the Middle East. I also think it's a reflection on the poor quality of California public education that hip hop songs are being used to teach students. This type of wasteful nonsense in the classroom is a major reason why so many parents (including myself) in California are spending so much money to send our children to private school. Please stop wasting our tax dollars, and bring back quality education (including the presentation of opposing perspectives on controversial issues) to all schools.
