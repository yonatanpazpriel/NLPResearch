Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I was just recently in Hungary, where the lack of appropriate teaching was very obvious. Despite that country's terrible involvement in rounding up Jews for deportation during the Holocaust, the government has decided to pretend that never happened. The Holocaust is not even mentioned in school curricula. As a result the younger people I met had little to no knowledge of those horrific events, which is quite frightening given the current environment of anti- Semitism and anti-immigrants prevalent in Hungary and other "democratic" countries of eastern Europe. Please do not let that happen here!
I again urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Jeff Greenberg
