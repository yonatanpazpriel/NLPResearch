From: Mary Lee Noonan Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 4:58 PM To: Superintendent Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
The text of the "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum" is beyond satire. Instead of providing an articulate, clearly reasoned analysis of an important subject, it drowns the topic in a sea of jargon and politicizing that reads like a satirical joke. The suggestion that this would be a "model" for the teachers of the state is an embarrassment to all Californians.
Sincerely yours,
Mary Lee Noonan Berkeley, CA
