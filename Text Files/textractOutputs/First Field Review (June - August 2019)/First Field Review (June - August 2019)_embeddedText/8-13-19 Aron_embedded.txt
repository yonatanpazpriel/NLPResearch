Dear Committee Members,
As Jewish citizens of the State of California we were dismayed to read about the proposed curriculum for ethnic studies in our public schools. Like most Jews we see ourselves as more than individuals with a particular religious belief. Rather, we see ourselves as belonging to a people with a common history and a common culture of which religion is a part. Certainly we have contributed to the fabric of life in California and the country as a whole, and as we have seen in recent events we have been the victims of hate just as many other groups have been the victims of hate in our state and our country.
In our opinion for Jews to be left out of the curriculum for ethnic studies is more than mere oversight. We feel that it is a reflection of the bias, perhaps unrealized, by the writers of the proposed curriculum. Furthermore we feel that the State of Israel, among all the states of the world, is unjustly singled out for condemnation.
We lend our voice to those who support the Jewish community and the Jewish people, and ask only that when formulating a study curriculum for the students of this State that we be treated with the same respect as all other people.
Sincerely,
Frances Aron and Gary Aron
