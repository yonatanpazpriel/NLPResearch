From: Jacquelyn Ann Ross Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 11:19 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment on proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum
Dear Staff and Committee Members, Thank you for your work on this important curriculum.
With regard to Native American issues, while Standing Rock is an excellent example of a movement that caught national attention, the Winnemem Wintu struggle in Northern California brings up disparate issues and its inclusion would provide recognition that the Native population in California is unique in comparison to the history of other states, notably with regard to treaty ratification. Among the issues that could be explored: lack of Federal recognition; the conversion of traditional village site to a recreational campsite; the delay of a traditional puberty ceremony due to Shasta Dam issues; and serious issues with salmon habitat.
Thank you for your consideration of these comments. Sincerely, Vic Yellow Hawk White
