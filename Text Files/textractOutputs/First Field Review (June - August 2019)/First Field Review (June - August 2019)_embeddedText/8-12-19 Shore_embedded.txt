I hereby indicate my support for the position of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, as stated in their letter dated July 29,2019, addressed to Soomin Chao, chair of the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Department of Education, in opposition to the presently configured Ethnic Studies Curriculum currently being proposed. It appears to be a course of study that purposely belittles the Jewish experience, people, Israel, and all their historical accomplishments. Some obvious anti-Semitism is clearly being featured in the current iteration of the curriculum. I sincerely hope it fails to be included in the final version. Otherwise, shame on all of you involved in suggesting that curriculum.
