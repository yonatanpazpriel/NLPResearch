Pg 234: Boycott Divestment & Sanctions of Israel is illegal under US Federal law due to its discriminatory nature. It hurts all Israelis and Palestinians. Even Abbas, Palestinian president, opposes BDS. It has no place in an Ethnic studies handbook, except to showcase how bigoted and destructive to everyone opponents of Israel are.

Pg 242: Nakba (Catastrophe) is a politically charged term which ignores the details of the war which was initiated against the nascent Jewish state by all of the neighbors in an attempt to kill it.

Pg: 268 � Anti-semitic trope that Jews control the media. Denies Israel is a country by calling it a colony.
For every free political prisoner, an Israeli colony is expanded For each greeting, a thousand houses were
demolished They use the press so they can manufacture, but when my sentence is judged, reality presents itself

The majority of religious hate crimes in America, 58.1% are against Jews � FBI statistics. Yet, nowhere in the curriculum is this mentioned. These hate crimes are fueled by prejudices that are covered for other ethnic groups, but conspicuously antiSemitic canards are absent.
