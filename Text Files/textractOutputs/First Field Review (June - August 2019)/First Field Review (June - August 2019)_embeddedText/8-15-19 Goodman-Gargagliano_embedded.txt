I am writing to urge the department to include Arab studies in the curriculum. Arab people are particularly marginalized, demonized and stereotyped in our society. I believe the CDE has a responsibility to provide students with a humanist grounding in Arab history and experience in order to combat bullying and hate directed at Arab students, and to help foster a sense of pride in one's history for Arab students who may be suffering from bullying.
