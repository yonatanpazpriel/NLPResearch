The proposed curriculum, in its current form, does not reflect California's diverse population. Armenian, Jewish, Greek, Hindu and Korean communities are ethnic groups that have greatly contributed to the fabric of California and excluding their stories from Ethnic studies is unacceptable.
I respectfully request that the Armenian experience is included in the final version of the ethnic studies model curriculum.
