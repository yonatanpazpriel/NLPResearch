This proposed curriculum needs to be looked at again with the following pointers to be considered: 1) It is most important that lessons be added about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, experienced oppression in the Middle East and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. 2)The value of inclusion of ALL minorities is important when teaching young minds. 3)Advocating for The BDS movement, which promotes hate and division is not what we want to encourage. 4)A false equivalence is established when Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people is compared to US policies on the border with Mexico. 5) Unclear language is used that implies that "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237). 6) No alternative perspectives are offered when the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War is described (p. 242). 7) Harsh criticism of Israel is encouraged without content being offered with a positive perspective

about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269). 8) It i disappointing that the Jewish narrative is excluded with antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people being such a major problem in our society. This goes against the stated objective of this curriculum, i.e., "enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry hate, and racism."
