I am writing to express my feelings in the ethic studies curriculum. I feel the idea is important but feel you have excluded the s Jewish people and have put a slant against them.
With the new CHYA curriculum, we must teach all sides to give everyone a fair chance. In this curriculum you are only on Palestine's side. It is WRONG
Here are a few concerns with the curriculum include:  Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned.  Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religiousbased hate crimes in the United States are against Jews.  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no balancing perspective.
