From: Judy Rosenbaum Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 9:11 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC Concerns
I am writing as a Californian and retired state educator concerned with the anti-Jewish bias evident in the ESMC. The promotion of the BDS movement is a glaring anti-Semitic component, proof of which can be found in the significant rise of hate crimes against Jews. College campuses throughout California and the U.S. have seen many more anti-Semitic acts, cruelty, vandalism and marginalizing of Jewish students. We grieve for worshippers gunned down in Pittsburgh and Poway. Your promotion of BDS in the ESMC will further fuel hate and mistrust, tactics reminiscent of Nazi propaganda. Why would the California Department of Education seek to further the anti-Jewish BDS movement in curriculum such as this?
I join others in the state and in the Jewish community who recognize the danger and anti-Semitic bias found in the ESMC. It's imperative that these concerns are addressed.
Sincerely, Judy Rosenbaum
