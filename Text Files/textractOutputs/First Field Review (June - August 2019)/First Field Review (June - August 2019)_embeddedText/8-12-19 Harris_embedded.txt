From: Cindy Harris Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 11:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for the State of California High Schools
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very troubled about the proposed inaccurate and biased content in the Instructional Quality Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. In my 20+ years of teaching in the California public schools, I and my fellow teachers made every effort to present a balanced social studies curriculum accurately representing the views of our beautifully diverse population of California. We did not get to pick and choose presentation of views that served our personal narratives. Nor should the State of California adopt a flawed curriculum proposal is so obviously biased against Jews. I was dismayed to find the following:
 Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned  ï¿½ Anti-Semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious-
based hate crimes in the United States are against Jews  The divisive BDS movement, which seeks to erase the state of Israel, is included with no
balancing perspective  A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included
I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I respectfully request the board to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
As a retired teacher, I am extremely disappointed that public education in this country, and in particular, the State of California, would even consider enacting this curriculum which is filled with false narratives. Our country's high schools and universities have a responsibility to teach these young students in a fair and unbiased manner.
I urge you to rewrite the curriculum, resulting in a truthful representation of the diverse ethnicities in the State of California.
Thank you,
Cindy S. Harris
