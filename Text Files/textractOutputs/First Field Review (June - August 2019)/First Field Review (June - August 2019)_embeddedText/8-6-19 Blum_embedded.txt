The glossary states that the BDS Movement against Israel is intended to end Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. It makes no mention of Palestinians living in Israel who are members of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament), serve in the armed forces, have full access to Israeli health and education systems, have freedom to travel anywhere within or outside of Israel, etc. This is not consistent with apartheid as it applied to blacks living in South Africa under white rule.

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 237 refers to Israel-Palestine as an Arab country. Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East. Palestinian residents have full rights as Israeli citizens but there is no independent country called Palestine.
Page 242 is a one-sided narrative of the 1948 war. Historians recognize that, upon the withdrawal of British troops in 1948, Palestinians were granted an independent state in portions of the former Palestine mandate just as Jews were granted land to create the new state of Israel. Rather than accepting this two-state solution, the surrounding Arab countries immediately invaded the new state of Israel with the stated intention of "driving the Jews into the sea" so that they could establish a 100% Arab state in the former Palestine. Had they accepted the British offer and been willing to live in peace with their Israeli neighbors, 70 years of war and suffering would have been avoided.
