As a Jewish woman reading this, I was offended. Antisemitism is a significant issue in America today due to the rise of white supremacists. Last year, California had 341 antisemitic incidents, the highest out of all 50 states (ADL). For someone who runs this state to seemingly celebrate anti-Semites like Ilhan Omar and refer to our homeland as a combination of a defunct name is frankly offensive. It is also shocking hearing this from a place that is seemingly tolerant of all lifestyles. I have two words for you, California Legislature: do better. Thank you.
