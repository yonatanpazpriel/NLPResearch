Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. As referenced in Chapter 1 on page 11 (line 266) and in Chapter 2 on page 1 (lines 19 and 22), Arabs and Pacific Islanders are particularly marginalized communities that are not well represented in current course offerings. I support the objectives listed on pages 233-289 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students. Including a history of migration to the USA is necessary for any marginalized community, and in particular for Arab Americans at this time. Teaching this history will help create a bridge between migrant communities and celebrate the rich history of a growing population. I support being reasonably proficient with terms as found in the Glossary and relevant to being informed and articulate about ethnic studies and social diversity and about the place of Arab Americans in particular in society at this time. I support using UC-approved materials to teach the diverse history of Arab Americans as indicated on pages 2, 5, 42, and 52.
