This entire document is nothing but naked ideological propaganda. It is harmful to white people, men and boys, and Jews overtly and also is damaging to all people by teaching that it is acceptable to hate and degrade others who do not hold the same ideologically correct points of view. There is no truth to this document and it reads as though it was some of the trash easily found on realpeerreview.
