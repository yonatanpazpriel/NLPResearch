I'm totally disgusted as to what California has become. It amazes me at the type of junk kids are learning in school.
Instead of teaching them this far left material, you should be touching them, respect, integrity, selfishness, self respect.....etc. but you stir them to the left. Thats the problem n will be the problem for many years.
Kids expect fast service, easy work, more money when they lack the experience, customer service skills, creativity, and so on.
Its so sad! What these kids are going through n will be taught.
Kids should be taught rhe real history of this nation n not what happen to Mexico, Turkey, Korea, Israel.
Other countries do not teach out history so why would we....
If the state wants to teach this shit, then give the parents the option of opting out of these stupid classes.
GIVE US THE RIGHT TO TAKE OUR KIDS OUT...THAT WILL BE FAIR. BUT IF U INSIST N MAKE IT MANDATORY THEN SORRY BUT THAT WONT FLY.....
WHERE ARE OUR RIGHTS AS PARENTS?
