Page 234 � I am very concerned about the topic around Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel. Some countries like Germany deemed this movement anti-Semitic. BTW the whole document refers to xenophobia, islamophobia and other forms of racism but nowhere did I found references to anti-Semitism. This is a strange omission given that for a few years now, and according to the FBI, Jews have suffered more from ethnical violence in the USA than any other group. The BDS movement is rooted in hatred for Jews and some of its members have been involved in protests at Holocaust memorials and related events and have openly expressed the desire to see the eradication of the sole and only Jewish State. So I wonder why this topic is included in Arab American studies unless it would be to denounce it for what it is. The next topic is titled Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico which seems a way to create false comparisons to attract sympathy for those who bash Israel and incriminate its people. Why not compare Mexico with Kashmir or any other place with disputed territories?. This association has been done before to bring the Israel Arab conflicts in narratives totally disconnected with the Middle East (e.g BLM, Ferguson). This is done frequently to demonize Israel and gather support for anti-Israel narratives. Some of the

Potential Significant Figures to Cover include Linda Sarsour who recently stated proudly that Jesus was a Palestinian refugee. This kind of rhetoric should be dismissed and the people who created them should not become some sort of key figures to study as part of this ethnic group. Jesus was Jewish; he was born in Judea and the term Philistine did not even exist until two centuries after his death. I could go on and on with all the troubling parts of this curriculum which seems ripe to condition students and present distorted historical facts and misrepresents some people and organizations while omitting to expose their true nature. I am very concerned of potential repercussions against Jewish kids. The list of Arab Americans includes mostly anti-Israel activists who have notoriously spread fraudulent claims against the Jewish State. L.Sarsour with the Women's March has advocated for a narrative that prevents Jewish women from marching safely especially given the non-denunciation of L.Farrakhan antisemitsm.

Several Arab Americans could be included instead of E.Said, L.Sarsour or Rashida Tlaid. You could include for example Zuhdi Jasser who is a medical doctor, cardiologist who has received numerous awards. He is also a frequent speaker on national security. You could include Raheel Raza who is a Pakistani-Canadian journalist, author and public speaker. What about Donna Shalala who is a current Lebanese member of Congress representing Democrats. Charlie Crist, also a Democrat, is also from Lebanon. And what about Brigitte Gabriel who is an Lebanese-American author. There are plenty of Arab Americans to choose from who are not anti-Israel bigots and activists.
