From: Sandi Fahn Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: model curriculum that promotes ignorance & anti-Semitism
To Whom It May Concern: Although I recognize and appreciate the need for public school curriculum that promotes understanding and respect for historically excluded ethnic groups, I am deeply disturbed by the blatant absence of Jews from the curriculum. Hate crimes against Jews are surging in California, more so than against any other ethnic group. Anti-Semitism is surging all over the world. Your proposed curriculum defeats the purpose of an ethnic studies curriculum by excluding the Jewish experience from the dialogue. It promotes ignorance, bias and racism by including anti-Semitic stereotypes and glorifying BDS. As a California resident and mother of two California public school students, I respectfully request that the draft of the model curriculum be revised to address the above concerns. Sandi Fahn
