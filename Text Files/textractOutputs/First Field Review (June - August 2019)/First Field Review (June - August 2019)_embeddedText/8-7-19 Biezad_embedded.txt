This overall document suffers from what I consider indoctrination taking the place of critical thinking. In my opinion, the contents promote only the conclusions that result from accepting one point of view of a complex issue (for example, the view that capitalism and the ownership of property are inherently oppressive, while ignoring the historical excesses of communism). This chosen point of view is supported by "cherry-picking" academic opinions that support those one-sided conclusions and by inserting them into lesson plans. This is the opposite of liberal education as I understand it.

More principles from Martin Luther King and examples of inclusivity and diversity from other generally accepted paragons of moral virtue (Mother Teresa, Spinoza, Dostoevsky, Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, etc. etc.) are solely needed in both the course goals and the course lesson plans.

I recommend using the existing document as a draft, and then strive to include material from moderate and imaginative conservatives (Russell Kirk, Thomas Sowell, and Irving Babbitt come to mind).

Teaching students to hold their existing culture in contempt and to find redress of grievances through the emotion of victimization will not end well. It is an ideology that reminds me of Rousseau's view (liberty, equality, and fraternal pity) that, in the extreme, led to the excesses of the French Revolution, and concluded by defaulting to Hobbes' dim view of humanity (liberty, equality, and perpetual conflict).

Stick to John Locke (liberty, equality, and reason), where equality implies equity and reason implies a constrained government that protects its citizens from the fruits of their labor (property). These Lockean views provide for enough overlap of moderate progressivism and an imaginative conservatism that both "check and balance" the political process and that point society and human behavior toward the "common good."
