Document seems to ignore any Jewish ethnicity or anti-Semitic issues, yet regularly relates to Islamophobia and anti-Arab or anti-Muslim issues. Document demonizes Israel but rarely mentions any other nation in a negative way. Document refers to the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement in the Glossary a a positive social movement, again demonizing Israel as an apartheid nation. Demonizing Israel and discussing BDS are outside the bounds of ethnic studies as no other nation is mentioned in a similar way anywhere in the curriculum. On page 234, 268, and 269, anti-Israel statements and rap songs are shown. This course if for ethnic studies in the United States. It negatively mentions a single nation other then the United States, which is not related to the course. Meanwhile, it never mentions Jews as a group that endures discrimination or violence, while mentioning it for many other groups.
