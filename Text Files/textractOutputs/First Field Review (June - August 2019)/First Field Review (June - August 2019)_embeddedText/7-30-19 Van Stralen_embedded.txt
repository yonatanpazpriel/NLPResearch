This so called studies is just propaganda and not beneficial for developing critical thing skills for our young. Stop the studies and gather a diverse group that includes parents and businesses leaders to develop studies that offer a positive message, opportunity and prosperity
Also, I will not financially support California public schools nor hire young people fed this kind of crap. I will hire young people who conduct their lives objectively, care and strive for prosperity
