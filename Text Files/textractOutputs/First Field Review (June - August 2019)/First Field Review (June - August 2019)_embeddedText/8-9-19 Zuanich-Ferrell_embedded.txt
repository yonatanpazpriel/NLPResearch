According to the draft curriculum, the "guiding values and principles" of each lesson in ethnic studies will "cultivate empathy," share stories of "struggle and resistance" and "critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society."

It's beyond troubling that "capitalism" is included on the roll call of oppression. Capitalism is the economic system of a free country. It represents voluntary trade to mutual benefit, without government coercion. It has been the means of humanity's greatest advances in human lifespan, technological achievement and standard of living.

Teaching high school students that capitalism is oppression, without examining the outcomes of some of history's other paths, is not education. It is leftist propaganda.
The ethnic studies curriculum appears to be one-sided by design, perhaps out of a belief that every other part of a student's education is presented from the "imperialist/colonial hegemonic" point of view.
I recommend throwing away this curriculum guide.
