As a parent, and a former teacher, the best approach to widening a child's perspective comes from providing children to study a range of ideas ( that means a variety of ideologies and perspectives, especially ones in contrast), and allowing them to choose a side, to dispute and debate those ideas, and through this process to sharpen their research and thinking skills. If we, as parents and citizens, want to raise children who ultimately think and decide for themselves, then we need to provide curriculum that allows for that.

This curriculum fails to do that in so many ways.

They deserve curriculum that emphasizes the often ugly, deep-rooted and complex facts of racial and ethnic history, one that presents and respects differences of opinion, and encourages respectful, open, and sincere discussion on difficult issues.

We can do better for our children here in California.
