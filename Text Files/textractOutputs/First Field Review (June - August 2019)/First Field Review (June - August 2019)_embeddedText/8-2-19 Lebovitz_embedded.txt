Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Please remove all BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum.
The definition of "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS)" compares Israel to South Africa. Having visited Israel nine times and lived there for a year with my wife and children, I see no comparison between the two situations. These lessons encourage teachers to advocate for Palestinians and create a false narrative about Israel. In addition, these lessons draw a false comparison between the American border situation, which is about refugees, and the Israeli border attempt to defend itself from terror.
Further, the War of Independence in 1948 is entirely portrayed from the Palestinian perspective.

General

The poem (p. 256, 264-269) utilizes extreme language about Israel without any consideration of the failure of Palestinian leadership or the choices made by Palestinians by pursuing terror. Why is there no Jewish unit in ethnic studies? Holocaust studies and Zionsim and Israel should be explored from the Jewish perspective, which I believe coincides with the factual perspective.
