IChapter 1. Course overview: The field critically grapples with the various power structures and forms of
oppression, including, but not limited to, white supremacy, race and racism, sexism, classism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, that continue to impact the social, emotional, cultural, economic, and political experiences of Native People/s and people of color.
Why is anti-semitism not included in this listing. The shooting at the Poway synagogue shows that it is certainly alive and well. Or doesn't murder count as racism?

P. 234: 237,237,242, 256, 264. 269. The Nakbah is mentioned but not the Holocaust. The Implication is that Jews came to Palestine with the motives of European Imperialists. While BDS participation is freedom of speech, there is more than one view of the motives of BDS. While Palestinian organizations are mentioned, Jewish organizations like J Street and Voice for Peace, supportive of Palestinian rights, are not. While I acknowledge that the Palestinian conception of the establishment of the State of Israel should and must be acknowledged and honored, the United Nations resolution 180 is also a part of the picture. Is this history or herstory, or an anti Israel polemic?
