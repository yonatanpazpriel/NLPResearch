From: Ben Ellis Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 2:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: deeply disturbed by antisemitic educational content that may become mandatory in California
I was deeply troubled to learn that California is considering to make mandatory as part of its education a curriculum that is antisemitic in the ethnic studies curriculum. Apparently "ethnic" does not include jewish or judaism - but it is OK to present as "fact" a completely one-sided view of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
The glossary includes islamophobia, homophobia, racism, transphobia, sexism, and classism. But not antisemitism?!? Apparently California does not think that antisemitism exists... or that it is not important for kids to learn as part of an ethnic studies curriculum.
I was also bothered by the definition of capitalism, includes "free market" in quotation marks (as if to indicate that it is not mislabeled) and which ended with, "In a capitalist economy, surplus value (profit) is generated from human labor and everything is commodified." There are many sources of profit besides human labor (e.g., ideas) and not everything is commodified.
For comparison, here is how Merriam Webster defines capitalism: "an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market."
As a parent living in California with two school-age children, l find it abhorrent that California would mandate a curriculum that would serve to increase hate and misunderstanding. In particular given the broader national challenges that we face as a country.
Thank you for your consideration, Ben Ellis
