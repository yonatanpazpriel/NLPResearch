Jewish Community/Anti-semitism - the curriculum addresses many types of hate/disadvantages/stereotypes suffered by minority groups, but completely misses the opportunity to talk about the rising hate-crimes directed towards individuals and groups in the Jewish Community. This fits well in the curriculum (should include key concepts � Chapter 2, page 3) and should not be missed. Anti-Semitism as a term should also be included in the Glossary alongside terms such as "racism", "sexism", "transphobia", "xenophobia" etc. BDS - the definition of BDS in the glossary is misleading and inaccurate. I believe that the BDS movement is a hate/anti-semitic organization veiled as a "global social movement". Having BDS on the same list as #BlackLivesMatter, the Feminist Movement and LGBTQ Movement really denigrates those movements and the others on the list.
Please remove BDS from the "List of Potential Social Movements" (Chapter 2, page 35) and "Sample Topics" (Chapter 2, page 234). Having this group on these lists will bring hate into the classroom which is exactly opposite of the intent of the ESMC. I would also recommend removing topics "Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter" and "Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico".

Israel � Why is there such an unbalanced, anti-Israel sentiment in the curriculum regarding Israel and the Palestinian people? There are arguments on both sides, but those are not represented in the curriculum and do not belong in this curriculum.
The 1948 Arab-Israeli war, known in Israel as the War of Independence, is referred to as the "1948 Palestine War," and the creation of Israel is referred to as the "Nakba," Arabic for "catastrophe." (Chapter 2, pages 236 and 242). Plus, there are references in the curriculum to Palestinian songs with inflammatory lyrics and anti-semitic public leaders. Please remove/correct these references.
