It appears that these studies do not include the Jewish population. They have been an important part of this Nation's development...since the very beginning. And since it is obvious that anti-semitism is again on the rise in the world at large..this must be addressed in these studies. I will be following the outcome and all in my circle will be made aware of the outcome
