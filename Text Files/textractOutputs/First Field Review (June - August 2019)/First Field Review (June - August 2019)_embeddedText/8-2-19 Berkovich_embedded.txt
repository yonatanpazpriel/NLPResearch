I respectfully request the removal of BDS and other hate filled anti-Israel bias from this model curriculum. As a parent of two children and husband of a California educator, I value inclusion and the presentation of other perspectives. American Jews are an ethnic group that should be included in your curriculum and not delegitimized and demonized by hate groups like the BDS movement which promote division and ultimately seek to end Israel's existence. The curriculum needs to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and the former Soviet Union. There are no alternative perspectives on your lesson plans other than those that feature harsh criticism of Israel and no criticism of Palestinian leaders. In the introduction to the curriculum it states your wish is to "develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aid in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism." Based on this draft of the curriculum, which does not feature a single lesson about Jews and does nothing to address ignorance and rising antisemitism, there is an obvious disconnect between your stated goals and what this curriculum achieves.
