As a professor in the University of California system, I'm dismayed at the blatant Anti-Semitic content being proposed in the 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for our California high schools. I would like to help by suggesting some needed corrections. It is important for our California students to understand the history of Jews in the United States (and California) and also be presented with a measured teaching of Israel today and its relations with the Palestinian territories and neighboring lands. Attached are my comments.
I would be grateful if you and your committee would consider my comments as you create the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
With kind regards,
