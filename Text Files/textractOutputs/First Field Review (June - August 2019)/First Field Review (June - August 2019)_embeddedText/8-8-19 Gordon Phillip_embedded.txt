The presentation of the BDS movement is biased and inconsistent with the curriculum's stated goal of teaching tolerance. The ESMC's support of the BDS movement in the curriculum ironically hurts the very groups it is purported to help. Presenting a biased and slanted account of the BDS movement misstates the intent of the movement and fuels hatred and intolerance. The authors of the ESMC are also abusing the trust of students in presenting false and inaccurate information and will themselves be responsible for generating hatred and intolerance.

The ESMC is disrespectful of both Jews and Israel and the authors are duplicitous in presenting false information to student as the truth.
