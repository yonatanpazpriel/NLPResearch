Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
page 2 and also pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 Iam opposed to this curriculum and urge my home state of California to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. lt is vital as a state that we value inclusion. BDS promotes hate and division. That is not what our state, my home state for almost 60 years is all about. I urge you to address this immediately. Iwork with many teenagers that attend public California schools and it saddens me to think that our state doesn't hold inclusion at the top of its list of priorities. At a time when the country and our state needs to stand together, it is imperative that California take care of this right away. I thank you for making this a priority.
