From: Michele T. Parker Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 2:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Request for a significant rewrite of ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am concerned and saddened by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I am a great supporter of a public school education but this is unacceptable. It is not fair to my 2 Jewish children, to our community, to an entire generation, to completely leave out a discussion of anti-semitism. In the past 2 years alone, a swastika was found painted on a wall in my university as well as my child's elementary school. Nazi symbols are meant to frighten and intimidate Jewish people and our youth need to be taught that the use of these symbols in unacceptable.
ESMC focuses heavily on power structures and forms of oppression including white supremacy, sexism, classism, Islamophobia, transphobia -- but excludes anti-Semitism. Anti-Jewish bias receives only a passing mention during a discussion of intersectionality in a proposed course on Pacific Islander studies. A 22-page glossary and bibliography has entries for Islamophobia and racism, but none for anti-Semitism. Anti-semitic hate crimes rose by 21% in California in 2018, and are continuing to rise. This is not a time to shirk your responsibility to teach about and thus protect the Jewish people.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Sincerely, Michele T. Parker, Ph.D.
