I recently read the article regarding the possible "ethnic studies" class that would teach that Capitalism is racist. Really? As a truck driver, I deliver weekly to many businesses, big and small, that are owned by Hispanics, Asians, and African Americans. These are people that have benefitted from a Capitalist economy and have paid their taxes. California is full of businesses that would not exist if it weren't for Capitalism. Yet once again the state of California is doing everything it can to promote the Socialist/Marxist agenda and now you want to indoctrinate your children into these beliefs. This is insanity and it's doing a disservice to those children. Racism exists, and unfortunately it always will. But to label everything you don't agree with as racist has devalued the term and diminishes actual incidents of racism.
As teachers, your job is to teach children...math, history (all history), science, etc., not to promote a political agenda. California has consistently ranked below the national average according to Education Week magazine...41st in conditions that help children succeed, 39th in school finance, and 30th in achievement. That was In January 2017. This is a trend that has continued for years.
Rather than teach children a political agenda, teach them what they need to know to actually succeed in the world.
