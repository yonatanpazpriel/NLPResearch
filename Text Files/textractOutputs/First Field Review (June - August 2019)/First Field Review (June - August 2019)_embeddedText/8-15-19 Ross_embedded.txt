From: Elizabeth Ross Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Input/Arab Studies Inclusion
To Whom It May Concern,
I strongly support the objectives listed on page 233 outlining the benefits of including Arab Studies in our California curriculum. This is a time to learn about each other - and ourselves - through culture and exchange. I believe that it is a profound issue at this time.
Sincerely, Elizabeth D. Ross Philo, Ca. 95466
