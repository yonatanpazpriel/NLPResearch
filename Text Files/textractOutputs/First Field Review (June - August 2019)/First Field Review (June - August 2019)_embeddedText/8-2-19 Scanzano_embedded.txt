Page 2 of Glossary Bibliography ESMC. A glossary for the curriculum includes a definition of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence.
Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of Sample Course Materials. The sample lesson plans for the curriculum:
� Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
� Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
� Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
� Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
