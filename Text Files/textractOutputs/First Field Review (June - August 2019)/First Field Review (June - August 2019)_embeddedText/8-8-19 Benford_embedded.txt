From: Gregory Benford Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 10:25 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: warped views abound
This proposed agenda is rife with favored views that obscure history and assume values contrary to much of America. It omits antisemitism, lists capitalism as a method of oppression (but not socialism), and does not consider free markets a positive good. Either rewrite this agenda or drop the idea.
