From: Bernard Gilmore Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 9:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: California Ethnic Studies Draft
The Ethnic Studies draft is in need of revision for both inclusions and omissions in regard to representation of Judaism as a religion, tradition and civilization, and the state of Israel as well. Anti-Semitic incidents of all kinds are burgeoning at an alarming rate in our country and world-wide. Educational content presented in a clear unbiased way in an important course such as this is crucial because it will reach young minds that are open to ideas but have no way to judge the presentation. The content as it stands is badly in need of editing and revision.
