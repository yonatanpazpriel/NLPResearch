SBE's "Guidelines for Ethnic Studies Curriculum" require that these materials be "based on current and confirmed research" and provide students a "rigorous analysis of history, systems of oppression, and the status quo." CDE's "History and Social Science Framework for California Public Schools" requires that narratives, when used, present an "accurate" picture of the times.
This part is not based on sound research and so needs to be revised: The two songs that are included conflate the viewpoint of indigenous peoples in Africa and Latin America with the "Free Palestine" idea that the Jewish people somehow don't belong in the indigenous Jewish homeland. No material is included recognizing the Jews as the indigenous people of the Levant.
Suggested revision: Eliminate these songs and choose other materials that don't conflate the IsraelPalestine conflict with unrelated issues

This part is not based on sound research and so needs to be revised:the statement "The largest single group was Palestinian" is not substantiated by available information. This site http://www.arabamericanstories.org/arab-americans/home-countries/ indicates that Arab-Americans of Lebanese and Syrian descent outnumbered Palestinian-Americans by a factor of 9:1. This nonpartisan site https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/middle-eastern-and-north-african-immigrants-united-states states " The 1948 Arab-Israeli War and revolutions in Egypt and Iraq in the 1950s triggered the second wave of MENA migration. In part a result of the restrictive U.S. quota system, immigrants arriving during this period were highly educated elites from countries including Egypt, Iraq, and Syria."
Suggested revision: eliminate these lines and replace with research-backed sentences such as the one from migrationpolicy.org
