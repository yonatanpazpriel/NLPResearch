From: Daniel Thompson Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 2:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies curriculum
To Whom It May Concern.
I request that the current version of the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum be revised to make it more balanced. The current proposed curriculum marginalizes students who have an objection to the biased viewpoint of the curriculum. The curriculum is biased in the way it refers students to organizations that have a leftist slant such as the Black Panthers Party or the Third World Liberation Front. The proposed curriculum needs to have a balanced viewpoint and give the students information from both sides so they can made an informed decision. Not just indoctrinate them. Even the New York Times Editorial Board thinks the proposed curriculum needs and overhaul. Thank you. Daniel Thompson
