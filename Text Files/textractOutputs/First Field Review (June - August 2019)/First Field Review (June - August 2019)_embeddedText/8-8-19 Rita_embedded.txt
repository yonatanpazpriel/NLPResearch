Page 13, Line 4. Capitalism is described along with white supremacy, racism, ets as a form of oppression. Capitalism is the only item in the list that is a form of market system. As such it is erroneously singled out as a market system making the statement, not only incorrect, but highly political. There is no mention of fascism, communism, or socialism as oppressive market-governmental systems. History is rife with examples of torture and oppression of people under these other market -government systems. Among these systems only capitalism provides the potential and motivation for success for those who are less fortunate. To teach otherwise simply puts students in a victim position where motivation is removed and reliance on the state is perpetuated. Although this only serves as a guide many teachers will use it as such without modification for lack of time or worse will see these statements as state approval to push their political agenda onto students without accurate information from other perspectives.
