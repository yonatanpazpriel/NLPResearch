I think the idea of teaching children to get along & the basic idea that people of all ethnicities are Human & worthy of respect is an admirable goal. However I am very upset by the current draft that teaches some cultures are better than others & some cultures that the authors do not like should be eliminated. This "politically correct" version supplied by anti-israeli professors is NOT what will achieve this goal. As a Californian & American citizen I demand that our children are not taught the hateful rhetoric currently offered. Please revise it!
Thank you for considering this serious topic.
