Drop all social justice gender identity nonsense and focus on teaching kids how to read, use math, teach 1960s world History and US History as well with sections of History with each decade from 1960 onward followed by proper public civics as taught in the 1950s and not the lies/garbage you teach today. Let parents guide your curriculum and let them decide what needs to be taught outside of the basics.
Refusal to take these steps will result in citizens who are ill informed and will cut your throat in your old age if you don't teach them properly. You have a limited amount of time in each school year with so much happening in the world today you don't have have the time to play around with "Experiments." BTW You'll never touch mine again, my family is not dependent on public garbage bin schools and lies and we are trained to protect ourselves from the evil your department, run by filthy democrats, propagates.
Hopefully the future is promising by moving to National Voter ID to remove public officials who gained office through election fraud, which will allow us to remove officials in state government that are anti citizen and pro illegal alien.
