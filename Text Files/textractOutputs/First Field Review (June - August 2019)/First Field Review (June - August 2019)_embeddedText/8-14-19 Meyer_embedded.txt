Having 2 young kids in elementary school it scares me to think they wouldn't learn about such antisemitism especially with what is going on in the world today. It is scary for me when I meet younger generations who either don't believe in or haven't heard about the holocaust. Ethnic studies should highlight the cultures about which they speak, not fall into the same stereotypic tropes that caused the deaths of millions. Though we are small in the world we have a number of Jews in California and New York.
The holocaust is a lesson for us all. Please include it and remove blame and stereotypes of any group. History repeats itself more often than we think. Genocide is happening all over the world. There are enough countries on the world that are holocaust deniers and blame this small minority for their woes in classroom settings. Please don't allow this horrific classroom plan to plague our school system.
By pitting people against one another, you are just asking for more bullying.
Thank you for your consideration.
