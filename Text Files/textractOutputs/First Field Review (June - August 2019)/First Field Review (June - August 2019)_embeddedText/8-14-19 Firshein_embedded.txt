From: Steven Firshein Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 6:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethnic studies problem
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am concerned by the unbalanced Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. While I think its a reasonable idea to increase the awareness of the challenges of various ethnic groups as they attempt (hopefully and successfully) to integrate into american society and values, its counterproductive to largely leave out both the challenges and success the Jewish community have encountered. I didnt see information on discrimination and general anti semitism mentioned in these ethnic teachings even though to my understanding more that half of all hate crimes are directed against Jews
I ask you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. sincerely Steven Firshein DMD
