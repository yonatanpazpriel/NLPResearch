Hi. My name is Guy Levanon and I have two children in California's public schools: Hannah and Elijah, and I am very concerned with the recent ESMC proposal. I write this email to request to either reject it or massively revise it consistent with the recommendations from the California
Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others
The proposal has a clear pro-Palestinian biased perspective on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as well as not covering the recent significant rise of anti-semitism in the US. Examples of a strong bias in the coverage of the Israel-Palenstian conflict is that the highly controversial BDS movement is covered without mentioning that its stated purpose is to weaken Israel to a point where there is no viable State of Israel (stated several times but some of its leaders), and without mentioning that the US congress recently passed overwhelmingly several resolutions against it and 26 states have passed laws penalizing companies that choose to boycott Israel. This clear stand by the majority of states and by the US congress should be mentioned next to the BDS coverage.
Regarding anti-semitism, the proposal does not cover the very sharp rise in hate crimes against Jews in the US and in Europe. See for example this NY Times article that says that in 2018 two thirds of hate crimes were antisemitic in nature: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/nyregion/anti-semitism-brooklyn-new-york.html.
I am very concerned that this curriculum will present a hostile environment for my kids where as an Israeli-American family, they will be ridiculed at school. Instead of helping foster tolerance, I think this proposal will do the opposite. In addition, it will present a distorted perspective to the next generation of Americans.
Sincerely,
Guy Levanon
