Why are we wasting time writing and reading emails? You know the BDS sponsored curriculum is based on lies and misinformation. I think you know that the Palestinians' worst enemies are their leaders and their "sympathizers" outside of the area...leaders who are corrupt, divert resources for their own benefit, teach hatred in the schools rather than how to be a successful adult, hide weapons in schools and use children for their dirty work, have never entered into nation building and sympathizers who, by allowing the leaders to do their thing doom the average Palestinian to a miserable life. So why are we wasting our time. DO YOUR JOB. TEACH THE TRUTH.
