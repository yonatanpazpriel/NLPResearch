Dear Sir I understand that you are introducing a curriculum for the schools that presents Israel as Islamic Phobic and apartheid and against Arabs and Muslims. Nothing can be further from the truth. All of the "wars" were begun by Arab neighboring countries. Israel would like to live in peace with them. The truth is that in the neighboring Arab countries there are no "Jewish Communities " because they are not allowed. Israel is the only true democracy in the area. All its citizens have full rights. The Arab population in Israel proper has made it clear that id an Arab "Palestinian" State will be set up they would still prefer to live in Israel. The battle against Israel is a battle of anti-Semitism. It is the anti Semitism that should be condemned. The goal of the Palistinean People is to eliminate Israel as a Nation. That is what they teach their children. It is clear from history that Israel was a Jewish Nation before the rise of Islam. Jerusalem was a "Jewish City'. Islam conquered it because they wanted to show that they were the "true" religion. Under Muslim control only Muslim's were allowed to pray there. Under Israeli control all religions cam pray there. You are doing a great disservice to your educational system by introducing a one sided "political issue" that teaches lies. I would be happy to review any of the facts with you so that the truth can be "learned" Dr. Joseph Leibowitz Phd
