The ethnic studies curriculum states as its goal to encourage cultural understanding and then sets up specific studies that do not represent both sides of an issue or that create unsubstantiated links as in Palestine-Mexico as similar.
The curriculum does not appear to have much to say about oppression of the Jewish people, historical prejudice, anti-semitism

So, one possibility would be to build a world in which understanding and empathy based on `walking a few steps in another's shoes' develops from students being presented with the value of multiple cultures and perspectives. Is that happening in this curriculum? It appears to have a bias, to not embrace everyone as having value.

My current understanding of the ethnic studies curriculum is that there is an agenda, that the view of oppressed peoples and cultures is a biased one, that both sides are not represented, that there seems to be no goal of building understanding to promote peace and well being but instead seems created to create distrust and promote stereotypes that have contributed to the persecution of certain cultures
