Comment: Despite the significant contributions of Jews to California's history, politics, culture, and government � and our community's longstanding struggle against hatred and discrimination � the ESMC erases the Jewish experience. The exclusion is offensive and inconsistent with the purpose of ethnic studies to promote inclusion and tolerance. � This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses.

� The ESMC omits antisemitism.

� This is also inconsistent with, and in contrast to, the attention it devotes to Islamophobia. The most recent available FBI statistics record 938 antisemitic incidents and 273 Islamophobic incidents.

� The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews.
� The curriculum supports the antisemitic BDS movement.
