Line 923 and all of African American Studies Outline- This outline gives no background as to the positive steps initiated by the US population and government to improve the situation of Black Americans from the time of the Civil War to now. From the late 1960's until now has had a tremendous improvements in attitude, and acceptance. Yes there is a ways to go, but recognition of the efforts made by many in the US would paint a less biased picture. This curriculum needs to cover the fact that "white" individuals are subject to many of the same grievances as people of color. Such items would include ethnic discrimination, economic discrimination, class distinction, etc .
