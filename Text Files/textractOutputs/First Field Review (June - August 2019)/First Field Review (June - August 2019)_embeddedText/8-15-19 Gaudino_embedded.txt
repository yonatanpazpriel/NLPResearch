Do you recognize the statewide disaster: Millions of teens are at risk to ignorance of our landscape ad people.
The HSS framework for 8th grade is confusing failure!
We must add basic knowledge to 7-8th grades to guarantee basic knowledge of our natural and human systems. We now are trying to have political goals become the scientific facts.
Failed leadership is shown by those who make the cheap shots of racism and bias "white, black" and "left" or rightwing. Ethnic studies serves to document the North American perspective and US history of our ancestors.
You will be conditioned as we grow this purpose: to fix the disaster , boost the USA PROUD LEARNING call-to-action, and fix the problem to improve teaching our history.
