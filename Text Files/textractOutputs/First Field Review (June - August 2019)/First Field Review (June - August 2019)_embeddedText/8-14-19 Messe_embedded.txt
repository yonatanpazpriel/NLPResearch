From: David Messe Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 2:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies
Dear CDE, IQC, and State Board of Education, In response to your call for public comment on the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, I am submitting the following input: Helping students appreciate diversity and educating them about different forms of racism and hate is a deeply worthy goal. That is why I am profoundly disappointed that the Draft 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum excludes the Jewish community, omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry, and openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel.
I strongly urge you to remove anti-Semitic stereotypes, BDS, and all anti-Israel bias from the curriculum. Furthermore, I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others. Thank you for your time and consideration. Sincerely, David Messe Oak Park, CA
