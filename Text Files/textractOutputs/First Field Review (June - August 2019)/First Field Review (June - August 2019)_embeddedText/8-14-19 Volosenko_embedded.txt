Guiding Principles and Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching Anna Volosenko, RN, BSN, parent Comment
In response to these quotes from this section of the document: "critique empire and its relationship to white supremacy, racism, patriarchy, cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, ableism, anthropocentrism, and other forms of power and oppression at the intersections of our society;....challenge imperialist/colonial hegemonic beliefs and practices on the ideological, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized levels;6. connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels to ensure a truer democracy...".
I would like to say that this country has been very successful as compared to many other countries. I believe that, rather than promote a spirit of `challenging' and `critiquing' our government, it's important to compare and contrast how, even though certain mistakes might have been made in the past, this government was still able to learn from mistakes and become a powerful nation. In addition, it's unnecessary to have children `connect...to resistance movements'. I believe that it's 100% ok to support one's government rather than resist authority.

Comment in response to: " ...education inequality and the opportunity gap that gets students to reflect upon the many factors that have contributed to disproportionate student success across racial and class lines. Methods. Inquiry...theorize solutions to problems created by centuries of settler colonialism, imperialism, and white supremacy"
This `white supremacy' was what gave so many immigrants the opportunity to come to a great country, escape religious persecution, and actually break through the "opportunity gap" by working hard and getting an education/career! My family immigrated to the United States when I was 3 years old. We left the former Soviet Union in search of religious freedom and opportunities that were impossible in a communist regime. Was it difficult when my family was first starting out? Of course! But, thanks to capitalism and the American dream, (even though there was `educational inequality' due to where we could afford to live) all 6 children in my family were able to get a good education. We now have nurses, police officers, medical assistant, and an infrasound technician in the family. I believe that, rather than teach our children that the government should provide `equality' for all, Americans need to work hard in order to provide for

their own future. By using language such as `white supremacy' and `inequality', the connotations of which make one feel that someone else needs to fix an individual's problems, I believe that these ethnics lessons are not allowing for proper critical analysis of all sides of the issue. "General" comment
In general, I agree that we need to be culturally aware of different ethnicities around us, especially living in such a diverse metropolitan area such as California. However, I also believe that we should not oppress the ideals of the great country in which we live. In teaching about other ethnicities, we must not forget the people that fought for our (American) independence. Thank you for your time and consideration of my thoughts.
