Dear Committee and all concerned, I believe that with the proposed ethnic studies curriculum, there are
errors and omissions that need to be addressed. Do you know that in the world today there are 56 Muslim countries, 22 of these are Arab? And that Israel, the size of New Jersey, is the world's ONLY sovereign Jewish country in the world? Do you plan to teach about the 800,000 Jews who were persecuted and forced to flee Arab countries, leaving everything behind? Do you plan to include in the curriculum the fact, that the Jewish people are INDIGINOUS to the land of Israel? That the Jewish people are called Jews because they came from Judea? Since you are planning to cover the history of Arab immigration to America, I urge you to read my article about Arab immigration to what is now Israel published in the Middle East Quarterly, "Were the Arabs Indigenous to Mandatory Palestine?" by Sheree Roth Middle East Quarterly

The Arab narrative about the Israel-Arab conflict may be compelling but it contradicts history, archeology, and even the oldest history books on earth which are the bibles in every Jewish synagogue and Christian church in the world. The Koran does not mention Jerusalem even once. Arab propaganda in this country and around the world, is bought and paid for by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. It is already widespread in our colleges and the media. Sights are now being set on high schools and even elementary schools. Please do not allow Arab propaganda into our California school curriculum.
