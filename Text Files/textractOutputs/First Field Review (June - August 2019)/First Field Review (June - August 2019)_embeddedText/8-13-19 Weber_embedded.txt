I have read and reread the materials related to the newly proposed ethnic studies model curriculum and have a multitude of reactions. While I fully endorse the importance of including ethnic studies--an exploration of the ethnic diversity of our country, what it means, issues of power and inequality, etc., I am very concerned about several aspects of this curriculum.
First of all, from my reading, you have defined the multi-ethnic experience as primarily (perhaps exclusively) one of victimization. And while the issues of power and inequality need to be explored, the tenor of this document seems balanced more toward an ideological rather than educational point of view. Because of the orientation, it does not fulfill what I consider one of the most important aspects of education: providing information for debate, exploration of agreement and differences, rigorous conversation. It seems to me that this curriculum requires students to buy into the key premise of victimization and that all conversation will flow from that premise.

Second, I am stunned at this particular moment in history, when antisemitism is clearly on the rise, that antisemitism is not noted anywhere in the glossary or curriculum. I am part of a Muslim-Jewish dialogue group : it was notable, when we were discussing what each member had learned the preceding year, that several Muslim members commented that they always thought of Jews as a majority culture, part of the `Judeo-Christian culture' and hadn't realized the history of oppression, antisemitism, redlining, exclusion from schools/universities, hotels, private clubs that was prevalent in this country and now understand the importance of understanding and responding to the increasing acts of verbal and violence-related antisemitism in America. How is it possible that this is not a part of the curriculum? It's truly inconceivable to me.
I am aware this is a draft of the proposed curriculum but hope that means that there will be serious discussion and revision as you proceed. I would far prefer my children and grandchildren be trained to not only understand the issues and challenges of ethnic (dare I say racial, since this appears in your glossary to only be a `social construct'?) identity but to learn the tools for civil discourse in ethnically, racially and religiously diverse settings about these issues rather than having being compelled to sit through a course pushing ideology as a replacement for serious learning.
