From: RalphRabkin Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 3:42 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am alarmed by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I support the idea of teaching an ethni c studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, St and With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others that have contacted you.
I should note that while I support diversity and inclusion, I strongly oppose a curriculum that "erases Am erican Jewish experience, fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singl es out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools
Accordingly I respectfully ask that you make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Ralph Rabkin, MD. Emeritus Professor Medicine, Stanford University Palo Alto, California
