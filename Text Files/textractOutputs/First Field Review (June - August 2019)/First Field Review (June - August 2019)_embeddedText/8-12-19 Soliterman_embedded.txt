Hello there!
As a Jewish Californian and a father of two, I am very concerned with this proposed curriculum that, in my opinion, unfairly presents a pure anti-Israel point of view. An ethnic study course must represent all points of view fairly.
The political situation in Israel is far from simple and it's preposterous to just paint it black and white. If California educators are in business of bringing up a well rounded and well informed generation of independent thinkers - which is the best that any education can do for a particular person specifically and for the whole society in general - they need to review the curriculum in question and work with Jewish scholars and educators to FAIRLY REPRESENT the Jewish side in this story!
