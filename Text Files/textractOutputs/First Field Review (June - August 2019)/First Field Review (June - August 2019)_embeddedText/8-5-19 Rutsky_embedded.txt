This entire curriculum needs serious revision as a father of 4 Jewish children, I am respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I fear for my children's safety if this curriculum is adopted and taught as defined in the proposal, and it may force me to pull my children from public schools and possibly even leave the state.

This inclusion is prejudicial and biased against one country, Israel, and one minority religious group, Israel. It is one sided and as explained below even dangerous and does not represent history or the current situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine accurately, fairly in in any semblance of a balanced approach.

For example, Page 2 of 22 of the glossary of the proposal, Glossarybilbiographyesmc falsely characterizes the BDS Movement as a freedom from Apartheid by the state of Israel. This is not only one sided and false, it takes a political side in a very complex problem and is NOT fair or balanced, and will create hate and possible violence against Jewish students and families.

Specifically, Pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269 of the sample lesson plans, SampleCourseModelsEsmc, is also prejudicial against Israel and by direct inference the rights of the Jewish people to their own self determination.
This document encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242)., again heavily biased against the Jewish State. In fact, this is inaccurate historically, one sided, and heavily biased
Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism."

Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. In addition, it presents the whole of the middle east and the situation in Israel and Palestine as a fault of the Jewish state. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum, and the demonization of the Jewish state, is deeply disappointing. If allowed in the curriculum in this way it will,and as many Jewish leaders predict, make life dangerous for Jews in California.
