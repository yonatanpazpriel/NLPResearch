Glossary page 2, regarding capitalism, glossary page 8, regarding "hxrstory", and everything in document: This whole document is nothing more than a radical left-wing propaganda tool sold as an educational tool, when it is just another form of indoctrination being forced on California schools. This biased is clear in the glossary's defining of capitalism in that it goes beyond defining capitalism and unfairly claims it is a detriment for those of color. This bias is also seen in the glossary's inclusion of "hxrstory", "hxrstrory" is not a real word, it is a word created by a left wing radical to spout a radical left talking point.

In conclusion, The California Department of Education should be interested in teaching its students real life skills and unbiased information and allow them to formulate their own political interpretations and feelings toward school subjects. This document sample of proposed educational material is proof that the California Department of Education is more concerned with indoctrination rather than educating the populace. No wonder California children can barely read or perform simple arithmetic and are falling far behind other states. Provide real education, not this far-left garbage.
