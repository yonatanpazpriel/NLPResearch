Hello, As a residence of the Silicon Valley, as a Israeli who helps developing new technologies to make a better world, as a parent that educated his children that we are all the same, that we all should be tolerant towards other cultures...as a person who lives here and tries her best to be as everyone else, I find it hard o understand the new proposed curriculum to schools across CA! Is that the way to educate tolerant? by teaching how to BDS Israel? By teaching them to hate Israelis? do you take into consideration the influence it will have on our children? My kids elementary school and high school already cleaned 2 swastikas of their schools' walls and this is before the school year has began! IMAGINE!!!!!
Please! Please! Reconsider this twisted and biased curriculum against Israel! Don't teach how to hate us.
The future of our children is in you hands and on your head!
