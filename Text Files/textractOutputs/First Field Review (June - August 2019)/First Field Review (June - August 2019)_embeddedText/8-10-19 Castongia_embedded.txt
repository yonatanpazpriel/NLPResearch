I read through the curriculum and have concerns and would like to see the bias taken out of this curriculum. How can our students think critically when their is propaganda and bias put into this model. We are doing our students and our country a great disservice by only teaching parts of our ethnic history. The Jewish nation and Israel are completely left out and marginalized. This curriculum is unacceptable and shows capitalism as an evil way to build our nation. I do not believe brainwashing the next generation by a prescribed curriculum is what the CDE should be doing. Yet, another attempt to rewrite history and dumb down our students.
