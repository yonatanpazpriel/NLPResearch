Having observed some of the deliberation of the committee, we found that the group did a wonderful job of inviting so many perspectives into the room and working with what they received. We commend the advisory committee and curriculum writers for their patience throughout this difficult and tiresome process. The tasks set for this committee are made nearly impossible to complete in such a short amount of time (six days). In addition, I observe that the work being done to include every person, every social movement, and every vocab word is nearly impossible. The work to include everyone and everything (this framework of inclusion) is purposely made impossible so that folks obsess over who and what might be forgotten. The model is written in such a way that it protects and supports ethnic studies teachers and, in some cases, may be the only ones in their district implementing the program. The document provides room for participatory learning and instruction and the inclusion of resources and perspectives not contained in the document. The Filipino American National Historical Society supports the approval of the document without delay.
