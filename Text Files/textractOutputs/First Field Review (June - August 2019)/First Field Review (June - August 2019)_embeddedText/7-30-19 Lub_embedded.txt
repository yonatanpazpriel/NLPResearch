From: Sebastian Lub Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 1:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Model Curriculum
To those who seek to indoctrinate rather than educate our children:
This "model" curriculum is disgraceful and those who are presenting it for implementation know it. The use of non-words like hxstory is designed to confuse students and sow discord in their minds. I am appalled at this brazen attempt to make our children hate the society in which they live so they will be motivated to destroy it. That clearly is the desired end of its writers.
California's per-pupil spending is nearly the highest in the world, yet our children are poorly educated. This is confirmed at the register of any retail outlet you can name.
Teach our children to read. Teach them to write. Teach them arithmetic. Trust that with those skills mastered they will have the tools to do well for themselves in our society as it is and will work to change it for the better in the future.
Show that you truly care for our children and put a stop to this cynical program of reeducation.
