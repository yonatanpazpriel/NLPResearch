General Comment: My husband and I are very concerned about what we feel is indoctrination of school kids (and really no better than what occurred during Nazi Germany). To imply that Capitalism is racist is ridiculous and wrong. I'm sure the Socialist Party of America is for this new curriculum and we denounce it and hope the powers that be see through this ridiculous indoctrination of California/America's children and teens. This should not even be considered in our opinions. It's a complete waste of our hard earned tax dollars to spend even one minute of time considering this as a viable curriculum for California kids. Thanks, Gary and Kelli Reagan
