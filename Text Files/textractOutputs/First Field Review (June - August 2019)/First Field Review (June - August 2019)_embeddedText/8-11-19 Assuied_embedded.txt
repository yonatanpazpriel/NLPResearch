To whom it may concern, I agree that ethnic studies is a critical part of education and should be included in California curriculum. However, the proposed curriculum in its current form is in serious need of an overhaul. Let's create curriculum that encourages open-minded thinking and discussions, not one that tells students how to think.
The proposed curriculum on Arab Studies is one-sided and does not include a Jewish/Israeli perspective. In trying to broaden perspective, this one-sided argument unfortunately serves to marginalize Jewish people and our history. There are many Jews from the Middle East (my extended family among them) who would have different perspectives and these voices deserve to be heard too. I don't see any Jewish organizations (and there are many progressive ones, that also include history of Jews Indigenous to the Middle East) in consulted lists.
It is imperative that our children learn history that includes multiple perspectives. Please revamp this curriculum and invite a diversity of voices to the table.
Best regards, Vanya Assuied
