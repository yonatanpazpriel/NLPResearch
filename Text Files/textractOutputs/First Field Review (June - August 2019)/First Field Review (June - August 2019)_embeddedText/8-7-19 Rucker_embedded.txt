Having now read this document, there is no mention of the plight of the Jews as an ethnic group during the course of their history. No mention of being exiled from Europe( Holocaust), Spain(Spanish Inquisition), the Middle East ie: Iraq (1950's-1960's), Iran(1970's), Soviet Union (1960's), etc. If you are teaching about Ethnicity then there needs to be added lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group. This curriculum is very one sided and equally racist which is what you are trying to eliminate. Pg. 2 of this document as well as pages 234, 237, 242, 256 & 264-269
