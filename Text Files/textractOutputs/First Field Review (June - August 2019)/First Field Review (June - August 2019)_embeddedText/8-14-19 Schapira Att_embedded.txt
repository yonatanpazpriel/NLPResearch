Executive Summary Hate Crime In California
2018
Hate Crime in California 2018 presents statistics on hate crimes reported by California law enforcement agencies that occurred during 2018 with prior years included for context. These statistics include the number of hate crime events�, hate crime offenses�, victims of hate crimes, and suspects of hate crimes. This report also provides statistics reported by district and elected city attorneys on the number of hate crime cases referred to prosecutors, the number of cases filed in court, and the disposition of those cases.
The total number of hate crime events, offenses, and victims decreased while the total number of suspects increased in 2018. The following statements highlight the major trends in Hate Crime in California for 2018.
Crime Data
The amount of hate crime events has gone up and down over the last decade. In the last 10 years, hate crime events have decreased by 3.1 percent (Table 11). The lowest year for reported hate crime events was 2014 with 758 events (Table 11).
Hate crime events decreased 2.5 percent from 1,093 in 2017 to 1,066 in 2018. (Table 11)
The number of victims of reported hate crimes decreased 2.6 percent from 1,270 in 2017 to 1,237 in 2018. (Table 15)
The number of suspects of reported hate crimes increased 7.9 percent from 1,013 in 2017 to 1,093 in 2018. (Table 15)
Hate crime events involving a racial bias overall decreased 1.3 percent from 602 in 2017 to 594 in 2018. (Table 11)
� Anti-black or African American bias events fell from 302 in 2017 to 276 in 2018, a decrease of 8.6 percent.
� Anti-Hispanic or Latino bias events rose from 126 in 2017 to 149 in 2018, an increase of 18.3 percent.
Hate crime events involving a religion bias decreased 2.9 percent from 207 in 2017 to 201 in 2018. (Table 11)
� Anti-Jewish bias events rose from 104 in 2017 to 126 in 2018, an increase of 21.2 percent. � Anti-Islamic (Muslim) bias events fell from 46 in 2017 to 28 in 2018.
Hate crime events involving a sexual orientation bias decreased 3.3 percent from 246 in 2017 to 238 in 2018. (Table 11)
� Anti-gay (male) bias events fell from 172 in 2017 to 169 in 2018, a decrease of 1.7 percent.
Hate crime offenses decreased 3.6 percent from 1,315 in 2017 to 1,268 in 2018. (Table 12) � Violent crime offenses decreased 2.6 percent from 860 in 2017 to 838 in 2018. (Table 13) � Property crime offenses decreased 5.5 percent from 451 in 2017 to 426 in 2018. (Table 13)

Prosecutorial Data
Of the 425 hate crimes that were referred for prosecution, 314 cases were filed by district attorneys and elected city attorneys for prosecution. Of the 314 cases that were filed for prosecution, 228 were filed as hate crimes and 86 were filed as non-bias motivated crimes. (Table 7A) Of the 103 cases with a disposition available for this report:
� 65.0 percent (67) were hate crime convictions; � 32.0 percent (33) were other convictions; and � 2.9 percent (3) were not convicted. (Table 7B)
1 The term event is defined as an occurrence when a hate crime is involved. (In this report, the information about the event is a crime report or source document that meets the criteria for a hate crime.) There may be one or more suspects involved, one or more victims targeted, and one or more offenses involved for each event.
2 The term offense is defined as criminal acts that are recorded as follows: murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, simple assault, intimidation, and destruction/vandalism as defined in the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) and the national Hate Crimes Statistics Report.

Understanding the Data
Crime Data
Local law enforcement agencies are required to report hate crimes to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in compliance with California Penal Code Section 13023. California Penal Code Section 422.55 defines a hate crime as "a criminal act committed, in whole or in part, because of one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3) nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics."
The following information and limitations should be considered when using hate crime data:
1) A hate crime event contains the occurrence of one or more criminal offenses, committed against one or more victims, by one or more suspects or perpetrators. Victims can have more than one offense committed against them.
2) Hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies are counted in a specific way. In each hate crime event, the DOJ counts the total number of victims, the total number of suspects, and the total number of criminal offenses in one event. These totals are then classified and counted by type of bias motivation (e.g., anti-black or African American, anti-Hispanic or Latino, anti-Jewish, anti-gay, etc.), type of crime (e.g., murder, aggravated assault, burglary, destruction/vandalism, etc.), the location where the crime took place (e.g., residence, street, synagogue, school, etc.), and the type of victim (e.g., individual, property, etc.).
3) The DOJ requested that each law enforcement agency establish procedures incorporating a twotier review (decision-making) process. The first level is done by the initial officer who responds to the suspected hate crime incident. At the second level, each report is reviewed by at least one other officer to confirm that the event was, in fact, a hate crime.
4) Caution should be used when making jurisdictional comparisons. The following factors should be considered: cultural diversity and population density; size of law enforcement agencies; and the training received in the identification of hate crimes by law enforcement officers in each jurisdiction.
5) The following factors may influence the volume of hate crimes reported to the DOJ: � Cultural practices of individuals and their likeliness to report hate crimes to law enforcement agencies. � Strength and investigative emphasis of law enforcement agencies. � Policies of law enforcement agencies. � Community policing policies.

6) In 2009, the DOJ began collecting information on hate crimes involving multiple-bias motivations. Law enforcement agencies were able to report up to five bias motivations for each hate-related event, as long as there was a unique offense for each bias motivation. In 2011, the DOJ expanded the acceptable location codes for the California hate crime data collection system to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2013, the DOJ expanded the gender bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include gender non-conforming in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2014, the DOJ expanded the religion bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include Sikh in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2015, the DOJ expanded the race and ethnicity bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level.
7) There is a significant disparity between the number of individual and entity victims that stems from the DOJ's Criminal Justice Statistics Center's use of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program standards. A property crime against an entity (a business, religious organization, government institution, etc.) can only be counted as one victim, whereas a crime committed against an individual can have more than one victim counted per crime event.
8) In 2013, the FBI's UCR program revised the definition of "forcible rape" (the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will) to "rape," which is now defined as "penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The California DOJ implemented this definition change in January 2014.

County District Attorney and Elected City Attorney Prosecutorial Data
The following information and limitations should be considered when interpreting hate crime cases: 1) In order to show the criminal justice system's response to hate crimes, in 1995 the Attorney
General asked all district attorneys and elected city attorneys to submit summary data of complaints filed and convictions secured. 2) The 2018 District Attorney's and Elected City Attorney's Report File of Hate Crime Cases contains summary data based on cases referred to each district attorney or elected city attorney, and filings and convictions that occurred from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018. 3) When viewing prosecutorial data, it is not possible to relate the number of hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies to the number of hate crimes prosecuted by district attorneys and city attorneys. First, crimes often occur in different reporting years than their subsequent prosecutions. Second, the number of crimes reported by law enforcement is much higher than those calling for prosecutorial action since the latter requires an arrested defendant who can be prosecuted in a court of law. 4) The annual prosecutorial report collects data on the total number of hate crime cases filed and the total number of hate crime convictions. There is no direct relationship between "complaints filed" and "convictions" since a case may be filed in one year and the outcome (trial or pleading) may occur in another. 5) All prosecutorial data includes hate crimes committed by both juvenile and adult defendants. 6) Glenn County District Attorney did not report data for 2014.

Notes: Percentages may not add to 100.0 because of rounding. Crimes committed against property (e.g., a business, government institution, religious organization, etc.) can only be counted as one victim, whereas a crime committed against an individual can have more than one victim per event. For a more complete definition of each term, please refer to Appendix 2.

Notes: Hate Crime Prosecution Survey is conducted by the Criminal Justice Statistics Center in January following the reporting year.
The number of complaints filed by county district attorneys and elected city attorneys or the number of cases that resulted in hate crime convictions cannot be linked to the number of hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies. Dash indicates that percent changes are not calculated when the base number is less than 50. a Glenn County District Attorney did not report data for 2014.

Notes: Percentages may not add to subtotals or 100.0 because of rounding.
Dash indicates that percent changes are not calculated when the base number is less than 50, or that no data were reported. 1 Reporting of anti-Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander began in 2015. 2 Data does not match previously published reports due to the separation of anti-Arab bias type from anti-other ethnicity/national origin bias type. 3 Reporting of anti-Sikh bias motivation began in 2014.
4 Reporting of anti-gender non-conforming bias motivation began in 2013.

Notes: Percentages may not add to subtotals or 100.0 because of rounding.
Dash indicates that percent changes are not calculated when the base number is less than 50, or that no data were reported. 1 Reporting of anti-Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander began in 2015. 2 Data does not match previously published reports due to the separation of anti-Arab bias type from anti-other ethnicity/national origin bias type. 3 Reporting of anti-Sikh bias motivation began in 2014.
4 Reporting of anti-gender non-conforming bias motivation began in 2013.

Appendix 1: Data Characteristics and Known Limitations
Crime Data
Local law enforcement agencies are required to report hate crimes to the Department of Justice (DOJ) in compliance with California Penal Code Section 13023. California Penal Code Section 422.55 defines a hate crime as "a criminal act committed, in whole or in part, because of one or more of the following actual or perceived characteristics of the victim: (1) disability, (2) gender, (3) nationality, (4) race or ethnicity, (5) religion, (6) sexual orientation, (7) association with a person or group with one or more of these actual or perceived characteristics."
The following information and limitations should be considered when using hate crime data:
1) A hate crime event contains the occurrence of one or more criminal offenses, committed against one or more victims, by one or more suspects or perpetrators. Victims can have more than one offense committed against them.
2) Hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies are counted in a specific way. In each hate crime event, the DOJ counts the total number of victims, the total number of suspects, and the total number of criminal offenses in one event. These totals are then classified and counted by type of bias motivation (e.g., anti-black or African American, anti-Hispanic or Latino, anti-Jewish, anti-gay, etc.), type of crime (e.g., murder, aggravated assault, burglary, destruction/vandalism, etc.), the location where the crime took place (e.g., residence, street, synagogue, school, etc.), and the type of victim (e.g., individual, property, etc.).
3) The DOJ requested that each law enforcement agency establish procedures incorporating a twotier review (decision-making) process. The first level is done by the initial officer who responds to the suspected hate crime incident. At the second level, each report is reviewed by at least one other officer to confirm that the event was, in fact, a hate crime.
4) Caution should be used when making jurisdictional comparisons. The following factors should be considered: cultural diversity and population density; size of law enforcement agencies; and the training received in the identification of hate crimes by law enforcement officers in each jurisdiction.
5) The following factors may influence the volume of hate crimes reported to the DOJ: � Cultural practices of individuals and their likeliness to report hate crimes to law enforcement agencies. � Strength and investigative emphasis of law enforcement agencies. � Policies of law enforcement agencies. � Community policing policies.
Hate Crime In California 33

6) In 2009, the DOJ began collecting information on hate crimes involving multiple-bias motivations. Law enforcement agencies were able to report up to five bias motivations for each hate-related event, as long as there was a unique offense for each bias motivation. In 2011, the DOJ expanded the acceptable location codes for the California hate crime data collection system to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2013, the DOJ expanded the gender bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include gender non-conforming in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2014, the DOJ expanded the religion bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include Sikh in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level. In 2015, the DOJ expanded the race and ethnicity bias for the California hate crime data collection system to include Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander in order to reflect modifications implemented at the national level.
7) There is a significant disparity between the number of individual and entity victims that stems from the DOJ's Criminal Justice Statistics Center's use of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program standards. A property crime against an entity (a business, religious organization, government institution, etc.) can only be counted as one victim, whereas a crime committed against an individual can have more than one victim counted per crime event.
8) In 2013, the FBI's UCR program revised the definition of "forcible rape" (the carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will) to "rape," which is now defined as "penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The California DOJ implemented this definition change in January 2014.

County District Attorney and Elected City Attorney Prosecutorial Data
The following information and limitations should be considered when interpreting hate crime cases: 1) In order to show the criminal justice system's response to hate crimes, in 1995 the Attorney
General asked all district attorneys and elected city attorneys to submit summary data of complaints filed and convictions secured. 2) The 2018 District Attorney's and Elected City Attorney's Report File of Hate Crime Cases contains summary data based on cases referred to each district attorney or elected city attorney, and filings and convictions that occurred from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018. 3) When viewing prosecutorial data, it is not possible to relate the number of hate crimes reported by law enforcement agencies to the number of hate crimes prosecuted by district attorneys and city attorneys. First, crimes often occur in different reporting years than their subsequent prosecutions. Second, the number of crimes reported by law enforcement is much higher than those calling for prosecutorial action since the latter requires an arrested defendant who can be prosecuted in a court of law. 4) The annual prosecutorial report collects data on the total number of hate crime cases filed and the total number of hate crime convictions. There is no direct relationship between "complaints filed" and "convictions" since a case may be filed in one year and the outcome (trial or pleading) may occur in another. 5) All prosecutorial data includes hate crimes committed by both juvenile and adult defendants. 6) Glenn County District Attorney did not report data for 2014.
