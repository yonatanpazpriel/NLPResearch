As proposed, the curriculum is blatantly anti-Israel and anti-Semitic, with barely any references to some of history's worst examples of religious and ethnic hatred. Why isn't the Holocaust discussed in any detail, why aren't recent attacks against Jews, both here in California and in other parts of the country mentioned? Why is Israel singled out when Myanamar, China, Saudi Arabia, to mention only a few, have policies discriminating, imprisoning, or murdering against religious and ethnic groups?
I respectfully urge you to reject the curriculum as proposed and rewrite it to provide equal coverage and discussion, pro and con, to all ethnic, religious, and cultural groups.
