Certainly, we should be teaching our young people the values of diversity, so we applaud your ethnic studies guidelines, however, there are some serious omissions and commissions that have to be addressed, to wit:
All forms of prejudice are spelled out, EXCEPT that of Anti-Semitism. Why? It must be included, especially now, since there has been a surge of anti-semitic acts in the United States and abroad. Islamophobia is attended to, but in the latest FBI statistics, there were 938 antiSemitic incidents versus 273 Islamophobic ones. All the more reason that anti-Semitism must be mentioned.
The curriculum supports the anti-Semitic BDS movement which is a policy originated to deny the presence of Israel in its ancestral homeland, and to eliminate it. Israel has many Palestinian members in its parliaments, in it jurisprudence system and in its Supreme court. Those factors must be taken into consideration when considering the tendentious spirit of the BDS movement. Shouldn't their supporters be condemning the racial behavior in China, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Sudan, and in many other parts of the world? Their focus on Israel only is suspicious. Isolating Israel is an attempt to deny its legitimacy, and so the curriculum must, if it is to remain true to its promise, to expose the rationale behind the apparent condemnation of Israel inherent in the proposed curriculum.
At line 5157-5163, the ESMC adopts the Palestinian narrative of the founding of the Third Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine in 1947-1948, but it must consider that, simultaneously that there were 800,000 Jews expelled at the same time from Arab countries. Fleeing to Israel for protection, they did not remain refugees for 71 years as the Palestinians have, but created a thriving, enlightened democracy.
Line 6008 promotes the Council on American/Islamic Relations, but it was an unindicted co-consiprator in the Holy Land Terrorist financing trial. Why? And its programs are strongly anti-Israel.
Lines 6010-6181 focuses on Islamophobia, as well it should, yet does not discuss ANTISemitism. WHY?
Lines 5792-5820 include a rap song which calls states, "Free Palestine." If you check the Palestinian textbooks in the West Bank, you'll find clear evidence that "Palestine" eliminates Israel altogether, and describes "Palestine" as a singular state from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean.

Is this what you want to include in your curriculum?? The Nazis eliminated Jewish businesses, industries, shops, the professional class��that was an extended BDS movement that must not be promoted by our schools.
Please reconsider your curriculum��it's an imperative!
