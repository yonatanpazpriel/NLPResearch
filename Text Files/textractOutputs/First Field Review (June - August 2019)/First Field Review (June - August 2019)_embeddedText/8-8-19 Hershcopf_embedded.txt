From: Eve Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 12:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Support for Ethnic Studies
As a concerned member of the Jewish community I support Ethnic Studies in California public high schools, including curriculum that the Arab American community believes to be important. It is critical that students learn about issues of race, class and gender. The benefits of Ethnic Studies have been well documented including better student academic performance, and higher graduation and college enrollment rates.
