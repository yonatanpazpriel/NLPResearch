1. The suggestions about BDS reflect the viewpoint of the Arab side in the current Israeli/Palestinian conflict, and contain outrageous falsehoods.
2. BDS is an effort to destroy the State of Israel by isolating it economically, culturally, and politically.
3. The State of California should not be teaching its young people one side only in an international conflict.
4. An ethnic studies program should be making our young people aware of anti-Semitism, not teaching it.
Please take this into consideration! Thank you !
