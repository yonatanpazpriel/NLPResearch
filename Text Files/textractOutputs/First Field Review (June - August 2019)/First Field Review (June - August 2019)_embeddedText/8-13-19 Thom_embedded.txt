While you mention Jewish American Studies along with all the other ethnicities, it appears that you left out the unit specifically for Jewish American Studies. For example:  samplecoursemodelsesmc includes African American Studies Course
Outline, Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies Course Outline, Asian American Studies Course Outline, and so on, but there is no Jewish American Studies Course Outline.  appendicesesmc also includes units for these other studies, but none for Jewish Studies.

At a time when antisemitism is at a high and is so overt, I think any ethnic studies course has to include a course in Jewish American studies.
