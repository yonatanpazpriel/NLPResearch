I read through the proposed curriculum. I object to its being implemented in any shape or form. I see it as a way to turn children into activists instead of teaching them the basics or math, English, factual history and applied sciences.
I can't understand why these radical topics would take precedence over addition, subtraction, grammar, punctuation, the Constitution, algebra, Biology, Physics. Many people I met, young and old, have no idea how to make change, talk or write in complete sentences, and confuse ideology with facts. If schools would narrow their focus (the basics) I believe they would achieve better results.
Fift (plus) years after the Liberal/Left Education movement started, we produce less and less competent, articulate, well-mannered people than ever before. This, despite the TRILLIONS of dollars the Dept of Education has squandered.
I urge you to NOT pass this miasma of rhetoric and misguided agenda.
