From: Karen Macarah Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:32 AM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern:
I agree with the LA Times editorial concerning the proposed new ethnic studies curriculum that: "it is in bad need of an overhaul. The final curriculum should emphasize the deep, disturbing and complex facts of racial and ethnic history, respecting differences of opinion, and encouraging open discussion on an often difficult subject." As proposed, the curriculum feels one-sided and appears to push a single perspective that will make many students feel uncomfortable or, worse yet, marginalized and silenced. Please re-work this curriculum to be less one-sided and more encouraging of individual perspectives and critical thinking.
Sincerely,
Karen Macarah
