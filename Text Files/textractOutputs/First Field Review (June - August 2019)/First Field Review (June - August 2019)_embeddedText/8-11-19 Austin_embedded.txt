It is disturbing that a course designed to identify and correct bias directed to historically underrepresented people is vetted during the summer months with a cumbersome comment document requiring technology skills lacking in many disadvantaged communities.

As the August 15th deadline for comments approaches, the content of this "model" curriculum is starting to circulate throughout our community. Our Board of Education has had no opportunity to review or comment on the curriculum with a summer "dead" period. Our PTA was unaware of the content and has no opportunity to hold meaningful dialogues over the summer.

The curriculum is flawed in many ways, including a clear political slant and agenda. Members of our Jewish community are outraged and need to be heard. They are not alone. The document has inconceivable errors for something sure to be scrutinized.

The Palo Alto Unified School District will continue to develop our Ethnic Studies curriculum and will not look to the "model" course as a guide.
