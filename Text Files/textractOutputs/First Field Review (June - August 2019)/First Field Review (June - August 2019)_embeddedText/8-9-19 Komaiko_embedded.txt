From: Leslee K Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 10:58 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Thoughts on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am a California resident and a parent of school age children.
While I applaud the plan to develop a model curriculum in ethnic studies, the draft that has been created is highly problematic.
In fact, as it stands, it will likely further marginalize already marginalized groups.
Significant revisions are necessary. Thank you.
