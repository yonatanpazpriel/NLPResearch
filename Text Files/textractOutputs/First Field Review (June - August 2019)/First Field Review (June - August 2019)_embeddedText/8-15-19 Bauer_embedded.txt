As a Jewish American, it is appalling that there is no mention of Jewish Americans and the Anti-Semitism, immigration patterns that is our history due to the persecution throughout time and most importantly the Holocaust. AntiSemitism is still occurring in the U.S. There have been Anti-Semitic acts in Orange County, CA in the past few years. To include topics of Anti-Arab history and terrorism against Arabs, and make absolutely no mention of all the AntiSemitism that the Jewish people have endured, is unacceptable. If the goal is teaching about ethnicities and what they have endured, then you must include a fair and accurate representation of their history. The only mention of Israel is clearly anti-Israel (calling for boycott, divest, and sanction against Israel), and this is clearly unacceptable. This just promotes more anti-Israel, Anti-Semitic sentiments in this country and creates a dangerous environment for Jewish people.
