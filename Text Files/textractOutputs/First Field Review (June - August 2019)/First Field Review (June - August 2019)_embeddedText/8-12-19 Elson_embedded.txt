From: Ellyn Elson Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2019 3:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Rabbi Subject: Comments on Ethnic Study Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern:
One of the greatest threats to Jewish individuals in this country is the misinformation and radical anti-Semitic comments by white nationalists and others, and the hatred against the state of Israel. This curriculum fails to address this most important subject and in fact, includes information that is unbalanced (BDS discussion), lyrics about Jews controlling the money, etc. The state of California Board of Education should be ashamed of their lack of sensitivity to this important area of misplaced prejudice that exists not only in California and the US but throughout the world. I will urge my State representatives to object to the implementation of this curriculum until it has been sufficiently rewritten.
Respectfully,
Ellyn Elson Napa, CA.
