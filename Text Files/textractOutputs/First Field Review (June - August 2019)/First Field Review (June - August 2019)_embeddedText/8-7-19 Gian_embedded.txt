From: Shlomi Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 6:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear committee,
I was shocked to read that my three kids who are all part of the Los Gatos CA school district might end up taking a class that mixes important topics with political agenda against the state of Israel.
As a proud American-Israeli I find the proposed curriculum (which I hope fill never get approved) to not only be politically driven but also insulting.
I strongly request that the items listed in red will be excluded from the class or I will have to reconsider the future of my kids education outside of the system that permits mixing politics and academic studies .

Thanks you for reading.
Regards, Shlomi Gian CEO
