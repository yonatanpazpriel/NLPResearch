This proposed curriculum is totally unfair and inaccurate in describing many aspects of Israel and its relation to neighboring countries. It will incite hatred among students, and lead to future decisions based on false knowledge of the world. Its motivation must be questioned, as such accidental inaccurate and false statements and themes could not all be appearing by coincidence or accident. IT MUST BE RECTIFIED.
