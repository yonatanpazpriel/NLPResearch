General Comments

Carla Young Garrett President, Center for Economic and Civic Education, a California nonprofit corporation dedicated to educating our student on the on the beauty and strength of the US Constitution.
Additionally, I was a student at SF State during the time we students were working to establish the first Black Studies/Ethnic Studies Dept. in the country. I was part of that group of Black, Hispanic, Asian, Native American and white students working tirelessly on this project.
A final note. As a credentialed elementary and secondary teacher (I taught government/economics), I was on a compliance review committee that reviewed basal reading for treatment of minorities, so have a perspective on this process.

My experiences as a teacher and curriculum writer (I have over 25 published lesson/simulations) are that: 1) Balanced points are view are essential. So a pressing question is: Why is the State of Israel being singled out? From what I can see, the document represents a particular political perspective: those that see the Arabs in the West Bank living in "apartheid conditions" without mentioning the terror inflicted by them on the people of Israel. Another example of this biased perspective is the use of the word Nabka, to describe the creation of the State of Israel (which as we know was done by the United Nations after the Holocaust). If the Ethnic Studies curriculum includes the word Nabka, it most also include the world (UN) perspective as well as the Jewish one. Further, if you are going to mention the BDS, then you need mention all the bombings and terror acts committed again the people of Israel (not the State) and give a balanced perspective. There is right and wrong on both sides.
2) We have many recent, violent examples of anti-Semitism (Charlottesville, the Tree of Life Synagogue, Poway and many others). And what is one of the common traits of these shooters? They got radicalized by what they read and were influenced by the opinions of others.
The State of California is usually a place of sanctuary and sanity in our increasingly crazy, hate-filled world. I strongly doubt that we want to create curriculum that teaches one group of student to hate another and perpetuate another mass killing.
