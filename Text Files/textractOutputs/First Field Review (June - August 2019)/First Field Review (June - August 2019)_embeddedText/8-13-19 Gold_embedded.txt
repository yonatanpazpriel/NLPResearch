I am concerned about what is not included in the document. While there is significant time dedicated to the study of the Arab immigrants, there is very little content about the Jewish immigration to the US, or the long history of Jewish contributions to American society. Furthermore, there is no mention of the Anti-Semitism experienced by the Jewish community. Please present a more comprehensive curriculum that is in line with the size and contributions of the Jewish community.

Additionally, the reference to Israel on line 5030 refers to the country as Israel/Palestine. Israel is an independent nation which was established in 1948. There is no country called "Israel/Palestine". Please correct this.
