From: gary lambert Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 7:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposal
As a former high school teacher, there is already not enough time to get students through current requirements.
Further, this is not a serious course, but rather a course in greavance studies and indoctrination with a clear political bias.
Don't pass this bill.
