I would like to express my objection to the proposed curriculum.
The ESMC presents an unbalanced account of the Arab/ Israeli conflict.
It, unfortunately, elevates the BDS movement which unfairly targets the State of Israel and advocates its destruction.
Moreover, it avoids any reference to the rising plague of antisemitism in the U.S.
The curriculum is unfair and needs to be redesigned.
