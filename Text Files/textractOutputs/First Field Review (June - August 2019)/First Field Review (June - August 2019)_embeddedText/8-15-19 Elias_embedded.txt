1. There is no definition of "Antisemitism" � a major cause of hate crimes throughout the world and throughout world history: during Ancient Rome, the Inquisition, the expulsions in England, the Holocaust, restrictive covenants in the USA, etc.
2. On Page 2, in the "Glossary," the following definition is included:
Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)- is a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions . . .
This sentence includes an extremely biased and false statement that Palestinians live under "apartheid" conditions in Israel. In South Africa. "apartheid" was a statutory condition imposed upon persons of color to separate them from white individuals. This condition DOES NOT exist in Israel. Persons who identify as Palestinian work openly in Israel alongside Israeli citizens, travel on the same public transportation as Israelis, have access to the same public facilities as Israelis, etc. I have been to Israel, and I have seen this firsthand.
3. The Holocaust or "Shoah" is not included in the Glossary. This horrific event was the murder of millions of Jews, Gypsies (Roma), homosexuals, and the disabled. It was the ultimate example of what happens when ethnic differences are not respected. If you are going to have a curriculum called "Ethnic Studies" then you must include episodes of so-called "ethnic cleansing" through history.
