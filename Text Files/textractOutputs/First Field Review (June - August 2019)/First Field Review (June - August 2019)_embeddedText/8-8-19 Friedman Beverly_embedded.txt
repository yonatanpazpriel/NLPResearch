Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I urge you to remove support for the BDS movement from the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum as it denigrates Israel and the Jewish people. I also urge you to include the history of the Jewish people as an ethnic group, including the oppression they have had to deal with during the Holocaust, the Middle East and Russia.
