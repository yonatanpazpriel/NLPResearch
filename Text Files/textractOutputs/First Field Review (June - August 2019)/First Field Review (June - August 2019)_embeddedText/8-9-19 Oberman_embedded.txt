I am deeply concerned and against the approval of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum as it is now written. This curriculum promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry.
It does not include history lessons about the Jewish people, our traditions, or our history of suffering as victims of hatred and persecution.

I respectfully request the removal of the BDS and other anti-Israel bias from this curriculum, as they promote hate and anti-Semitism.

Respectfully submitted, Deedy Oberman,
