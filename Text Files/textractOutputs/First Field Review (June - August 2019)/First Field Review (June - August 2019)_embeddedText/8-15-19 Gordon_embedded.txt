I have read the overview and it reads like a design for an anti-establishment political movement and a rejection of the concept that a functioning society is and should be based on a set of shared ideals. It focuses on ethnic identity rather than and how current and prior immigrant groups can/have draw(n) from and contribute(d) to national shared ideals.

The course outline isn't much better, it seems to confuse ethnicity, race and nationality. As I mentioned above, it looks like the design for an anti-establishment political movement hidden behind shallow ethnic studies. Some of the courses weigh heavy towards propaganda rather than scholarship, most of the academic points insufficient documental support and play down alternative viewpoints. The American political, economic and cultural landscape has absorbed and been shaped significantly by the constantly changing ethnic mix of the population, I just don't see that being effectively communicated in this curriculum.

Lessons seem focused on ethnocentrism and civic action, for a select set of ethnic groups defined by the committee. It ignores that each of these groups themselves are ethnically diverse. Strangely, though the curriculum is focused on the non-European , ethnic-American experience, it strangely makes an effort to throw in the Israeli-Arab conflict. What a strange political agenda to through in this curriculum. I would think a better international lesson would be the discussion of apartheid, but it is not mentioned once. Furthermore, despite the mention of the Israel-Arab conflict, it doesn't mention antisemitism until page 289, in the Pacific Islander Studies section no less. In a world full of major ethnic conflicts it ignores them all save the Israel-Arab conflict. So much great source material for ethnic studies completely ignored.

It is really embarrassing what this committee has proposed. I hope the state asks for a refund for the tax payer dollars wasted, more so I feel sorry for the students of these committee members who could not produce an product that would pass peer review.
