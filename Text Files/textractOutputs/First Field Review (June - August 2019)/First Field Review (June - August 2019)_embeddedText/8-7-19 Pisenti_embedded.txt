From: Tina Pisenti Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 9:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern:
I have reviewed your proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for 2020 and have shared this with friends. We have agreed that this program is:
Laughable Absurd Pathetic Embarrassing A waste of tax dollars Crap
None of us found merit in this program and we represent a mix of racial and ethnic backgrounds.
Going forward, please focus on teaching California's public school students how to read, write, spell, think critically, perform mathematical calculations, have even passable knowledge of history, civics, geography, and the sciences. Start with that. The basics.
The California public school system is one of the worst in the country, routinely testing at or near the bottom. All of your energies should be directed towards bringing students towards a basic level of proficiency in core subjects. You waste everyone's time and money by introducing idiotic programs like this into the general curriculum. Relegate this to the dustbin, along with the comprehensive sex education program, that has parents all across the state steaming mad.
American colleges and universities have become a laughingstock, so instead of emulating their nonsense by introducing programs like this one into the K-12 system, please surprise us all and actually exercise sound judgment. Stop indoctrinating the next generation with mountains of garbage. We're all growing weary of your incompetence and cluelessness.
In short, toss this program in the trash. It may be the smartest thing you do all day.
Sincerely, Tina Pisenti
