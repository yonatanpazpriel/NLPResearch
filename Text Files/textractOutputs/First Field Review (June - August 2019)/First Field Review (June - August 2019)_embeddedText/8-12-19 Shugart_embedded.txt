The document ignores the Jewish experience of anti-Semitism. As if Jews were not a minority in America and California, and as if the Jewish experience were not something from which students being exposed to diversity can learn. It frequently references organizations or testimonials that demonize Israel. It is deeply one-sided and exclusionary, the very opposite of what should be in a curriculum supposedly intended to create sensitivity to diversity.
A FEW selected examples are commented on below.

p. 35, line 684. Lists the "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions Movement for Palestine" among the social movements to which teachers might assign students for a class activity. "Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions" (BDS) is anti-Semitic. It is not an ordinary social movement to improve the lives of Americans or others, but a movement to delegitimize the State of Israel. In my own experience working with Jewish students at UC Davis, I know that BDS activism regularly targets Jewish students for exclusion, sometimes with threats of violence. BDS is aligned with movements that seek to support terrorism and destroy Israel. It has no place in a role-playing activity in our public schools. p. 234, line 4956. Again lists anti-Israel organizations and activities as models. "Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter" This implies a false equivalence between Palestinian movements and domestic US struggles. Palestinian movements have regularly used terrorism against Israeli civilians and even against Jews abroad. The situation is extremely complex and politically fraught, and in no way similar to the movement to reduce American police forces' application of violence against African-Americans.
p. 234, line 4958. Again lists anti-Israel organizations and activities as models. "Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico". This implies a false equivalence between an international border between the US and Mexico, and the security barrier constructed by Israel to stop terrorist attacks originating in the Palestinian Territories.

p. 241, lines 5137-8. "The first wave came mostly from a region of the Ottoman

Empire then called Syria (which includes the modern states of Syria, Lebanon,

and Palestine/Israel)..." This phrasing delegitimizes the state of Israel by

rendering it as "Palestine/Israel." There is no such state.

p. 242, lines 5158-61. "The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War)." This is an EXTRMELY one-sided and inflammatory rendering of the history of the reestablishment of Jewish sovereignty in the Jewish people's historic homeland--the creation of the modern State of Israel. The phrasing mentions only the view of the Arab world's anti-democratic political leaders, by treating the establishment of Israel as a "catastrophe"; it mis-characterizes the events of the first Arab-Israeli War when the Arab side rejected a partition ("two-state solution") and neighboring states invaded and attempted to destroy the nascent Jewish state.
