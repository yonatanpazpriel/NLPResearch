Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. This movement is divisive and promotes hate and anti-semitism, the level of which has increased alarmingly worldwide. Because of BDS, companies like Soda Stream, which employed Jews, Arabs, and Palestians who worked together effectively and did more to promote peace than any political movement, were forced to move out of the West Bank. In addition, BDS has refused to accept Israel's right to exist and has links to terrorist groups-is this really what we want to teach our children? Instead, you could highlight the many groups working cooperatively inside and outside of Israel to promote peace, such as The Alliance for Middle East Peace, which is a group of over 100 organizations dedicated to promoting cooperative peace in the Middle East. Please present a balanced curriculum. For example, add lessons to this curriculum about American Jews as an ethnic group. Discuss those Jews who fled the Holocaust and/or the Middle East and the former Soviet Union. I am an Iraqi Jew whose parents fled Iraq under the threat of violence and murder. My father's uncle was hung in the town square and left as a warning to Jews to leave or face death if they remained. Most people are completely unaware that approximately 850,000 Jews were forced out of Arab & Muslim countries between 1948-1980.

My husband is a public school teacher. He has seen the impact of peace promoting agendas vs. agendas that promote division and hatred. Please be careful about the curriculum you present. Young people are our hope for a better future. We have had enough hated in American in these last four years. Please promote a curriculum that works as a force for peace, tolerance and inclusion instead of division, hatred and exclusion.
