Sir,
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is nothing but leftist propaganda. It is pure crap and one of the reasons that California education is near the bottom of US education in terms of what students know and how they can think critically. Capitalism is the economic system that has raised more people out of poverty than any other. It has been outstandingly successful in enabling the average person to realize his/her dreams. Problems remain, but capitalism is far better in creating wealth and setting people free than any other economic system. Any person who cannot recognize this is either an arrogant ideologue or terminally stupid.
