As an educator the United tastes of America, I find it vital that our student are taught the constitution and American history. It's an insult to the men and women that have fought for our freedoms that this state has the audacity to impose anti-American studies to our youth. We live in the most prosperous and generous country in the world, yet the aim of this program is to turn the next generation into socialist justice warriors. How disappointing that the leaders of California are hell-bent into ripping people apart. Only in this state could this happen. I would NEVER teach my students the information presented in this fanatical program.
