Gentlemen:
I want to raise my voice about the ESMC bill that you want to put forward for teaching the children in California about prejudice.
This bill proposes getting rid of any kind of mention about anti-Semitism and anti-Israel dealings. This is wrong.
My grandparents came to this country sometime around 1905. They came here from Russia because they were told, basically, to get out or get killed. I and my entire family have been subjects of discrimination over the years, but we don't want to live in any other country because this is the greatest country in the world, and has been the greatest for the Jews of America to live in.
We insist that they teach about the Holocaust, and about the recent extreme anti-Semitism that's been going on, what with people being shot and killed in Pennsylvania, Los Angeles, and San Diego. All because they just wanted to eliminate Jews from the world.
Israel was formed specifically for the Jews who had no place else to go, and because of the world's collective guilt for allowing the Holocaust to take place and survive. The Jews are placed as one of the most hated ethnic groups of all time, and for no reason other than we are different and we don't accept Christ as our savior.
You MUST teach about anti-Semitism, and you must not teach that Israel is a pariah. Israel has every right to exist and the Jews of the world DO NOT control the media, the banks, and the movie industry. Also, Israel is the only country in the Middle East that is a Democracy, the United States' best friend.
These ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov, aka ESMC, must include anti-Semitism to teach tolerance to the children of California and children of the United States.
Jews are every bit as much an ethnic victim of bullying and terrorism as all the other ethnic groups that exist, including LGBTQ, African Americans, Mexican and Latino Americans, and all the groups listed in your background to teach about.
Thank you.
Linda K. Rourman
