I have reviewed the ethnic studies model and find it to be egregiously racist ( anti white male ) and very left wing democrat politically. How about more facts and less rhetoric.
Teaching that capitalism is racist is simply wrong. Also how about pointing out that slaves were saved by white men of the new United States who fought and died to free them from the oppression imposed by England and Africa
