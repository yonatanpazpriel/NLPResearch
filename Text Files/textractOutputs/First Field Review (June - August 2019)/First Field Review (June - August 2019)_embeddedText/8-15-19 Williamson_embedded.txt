My comments is that schools should only teach reading, writing, math & history. Legislation is needed to prevent School Officials from indoctrinating children. This happens when only one side of an issue is presented. In the case of Israel, they have many people who are committed to annihilating these people. This was the mindset of the Nazi's. I never was taught about the Holocaust in grade school. If you're going to teach anything about cultural values, teach that hatred and killing of ANY PEOPLE GROUP is wrong.
Continue to teach that we need to be a color blind society. Teach that many while people gave their lives to abolish slavery.
