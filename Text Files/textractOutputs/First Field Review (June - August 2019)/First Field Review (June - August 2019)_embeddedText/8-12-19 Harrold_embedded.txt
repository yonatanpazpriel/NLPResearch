Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
K-12 is not appropriate for the kind of materials presented. Grades 9-12 course work, as in the original curriculum, is more suitable The use of overly politically correct language is too complicated and difficult to understand for an adult, let alone K-12, or even 9-12. Newspeak. Even more Newspeak: Hxrstory and more. This is resistance language.
The emphasis on resistance and numerous examples of violent resistance and violent depictions in music encourage rebellion at large and even violence.

Glossary & General

Anti-Semitism is not represented.
