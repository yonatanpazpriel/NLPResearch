To Whom It May Concern:
I am very upset and worried about the new Ethics Studies Curriculum that you are reviewing. As a Jew (and an educator in the San Diego Unified School District and now the Grossmont Union High School District for over 40 years), I have seen first- hand how curriculum like this effects students. I have included some information in a meme about BDS (Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions) that I have researched extensively. This meme nails the BDS movement.
Upon looking at parts of the curriculum your introduction states, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." What concerns me about this is that the curriculum only mentions Jews in passing and there is not one lesson about the Jewish community. Are you aware of this data: nationally, the Anti-Defamation League released their annual audit of anti-semitic incidents for 2018, which shoe anti-semitic incidents in California were up 27%, marking a third straight year of an increase of such incidents. Consequently with antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum and with above data in mind, this curriculum greatly worries and disturbs me. In light of the shooting at the Chabad Synagogue in Poway recently, this curriculum, which I find entirely one-sided, is only giving students the opportunity to see what is happening in the Middle East through one lens, that of the BDS movement. This scares me like you do not know.
For example, on Page 2, lines 29-40 ï¿½ this is a section that clearly promotes the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) Movement against Israel, claiming that the purpose of BDS is to "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." To begin with, I have been to Israel and this is clearly not the truth. Israel is the most accepting and democratic country in the middle east. People of every color, religion, gender preference, and sexual orientation are free to live in Israel. That cannot be said for the rest of the Middle East where women are second class citizens (e.g., women cannot drive in Saudi Arabia) and gays are beheaded. This section goes to promote one-sided BDS talking points, and does not offer any critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, including that its true purpose, as stated by its co-founder and leading activists, is to end the existence of Israel, the only Jewish state.
The regional head of the Anti-Defamation League in San Diego has stated that "When people do not believe that Israel to exist as a Jewish state or that the Jewish people do not have a right to sel-determination, we believe it is anti-Semitic" (Tammy Giles, San Diego Regional Director of the ADL).
I would be very happy to speak with you about this and offer suggestions. Please reconsider adopting this one-side, clearly anti-semitic curriculum.
Sincerely,
