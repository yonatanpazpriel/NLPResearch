Your ethnic studies curriculum looks good. I see a tremendous and needed effort to present the voice of the previously ignored, exploited and powerless. However there is an unexamined viewpoint wedged in perhaps by academic progressives, which is not sensitive to Jewish viewpoint and historical survival. Your curriculum on Jews and Israel is hostile, ignorant or neglectful. Please correct it to provide more balance.
