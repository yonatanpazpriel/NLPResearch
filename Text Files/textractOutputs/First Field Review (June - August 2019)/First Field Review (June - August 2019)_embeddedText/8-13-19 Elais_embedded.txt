Page numbers that particularly concern me include 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269, but it is the concept of the entire document that also concerns me. Every aspect of this unfortunate document embodies the very bias that this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum was supposed to fight. As one example: The definition of Whiteness, in your glossary, says being white "separates those who are privileged from those who are not." Anyone who has visited or worked at a homeless shelter in California (as I have often done) knows you will encounter at least as many whites as any other ethnic group in the very under privileged populace of the shelters. So this definition is more than just a simplification, it is an outright lie.
I would also like to endorse the July 29 letter of the Jewish Caucus of the California Legislature, which objects to the absolute elimination of the age-old phenomenon of anti-Semitism from the lexicon. Your draft curriculum does not even touch on this, while endorsing the cause of organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah, among whose stated, written and never withdrawn purposes is not just the elimination of the state of Israel, but also the killing of Jews anywhere in the world where they can be found. In a state which has very recently seen a white supremacist machine-gun attack on a synagogue in San Diego County, this is an invitation to more violence against Jews.
Moreover, your curriculum completely ignores the entire American Jewish experience, from overcoming college admission quotas and bias in real estate deeds to winning more Nobel Prizes than any other ethnic group, despite the persecution to which Jews have been subjected for most of the last 2000 years. You also ignore Jewish contributions to the United States, from inventing antibiotics to taking leading roles in every American armed conflict. Referring to Jews and the world's only Jewish state solely as oppressors is turning history on its head, teaching the very opposite of historical truth.
If the state Board of Education adopts this evil document, that board will go down in history with other anti-Semites who have tried to eliminate Jews in

the interests of racial purity and other vile concepts opposed by the rest of your draft curriculum. The board would be remembered as a milder version of anti-Semites from Persia's Haman to Germany's Hitler and the Ukraine's Chemielinski, leader of many Medieval pogroms.
No one would deny that African Americans and Chicanos have been oppressed, but no one ever tried to eliminate them from the face of the earth. This has been tried against Jews several times, and always been defeated. If you try to eliminate the American Jewish experience and portray Jews as privileged oppressors, you also will end up in the dustbin of history, right along with other anti-Semites.
You need to redo this document almost completely and you need to be much more careful about who you choose for that task than you have been with this unfortunate, inaccurate and hateful first effort.
