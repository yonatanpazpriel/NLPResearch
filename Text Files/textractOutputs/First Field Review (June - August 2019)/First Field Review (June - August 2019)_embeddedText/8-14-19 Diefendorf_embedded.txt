Hello, As a retired public teacher in California, I would like to make a comment regarding the ethnic studies curriculum. I feel that it must be as objective as possible. I've read about certain portions being somewhat left-leaning and blaming societal problems on Caucasian settlers and founders. I've also read where a portion on capitalism is actually blaming capitalism for all the ills of society. If all of this is true, then this is just a one sided, shameful curriculum. Both sides of every issue should be mentioned in whatever the argument or lesson is about. This curriculum should not be a blame game. Facts should be presented, not the slanted opinions of the framers of this curriculum. Thank you, David C. Diefendorf
