I am one of many who strongly urge you to remove antisemitic stereotypes, BDS, and all antiIsrael bias from the curriculum. I urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group and antisemitism as a form of racism. This should include American Jews who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the Former Soviet Union, among others.
There is already too much divisiveness and hatred of "not like us" others in our country. The only effective way to stop this is help people, especially our children, to know and understand others, all others, as real people, with histories , traditions, struggles, aspirations, and a dream that in America we can all live respectfully and peacefully together.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Joan M. Bernick
