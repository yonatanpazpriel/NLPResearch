From: Kathy Sellers Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 2:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Disservice to students
I just reviewed the proposed ethnic studies curriculum and find it disturbing! Including capitalism in the category of white supremacy and power??? Has the Dept of Education lost their minds? Please start over and reject this far-left format. By the way, I have been a registered Democrat my entire adult life and my daughter is a California school teacher. Our school system is an abysmal failure in this state. DO SOMETHING!!!
