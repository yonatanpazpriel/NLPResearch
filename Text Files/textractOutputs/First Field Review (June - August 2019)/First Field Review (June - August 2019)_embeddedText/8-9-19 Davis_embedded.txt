Hi Educators,
I am very concerned about public school ethnic studies class teaching BDS; this is a very polarizing subject and despite its proponents, I believe it to be anti-Semitic.
I do not believe there should be a place for this in our public school system. BDS ultimate goal is the destruction of Israel as a Jewish state. Jews have lived in Israel continuously for millennia. We have a right to live there in peace.
Amcha brought this to my attention. It is very disheartening that I even have to write this letter. What is happening to the state of California? Is everything we do and learn to be tainted by far-left progressives and their agenda?
