From: Rachel Wizenfeld Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 1:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
Attached are several comments on the proposed curriculum. As a Jewish American who promotes cross-dialogue and depolarization efforts through my work with Better Angels, I was extremely distressed by the tone and agenda of this document, the lack of fairness and impartiality with regards to Israel's perspective in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the lack of mention of anti-Semitism in this state, country and around the world, and the narrow political ideology present throughout.
I hope my comments and concerns, and those of many others with similar views and concerns, will be respected and taken seriously.
Best regards Rachel Wizenfeld
