I am concerned about the ethnic studies model curriculum and would like to ask that it not be adopted.

The following are some of the reasons why I believe the ethnic studies model curriculum should not be adopted:

I don't believe that capitalism is racist. I believe capitalism is beneficial to the world.

I am concerned that the model curriculum would cause more disharmony than harmony in society.

I am concerned with jargon that are used, such as cisheteropatriarchy and hxrstory.

I believe the model curriculum attempts to redefine reality.

There is an ideological bias in the model curriculum.

Parents should be allowed to opt-out ethnic studies using this model curriculum.

As a result, please do not adopt the ethnic studies model curriculum.
