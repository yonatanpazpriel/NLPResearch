General

I do not see a single lesson plan about the Jewish community that is also a part of our society. As the mother of a daughter who was confronted verbally with vehemently anti-Jewish harangue in middle school in San Diego and drawings of swastikas, I am appalled at the absence of discussion about the growth of antiSemitism in our communities, not to mention the proliferation of propaganda without real discussion. We are a family with holocaust survivors and tragically many who did not survive. BDS precludes discussion. Anti-Semitism is on the rise and needs to be addressed at all levels of education.
