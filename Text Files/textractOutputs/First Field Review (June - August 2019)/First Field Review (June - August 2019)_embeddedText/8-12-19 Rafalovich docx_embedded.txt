I understand that the given documents are examples but the seem very biased and tend to generate more hate and intolerance than they aim to solve. This is named "Ethnic Studies" but is setup to be more about "Ethnic Conflict". It forces the participants to pick a side. (Usually biased to the "non-white" side) This curriculum focuses on conflicts yet gives no tools to move forward. As most classrooms are highly diverse, this creates an "us" and a "them". Many of the mentioned issues run very deep. A typical high schooler of the current generation does not have the time or the discipline to study these conflicts in depth. A shallow look at these issues only seeds anger and misinformation.
Every single person in the USA has come from somewhere. All have been through generations of hardships and discrimination. Some have moved forward in-spite of the hardships, others have used it as a crutch to excuse their lower social and economic standings. (This hold true for any other country as well as the US)
If the intent here is to help young adults develop and move forward in life (as should be the point in all schooling), the focus should be on "Ethnic Integration". Teach teens how different cultures that came here to the US have managed to excel and become integrated parts of society. How diversity is a positive influence when done gradually and in taste. Not "shoved down ones throat".
The current layout will only strengthen the divide between young adults and give many of them an excuse to use previous generations hardships for entitlement. Basically, this curriculum in its current form will have no positive effects on the intended population.
