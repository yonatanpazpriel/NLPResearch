From: Jeremy Johnson Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 8:53 AM To: CFIRD Subject: BDS Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
Hello. My name is Jeremy Johnson and I am a Jew. I have just recently heard of the heart breaking curriculum that is BDS. I'm not sure why there would be such a thing allowed in a university in the state of California which claims to be a state of tolerance and anti-hate. There might be some disagreement in our modern day about Israel, but it is nonetheless a nation that must be acknowledged as any other nation. To say otherwise simply is a move against history. There is much slander and lying in the air about the people of Israel (But not limited to Israel) about different things. But to jump to teaching in a university something of such anti-Semitic hate, and on top of that, before any true investigation is done is highly foolish and destructive. It is extremely divisive and counter-productive to tolerance and diversity. This type of rhetoric is what began the holocaust of Germany. Please listen to the lessons of history and remove such things a place of education. If the individuals hate Israel in their own opinion, we have freedom of speech and they may speak publicly about what ever they wish. But I pray that it not be taught as a curriculum in a place where someone can be given harm to their transcripts if they take the class and do not agree with such a curriculum.
P.S. If you listen to those who have spoken out in the UN assembly, you will find the there are Palestinians that call their own government and representatives as disingenuous (Yousef Mosab Hassan is an example). This is why we must not be hasty and foolish. But instead listen to wisdom that says, "The first one to speak seems right, until another cross-examines him." (Yousef Mosab Hassan is an example).
