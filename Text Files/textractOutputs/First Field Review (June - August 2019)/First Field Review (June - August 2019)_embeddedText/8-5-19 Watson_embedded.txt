Page 2 lines 26-28. The implication of defining a group as marginalized is highly prejudicial. Recommendation: use the Merriam-Webster definition: process through which individuals of differing heritages acquire the basic habits, attitudes, and mode of life of an embracing culture, Page 2 lines 42-47. First sentence is factually incorrect. "...largely controlled by private companies instead of the government" ignores the millions of individuals who run their own small businesses, practice their trade (farmer, plumbers, handymen, lawn services) and ignores the regulatory role of the government which helps make the system work. Recommendation: Use the Merriam Webster definition: An economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly be competion in a free market. The last two sentences are propaganda again emphasizing the major defect of the Ethnic Studies curriculum: it pushed the idea that all minorities are victims of capitalism and totally ignores how modern capitalism has lifted all ethnic groups.

Page 2 lines 30-40. Why was the BDS definition included? It seems like an isolated fragment that is very specific, not a general term needed. It also serves as a propaganda piece to promote the Palestinian cause. Where is the equivalent definition which shows the other side to this conflict? People who reign terror on innocent people are not good for humanity living in peace and harmony. Recommendation: eliminate this definition from the glossary. Page 15, lines 366-372. As a white person, I find this definition offensive and inaccurate. The second sentence is inflammatory and not accurate. Claiming a white person is privileged is incorrect. Claiming the standard or cultural norm is "often" always based on whiteness is propaganda to convince people of color that their culture is ignored. Why not promote American culture as a melting pot of many cultures which it is. Your focus on identity politics promotes separating people instead of assimilating into a common culture. Recommendation: Reword this definition or just eliminate it � I do not see it as an objective principle to be teaching. Pages 2-5 Outline presents a very comprehensive set of unit which will be very beneficial to learning (Golden Valley High School, Santa Clarita) Page 10, line 64. This assignment requires the student to analyze one "marginalized" group. That assumes there is one to analyze. What is the criteria for stating that group is marginalized. Recommendation: do not call a group marginalized. Let the student write about a group he is familiar with or wants to know more about. (Stockton Unified School District) Page 15 , lines 544-550. Students are required to produce a manifesto that lists and justifies their demands for reform of the current education system, then prepare a lesson for students in a neighboring middle school. The term "demands" implies the students have to be aggressive rather than recommending changes be considered. Demanding without listening to the other side of an issue is not a learning experience. Recommendation: Tone down the rhetoric and be more objective. (San Unified School District)

Page 21, line 792-794. Requires taking direct action, implementing a systematized campaign for social justice at the school. This is an aggressive approach which is confrontational and forces students to invent a problem if there is not one. Recommendation: If students identify a problem, they can make the arguments for changing it, but do not force them to take action on a nonproblem. Page 30, lines1222-1225. The statement is made that "it is simply no enough to learn about historical moments and agents of social justice, students must be empowered to be agents of social justice here at SAMOHI. The assignment is then to establish and implement a social justice program. The language implies required activism on a perceived problem whether it is real or not. Recommendation: Study a perceived issue, but do not require taking action on it as if it is real. This implies the students are running the school, not the people responsible ..teachers and principle. (San Juan High School, Citrus Heights) Page 36. Lines 1436-1440. This section is inflammatory and implies that few are in power in America. Recommendation: Eliminate it. (Aspire Public Schools, Oakland)

P115 lines 4713-4715. Text seems to be anti-ICE. Is this a propaganda campaign for open borders. Recommendation: Write a unit explaining steps to legal immigration to the US. Do not promote illegal immigration. P117 lines 4795-4796. Text asks how gang injunctions are hurtful to Communities of Color. Don't gangs pray on innocent people in their communities? Is this material arguing to let gangs do what they want. This seems to be an anti-law enforcement campaign. Recommendation: make this more supportive of the police and the justice system to stop violence and crime. Page 118. Lines 4839-4841. Text says there is a lack of healthy food options in Communities of Color across LA. Are you implying there are no grocery stores? This sounds like a set up to blame the power structure for a non-problem. Recommendation: Focus on real issues that the community could solve by promoting better eating habits and staying off drugs and alcohol. (Camino Nuevo High School, LA) General comment: My impression is that a lot of this material, although some contains very useful historical perspectives, has too much negative propaganda about trying to convince students to become activists as opposed to taking advantage of their background to help them become successful in life.
