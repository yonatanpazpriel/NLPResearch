General Comment: I love the state of California. I came to California as a refugee at the age of nine. I have a lot of respect and gratitude for the California education system. I finished middle school, high school, and graduated from UC San Diego. Having reviewed the curriculum, I would like to ask the inclusion of American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust. I would like a discussion of Jews struggle/survival in the Middle East, including but not limited to the speech of Iranian leaders aimed at extermination of Israel and Jews. As a member of the group, I would like to add discussion of discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

Glossary, Page 2, Line 30 Definition of BDS � This definition of BDS claims the purpose of BDS is to, "establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions". It includes the BDS talking points while offering no critical perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's existence. I have personally been impacted by this campaign of hate by organizations in support of BDS that have bullied me in working on research projects with Israeli counterparts.

Page 268, Line 5802 � The poem frames the conflict as complete oppression of palestenians by Israelis, associating Israel with general negative concept of Imperialism. I believe this is one sided. I would like more discussion added around Israel as a home of Muslim, Christians, and Jews for thousands of years preceding � back through ages of Roman Empire. This shows that this land does not belong to a single group and Jews have as much right to be there as anyone else.

I have no disagreement that stereotypes are horrible and myths need to be dispelled. However, in the discussion of line 5561 stating "terrorists, blow up airlines, try to "destroy Israel" and "drive the Jews into the sea" I don't see anything in the chapter discussing the 1972 Munich Massacre of Israelis by Palestinian Terrorists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre ) I searched the document for "Hamas", whose stated agenda is the destruction of Israel, and it is legitimate governing party/body in Gaza. I would also advocate for the addition of First and Second Intifada, it's triggers, and outcomes like many bus bombings, restaurant bombings, and other terrorist activity in Israel. Finally, Yasser Arafat is not mentioned anywhere. His history is complicated as he was involved with terrorism, but he was also a Nobel Prize Winner and embodies the Palestinian identity/struggle. I'm surprised by the omission of Mr. Arafat and surrounding complicated context of that individual.
