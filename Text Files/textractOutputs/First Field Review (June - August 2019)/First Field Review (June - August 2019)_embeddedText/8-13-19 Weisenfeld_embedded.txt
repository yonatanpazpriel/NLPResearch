I think the program is really important. But as written it appears to promote hatred not empathy and understanding.
Not only do you exclude antisemitism but your program actually seems to promote hatred against Jews. It appears that you treat BDS and Black Lives Matter as similar and you do not really teach about the history of Israel.
I also consider myself to be pretty liberal and have many problems with the right wing government in Israel. And I support BLM but programs like this make me question the movement and whether it is in fact anti-me. This program is also going to confuse Jewish children, especially Israeli immigrants who know about antisemitism and will not know what to think when they are taught about Muslims and Black people in a way that is anti-jewish. Your program actually promotes hate and I am sure that is not how it is meant.
