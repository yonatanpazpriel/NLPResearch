Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Pg. 2, Line 44-46: The glossary entry for Capitalism should be defined without a negative bias. The discussion of what is good or bad about it should be done elsewhere. Pg. 20, Line 449: Capitalism should not be treated as a form of oppression. A discussion of what capitalism is and its pros and cons is appropriate, but capitalism should not be demonized. The curriculum should certainly not bash capitalism without a balanced discussion of what the alternatives are, and the pros and cons of those systems. Many of the things in our current economic system that disadvantage ethnic minorities are things like occupational licensing laws, which interfere with "free trade" and therefore are not a valid piece of capitalism.
