From: Larry Goldfield Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Anne Chomyn Subject: Anti-Semitism on Steroids
The proposed ethnic-studies curriculum and its treatment of Jewish Americans and Israel, is tantamount to a crash course in anti-Semitism. It focuses on a broad array of minority groups, including Arab Americans, while totally ignoring the Jewish community, a community that has experienced many more times the number of terrorist attacks in the last few years. It promotes the BDS movement, a discriminatory attempt to undermine Israel's legitimacy as a Jewish state. The BDS leadership is on record opposing "a Jewish state in any part of Palestine."
Going through the Glossary, there are many other terms that could be discriminatory, and fit an agenda that will likely cause extreme controversy in several corners. I would implore the Board to rethink this project, at least make the committee, more inclusive.
