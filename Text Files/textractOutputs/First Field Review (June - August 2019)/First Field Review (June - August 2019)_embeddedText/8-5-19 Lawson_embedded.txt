Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am respectfully requesting the removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum in the State of California, inclusion is valued and BDS promotes hate and division, I urge the state to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who led the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union- Thank You All, Nancy K. Lawson
