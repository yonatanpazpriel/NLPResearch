 The identification of the country of Israel as "Israel-Palestine" and then as "Palestine/Israel."
This is an outrageous suggestion as the country is recognized as Israel by the United States.
Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel

Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico

These suggested topics for student reports are ridiculous. This is pure liberal brainwashing. The fact that Israel is singled out in so many of these topics reveals that this is just thinly veiled anti-Semitism. How come no other country's borders are up for debate? The boycott, divest and sanction Israel movement is all about destroying the one of the only democratic countries in the Middle East.

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
 The definition of Nakba as the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War.
This idea is straight out of the PLO/Hamas talking points. This whole course is just propaganda and shouldn't be foisted on teenagers who don't understand the historical context of these events.
