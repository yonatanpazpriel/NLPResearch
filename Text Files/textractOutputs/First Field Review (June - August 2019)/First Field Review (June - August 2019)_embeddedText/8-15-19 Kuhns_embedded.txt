Page 234, lines 4957 and 4958: It seems inappropriate to teach the boycott, divest, sanction (BDS) movement without including other information about the complex disputes in the Middle East. The "Palestine and Mexico" comparative border study topic also deals with controversial issues without bringing in enough background material. Page 242, line 5159: Describing the conflict in 1948 as "the Nakba" is one-sided. Other viewpoints should be included. General: there is no discussion of anti-Semitism in the document.
General: there is no reference to Jewish immigration or Jewish Americans. California in particular has been home to numerous Jewish scholars, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, writers, actors and politicians who have made major contributions to the state and the country. General: in discussing immigration and refugees, there is no mention of Jewish refugees. California became home to many Jewish refugees fleeing oppression before and after World War II. General: there is no discussion of Armenian immigration, the Armenian genocide, nor the contributions to California's history by prominent ArmenianAmericans.
