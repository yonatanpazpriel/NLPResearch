From: Tiffanie Jensen Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 1:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Study Curriculum
This is a General Comment AGAINST teaching this Curriculum!
This is radical propaganda being forced upon our children and us as parent's. Capitalism and Father Figures are NOT racist!!!
We will fight to keep this out of our schools!
