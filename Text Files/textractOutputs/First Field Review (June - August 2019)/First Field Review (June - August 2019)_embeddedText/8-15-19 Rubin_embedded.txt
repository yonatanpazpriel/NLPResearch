1. Glossary Page 2, Lines 30-40
a. This definition of BDS is incomplete at best, and intellectually dishonest/one-sided at worst. From a practical standpoint, it makes no mention of the significant harm BDS does to Arab families and workers employed by Israeli companies (I personally know of Arab men and women that have lost their jobs because of BDS). It makes no mention of how its founder and many of its leaders and chief proponents have also been associated with and sympathizers of terrorist groups that are committed to murdering innocent men, women and children only because they are Jewish, and wiping Israel off the map. More broadly, throughout the entire curriculum, there is not a single perspective offered that is critical of BDS, or even provides an alternate view. BDS is a campaign of hate and seeks to end Israel's existence - its founder himself is on the record in stating that even if Israel ends the "occupation", they will not stop the movement. The students will be lacking full context should BDS be taught as-is.
2. Course Model Page 234, Lines 4957 and 4958
a. Drawing moral and practical equivalence between Israel's efforts to prevent terrorists from entering communities and murdering innocent people, and the US's southern border policy is simply inconsistent with the reality of both situations. It trivializes both the plight of many Mexican people seeking asylum in the US. It also fails to recognize murderous intentions of some (certainly not all, or even most) Palestinians towards Jews. Perhaps mentioning how violent attacks have decreased as barriers have been constructed would be instructive to mention.
3. "" Page 237, Lines 5024-5032
a. Given the context here, there is a strong implication that "Israel-Palestine" is a single Arab nation. That is, of course, fundamentally untrue. Perhaps this part of the curriculum would be appropriate to teach students about the origin of the name "Palestine" � that it is derived from the name Syria Palaestina, invented by the Romans ~135 AD in an effort to eliminate any Jewish associations with the land of Israel, and named after the biblical Philistines. With the emphasis on Palestine throughout the curriculum, surely the origin of the name should be mentioned?
4. "" Page 242, Lines 5154-5163
a. Quite simply, this frames the 1948 War from the Palestinian perspective as fact, with no alternate perspectives. No mention of every surrounding Arab nation attacking the Jewish people that had fled persecution in Europe and the Middle East, literally the day after declaring independence. If we're going to teach the story, let's teach the complete story.

5. Lyrics for Somos Sur, Pages 264-269 a. Again, this is purely a Palestinian perspective, and will mislead students that
won't know of the history of Palestinian leadership calling for an end to terroristic violence, rejecting proposed solutions (including two-state solutions) for decades, and continuing to sympathize with terrorists, even providing lifetime
payments to the families of "martyred" terrorists.
My general thoughts: I think we can all agree that the purpose of Ethnic Studies is to promote understanding, belonging, and appreciation for one another. As a parent, I am sending my children to public schools largely because I want them to meet, appreciate, and befriend people different from them. I cannot however in good conscious allow my children to attend school where they and their classmates will only be presented with one side of the Israel-Palestine conflict. It is intellectually dishonest and very dangerous, particularly with idealistic, impressionable students. As a child, I was ridiculed and bullied for being a Jewish American, including being called slurs like `kike' and people trivializing the Holocaust, even laughing about the idea of my family members being killed by the Nazis. I cannot fathom that my children will be (correctly) taught about so many targeted ethnic minorities, yet will be taught nothing about the historical and modern-day persecution of their own ethnicity. It is objectively wrong, and is counter to the purpose of ethnic studies. I come from an Iraqi Jewish family. Nearly my entire extended family three generations removed were slaughtered in the streets of Baghdad in the late 1940's simply because they were Jews. As a little girl my grandmother saw her uncles executed with guns in the streets in broad daylight. My remaining family, including my grandparents, left everything behind and fled to Israel with nothing. My grandfather was jailed and narrowly escaped execution.

This story is not unique among Jews � they have been hated and targeted throughout history, and sadly anti-Semitic rhetoric and attacks are on the rise across the globe, including the United States. Not only does this curriculum, in its current proposed state, do nothing to combat or even shine a light on that fact � by omitting it entirely, it is legitimizing anti-Semitism by not calling it out amongst all these other targeted minority groups. Lastly, I do find some irony in the implicit de-legitimization of Israel throughout this curriculum when Israel is in fact the sole Middle-Eastern nation championing LGBTQ and women's rights. In the spirit of belonging, acceptance and inclusion, this HAS to be mentioned. As a born and raised, California-loving parent who himself spent his entire life in public school, I urge this department to reconsider and amend this proposed curriculum to provide students with multiple perspectives on the issues, and challenge them to think analytically about them, as well as include the Jewish people as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racist hate. Thank you very much; your time and attention is sincerely appreciated from the bottom of my heart. Sincerely, Edan Rubin

There is no mention of how nowhere in the Middle East do women and the LGBTQ community have the rights, freedom and celebration that they do in Israel. First, there is a noticeable absence of anti-Semitism, despite the fact that Jews are a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racist rhetoric and attacks. its rise in the US and Europe
