From: Sobel, Ceevah F. Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 10:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Tony Thurmond Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I very much support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others.
I do not want knowledge of the American Jewish experience eliminated from my grandchildren's education or from any of his ethnically diverse classmates. In this era of rising antisemitism, especially on college campuses, combating this and all hate and fear of "the other" must begin before the university. Although a great deal of curriculum is devoted to Islamophobia, there is absolutely none devoted to the history and culture of Jews, or to the history of anti-Semitism. The one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish students may be stereotyped, accused of dual-loyalty, harassed and forced to face social litmus tests.
I urge you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Ceevah F. Sobel
