When I came to California in 1988 as a Reading Specialist, California schools were ranked near the top in the country.
I moved here from New Mexico. My principal asked how I planned to get up to speed, coming from such a low ranking education state (NM) to such a high one as California.
I quickly found out that phonics was not acceptable here. So when the first and second grade teachers sent me their kids who were not learning to read, I pulled out my phonics expertise and had them reading within the month. When the kids left my class, I hid the phonics teaching tools I had because I would have been fired for using phonics to actually teach children to read.
Their teachers were shocked. How did I teach them to read so quickly. I guess they had just gotten to the point where they were ready I always said. I couldn't actually tell them how I did it as it wasn't an accepted method of teaching in California.
Now California school ranks almost last in the country. This Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum can help expedite the rush to the bottom.
I'm off to Texas. Where reading, writing and math proficiency are still top priorities. At least the California kids will be proficient in Ethnic studies.....or maybe not since they won't be able to read it. Toni Seymour Novato, CA
