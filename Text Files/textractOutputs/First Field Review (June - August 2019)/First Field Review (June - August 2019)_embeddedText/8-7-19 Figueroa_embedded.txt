From: Tamar Figueroa Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 4:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern,
We commend the desire to promote diversity. However, due to the ideological uniformity of this material, the curriculum actually undercuts this purpose. This curriculum was created by people of one ideological background who are promoting their particular ideological view throughthis curriculum. Thus, it is not teaching students critical thinking skills by which they may competently evaluate the varied ideologies that they will encounter in their communities. Please choose a different curriculum that allows students to engage with and evaluate a variety of ideological approaches to these topics.
Sincerely, Daniel and Tamar Figueroa
