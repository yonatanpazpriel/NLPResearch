From: Avinoam Ben Dor Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 11:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum ("ESMC") for public school students.
Dear Sirs
As far as I understood, the curriculum includes a substantial section on Arab-Americans that devotes space to explicitly promote the antisemitic BDS movement and to present Israel negatively. The material is devoid of factual content and historical context.
May I take this opportunity to explain to your board what the BDS movement is all about:
BDS is not a movement that aims to merely criticize Israel's policies. Its purpose is the elimination of the sole Jewish state on the planet. Its modus operandi is economic warfare, which given the success of Israel's economy means it has been a colossal failure. Yet its strategic purpose is to legitimize discrimination against Jews and their state, as well as to stigmatize and isolate Israel's Jewish supporters. That is why BDS is not only a form of anti-Jewish bias that is indistinguishable from antisemitism, but also provides an easy explanation for why acts of antisemitism soon follow wherever the movement pops up.
Omar Barghouti, who was recently denied entry into the U.S. to promote the BDS movement he co-founded, has said, "Most definitely we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine. No Palestinian...will ever accept a Jewish state in Palestine."
The hypocrite, Omar Barghouti founder of BDS movement, claims that Israel is an apartheid State studied himself in Tel Aviv University: .Wikipedia

The BDS movement calls for isolating the world's largest Jewish community. It does so for two reasons. First, it seeks to build political support in the U.S. and throughout the West for the claim that Jews have no right to self-determination, and that Israel has no right to exist. And second, the BDS movement aims to turn Jews who support Israel's existence, (that is, approximately 90 percent of world Jewry) into evil Untouchables.
The agenda and goal of the BDS movement are of course inherently bigoted against Jews. Indeed, the BDS campaign is the most active, and the most powerful, antisemitic campaign in the Western world.
So how do BDS operatives prevent their cause from being treated as an intrinsically racist enterprise?

To avoid being recognized and treated like the bigots they are, BDS operatives have adopted multiple means to shield their nature and their goals.
First, they insist that they aren't boycotting Israel per se. They are boycotting the Israeli government and everyone who is "complicit" with it, (i.e., Jewish).
In other words, they aren't boycotting Israel, they are boycotting all Jewish Israelis and their Jewish counterparts abroad.
Second, BDS operatives say they aren't ostracizing Israel and Israelis per se. They are "critiquing" the Jewish state and its citizens. They aren't trying to shun Israelis from the public square or the marketplace by calling for them to be denied the right to study or teach or present their views freely while studying or teaching. BDS operatives are merely "critiquing" them when they picket their classrooms and work to get Jews kicked out of campus life.
BDS operatives aren't trying to bankrupt Israeli businesses when they call for universities and city councils to divest from stock in them or remove their products from store shelves and cafeterias. BDS operatives are merely "critiquing" certain policies of the Israeli government.
And BDS operatives aren't trying to relegate Israelis and their Jewish supporters to ghettos when they intimidate other groups into rejecting cooperation with them. Again, their actions are simply garden variety "critiques" that are eminently reasonable in an open society.
The BDS movement has two areas of operation: Western nations, and Israel.
In the West, BDS operatives use mob actions and intimidation to drive Israelis and their Jewish supporters out of the public square and popularize hatred of Israel and Jews who support it.
In Israel, BDS operations focus on political theater. Operatives use Israel, as well as Israelis and Palestinians, as props and backdrops to stage productions that present Israel and Israeli Jews as evil, and the Jewish state as unworthy of existence. In the past, through the pro-BDS International Solidarity Movement, they have even collaborated with suicide bombers.

Just as the Linda Sarsours and Farrakhans and Israel Apartheid Liarsand BDS bullies and IfNotNow traitors and the JStreet manipulators call against "humanizing Israelis," demonizing Israel, Israelis and her right for defense and peace, We must remind the world that we are not going anywhere. We are Israel, we are the Jewish nation, we are history, we are human, and we are here. Forever.

The BDS movement's goal is to cause economic, cultural, and political damage to all the people of Israel. It is a cowardly identification that shows no hint of courage to stand, in comparable situations, against China or Russia.

BDS recap by AIPAC
"BDS supporters ignore the regrettable actions of the Palestinian Authority which have made peace, and a better path for Palestinians, harder to achieve.
They ignore that PA President Mahmoud Abbas has for years refused to accept any Israeli offer for peace, and that today, the Palestinians are boycotting American and Israeli officials.
They ignore the ongoing attacks against Israelis or that PA leaders financially support the terrorists who commit them.
They ignore that the leaders of BDS have said they want Israel destroyed. "Most definitely, we oppose a Jewish state in any part of Palestine." -Omar Barghouti, BDS Co-Founder.
BDS supporters say they are for "human rights," yet they ignore the human rights abuses perpetrated by Palestinian leaders against their own people.

They ignore Hamas' continued use of Gazan civilians as human shields, including the firing of rockets from hospitals and schools.
They ignore the violent crackdown against Palestinians protesting dire living conditions in Gaza caused by Hamas.
They ignore that money and resources sent into Gaza to improve Palestinian lives is instead stolen by Hamas and used for weapons and building tunnels."

Another issue for your consideration, since 1992 after the Oslo Disaster, the P-A received $billions from different countries and organizations including the USA.
What have they done with all this generous contribution? Have they invested these funds in infrastructure, hospitals, waste water treatment plants, industry, homes, education?

If you still decide to go ahead with your curriculum, at least you can offer both sides of the coin.
Please do not forget the history of the conflict. There are many books that I can recommend:
History of the conflict summary
The Facts:
This section introduces historical events without providing any factual substance. The following are facts students need to know in order to have a basic understanding of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current Palestinian predicament:
What happened in 1947-48 that led to the Palestinian Arab dispersal?
1) No state of Palestine existed. Two states were proposed � a Jewish one and an Arab one in UN Resolution 181. The resolution was accepted by the Jews and rejected by the Arabs. Arab armies invaded with the stated goal of eradicating the Jewish state.
Resolution 242, passed after the 1967 war, forms the basis of a peaceful solution.
2) Most Palestinian Arabs who fled expected to return after the Jews had been defeated. Forcible removal of Arabs by Jewish armed groups was responsible for only a small portion of Palestinian Arab flight. For more, see Palestine Betrayed by Efraim Karsh and The Arab-Israeli Conflict: The Palestine War 1948 also by Efraim Karsh.

3) The Jews are indigenous people of the territory called Palestine. For much of its history it was known as Israel or Judea. The Jewish presence goes back several thousand years. The Arabs arrived as conquerors in the 7th century.
4) The Palestine Mandate was a creation of the League of Nations and administered by Britain. It included what is now Jordan in 78% of the total land area.
5) The leading Palestinian political figure of the first half of the 20th century was Haj Amin Husseini. He incited violence against Jews and Arabs who sought a peaceful compromise and he collaborated with the Nazis. After World War II ended, he returned to the Middle East and organized a campaign of violence against Jews. See The Mufti of Jerusalem: Haj-Amin elHusseini and National-Socialism by Jenny Lebel.
6) Fatah (1959) and the PLO (1964) were created before Israel took control of the West Bank and Gaza (1967). Their goal was to erase Israel. The Fatah General Congress in 2010 reaffirmed its commitment to violence and dismantling the Jewish state.
7) The chief obstacle to moving forward with a peaceful resolution is incitement and indoctrination to reject Israel and vilify Jews that is rampant in Palestinian media, schools, mosques and official messages to the public. Organizations like MEMRI and Palestinian Media Watch have documented on-going incitement to violence and hatred.
Sincerely
Ben Dor A.
