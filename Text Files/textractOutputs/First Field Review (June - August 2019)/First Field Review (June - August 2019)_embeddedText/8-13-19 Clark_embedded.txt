I have taught ethnic studies and politics at the college teacher and social studies and Spanish in K-12 for the last 16 years. I have informally been building a curriculum for ethnic studies for my various classes over this time and this draft is very similar to what I have used in the past. I think it is a very comprehensive start to implementing a real, applicable curriculum. Teachers can use this as a primer to create their classes. Letting teachers know that they have creative freedom in building their units is very critical. Along with the suggested list of concepts, I think that attaching a list of objectives/outcomes for teachers to go by so that they can alter and develop the curriculum according to their interests and needs would be helpful. This all points to the eventual need for standards and a fully developed framework for ethnic studies but as a draft this is very good.
For this project to do well in terms of public opinion and support, the critical thinking piece in the beginning of the draft is very important. Explaining to the public that this is the best way to develop college level critical thinking will be essential. Otherwise, people will be mired in the terminology that they feel is "Too PC." Get the public to understand that "Latina/o/x" and "Hxrstory" are terms of positionality and agency and we want student to think about them not just adopt them without consideration of what they mean. Allow concepts to be fluid and problematized in this way and it will seem more tenable to most folks who don't teach or engage with this material every day. The "TOO PC" attack worries me because it signals that perhaps people are missing the point- this is a draft and is meant to allow teachers to adapt it to their classroom contexts and students' needs. It will never be rigid or fixed nor should it be because that goes against the struggles inherent to the content!
Finally, parents will need some encouragement and assurance along these lines as well. The connection to common core standards and college readiness again or very important as well as the piece on teacher preparation which is present in the introduction portion. There will be debates as to what is missing and what is included but the bottom line is that this is a good foundation that can be built on. California needs to lead the way on teaching ethnic studies to our youth.
