I have reviewed your proposed curriculum and I am shocked, saddened and dismayed by the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum's (ESMC) manifest indifference, and even hostility, to the American Jewish experience and community. The curriculum erases American Jewish history by failing to include Jews in a meaningful way, and it neglects any discussion of anti-Semitism. Further, it incorporates harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes in its completely inappropriate and biased criticism of Israel in a curriculum intended to focus on American ethnic groups.
In this era of hate and intolerance, your one-sided criticism of Israel, along with the exclusion of any discussion of the contributions of Jewish Californians to the state and any discussion of anti-Semitism, both historically and currently, is not only misguided, it is harmful and shameful.
Please see my specific comments below for inaccuracies and blatant bias. I hope you will reconsider and make the necessary changes to the curriculum before it is presented to any students.
Page 1 omits a definition of Anti-Semitism; Page 2 includes a definition for BDS -- this shows blatant bias. There are several problematic topics on page 234: 4956 Line Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter 4957 Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel 4958 Comparative Border Stueis: Palestine and Mexico

There are several more problematic topics on page 242: the ESMC uses politically biased language to refer to the founding of Israel (lines 5157-61) On pages 268-269, lines 5802-5803, it uses the anti-Semitic trope of Jewish control of the media to baselessly accuse Israel of colonizing land.
