Gentlepersons:
I write today to urge major revisions. As the California Legislature Jewish Caucus wrote, "It would be a cruel irony if a curriculum meant to help alleviate prejudice and bigotry were instead to marginalize Jewish students and fuel hatred and discrimination against the Jewish community."
I served two terms as an elected member of the Palo Alto Unified School District Board of Education, including two years as its president. Your proposed curriculum is an affront to educational integrity and truth. I need not cite specific examples of its inaccuracies; you have been made aware of them by others. PAUSD hosts two of the nationally top-rated public high schools in the entire country, "Paly" and Gunn. We did not achieve those accolades by teaching revisionist history, lies, half-truths, selective facts, or otherwise distorting reality. Your work is important. Please revise it so that all Americans are treated fairly.
Respectfully,
Donald A. Way
