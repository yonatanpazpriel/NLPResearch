Re: Public Input Templateï¿½2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft

The purpose of this letter is to comment on the proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum May 2019 Draft.

No attempt will be made here to itemize particular items, line numbers, or specific verbiage contained in the document. The entire document, as summarized in Chapter 1. Introduction and Overview, is pure poison, and it is unnecessary to go beyond that for understanding these comments. The "model curriculum" (hereinafter referred to as the "plan") to be derived from or promoted by it represents a vile, offensive, and violently provocative attack on the white minority of California and should be dismissed without further consideration.

No more specificity is needed, other than to point out that the plan (as introduced in Chapter 1) represents viewpoints that are symptomatic of an already existing hostile environment towards white people among its framers and will exacerbate that existing hostility or create additional hostility among school employees, including teachers, and students that will have adverse impacts on white students in particular in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended. In addition, because the plan bluntly and brazenly declares its intent to promote the interests of non-white groups or ethnicities while disregarding those of white groups or ethnicities, it violates the express provisions of Constitutional Amendment 14, which mandate equal protections under the law regardless of race or color.
Furthermore, the plan fails to address anti-Semitism or the concerns of the Jewish community at all, thus excluding Jewish people in such a way that promotes additional hostility towards them. In addition, this approach of marginalizing Jewish people excludes the lessons of recent and ancient history that are the most pivotal, or among the most pivotal, for understanding the origins of racial/ethnic/religious discrimination and hatred, as well as ignoring the ways oppressed groups adapt to mistreatment. Thus, the plan fails as an educational one that supposedly seeks to enhance understanding and reduce discrimination and hate. On the contrary, the plan seeks to arbitrarily or capriciously advance the causes of particular racial/ethnic groups that are favored by its framers to the detriment of other groups not so favored. State law mandating such a plan is worse than irrelevant in this case; it is, in itself, an egregious violation of the Constitution and law that has given rise to this disgustingly divisive and subversive plan.
The plan reveals a gravely toxic level of misunderstanding by its framers and others responsible for it on critical issues of race, color, or ethnicity. Therefore, they should be removed from their positions, regardless of whether those positions are paid or unpaid, elected, appointed, or acquired through any other process, as they do not represent a necessary cross section of California citizens.

Sincerely, Mark Osokow, Woodland Hills, CA
