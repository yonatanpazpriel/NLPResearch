Hello,
As a citizen of United States of America and a resident of California, I would like to express my shock and unbelief with the new ethnic studies curriculum draft for 2020. The curriculum is little more than an agenda to minimize the role and centrality of parents in the life of their children and the denigration of the human dignity as a whole (with such term as "anthropocentrism" being used to describe our relationship to the world around us). Please stop trying to convert our high schools into social experimental projects.
Sincerely,
Vadim Chepurny
