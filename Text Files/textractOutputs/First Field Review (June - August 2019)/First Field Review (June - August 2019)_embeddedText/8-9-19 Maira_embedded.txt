From: Sunaina Maira Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 11:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment in support of Arab American Studies in CA curriculum
Hi: Please see the attached public comment in support of including Arab American studies in the CA ethnic studies curriculum.
I am a professor at UC Davis specializing in Arab American studies and my research and teaching over the past 20 years have focused on Arab American communities, including here in the Bay Area. I am really happy to hear that Arab American studies is being included in the proposal for the curriculum for the reasons I state in the form, attached.
Arab American studies is a rapidly growing field with very important contributions to interdisciplinary ethnic studies scholarship on a range of issues. I am myself the founder of a West Asian American Studies section in the Association of Asian American Studies to support scholarship in this field.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further information or resources.
With every best wish, Sunaina Maira

� I support the objectives listed on page 233 which clearly outline the benefits of teaching the diverse history of Arabs and Arab Americans as a way to challenge xenonophobia and discrimination and to create a welcoming environment for marginalized students.
I am an ethnic studies scholar with a specialization in Arab American (and Muslim American) studies. My scholarship focuses on Arab American communities in the Bay Area which are understudied despite their long presence in the region. Arab American students I teach and mentor generally feel invisibilized on campus, and since 9/11 have also experienced discrimination, profiling and surveillance on and off campus. They belong to a group that often falls between the cracks of ethnic studies programs and student affairs categories and so receive little institutional support and few resources, despite their struggles with racism and the censorship of their histories. Given the heightened Islamophobia and Arabophobia stoked by the Trump administration, it is imperative that this knowledge is imparted through the curriculum. It is long overdue!
