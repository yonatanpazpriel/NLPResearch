From: Emily Barsh Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 12:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: resending OBJECTION TO PROPOSED CURRICULUM, to include Mr. McDonald
This is extraordinarily troubling. I urge you to reconsider. Make no mistake about how this will lead to further unrest, suffering, and hate crimes directed at Jews, globally. You must realize that Israel has a right to defend itself against a terrorist-run government whose sole policy is to inflict poverty upon its own people (as do Communist states like North Korea). The Palestinian authority incites hatred and envy toward Israeli Jews. Israel was a reaction to the Fascism which is recycling itself today, due to radical propaganda. THIS is what is causing violence in the Middle East. You guys know it.
Please do not go forward with this 'optional' curriculum. In my fact-based opinion, it is hate speech and dangerous propaganda. I get why you think this is okay. But an email such as this is no place for a polemic.
This is also a civil rights and taxation-without-representation issue.
It could cost many folks in Sacramento many votes.
Thank you for your attention to this.
