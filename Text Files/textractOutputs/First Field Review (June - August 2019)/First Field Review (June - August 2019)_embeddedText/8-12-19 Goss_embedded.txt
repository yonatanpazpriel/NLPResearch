Page 242 � you are perpetrating another myth about Jewish control of the media. This bias does not teach anything except hate and bigotry. Page 1 � It's shameful to omit the definition of antisemitism.
Page 2 � you defined BDS but not antisemitism?
Page 234 � Topic 4956 � Promoting Palestine and Black Lives Matter while not educating our students as to antisemitism is misleading and hurtful to the Jewish community. Page 234 � Topic 4957 � Supporting the BDS movement is not what should be taught to our students. Teaching our students to understand both sides of this conflict is what is necessary.

Page 234 � Topic 4958 � comparing the border wall in Israel, to protect men, women and children from suicide bombers is VERY different from building a wall between the US and Mexico. The comparison is laughable, at best.
