The number of references to Palestinians seems out of proportion to their population in California. An article in Wikipedia, for example, estimates that there are a total of 5722 Palestinians in California. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestinians_in_Los_Angeles. Nevertheless, I counted 21 references to Palestinians in Chapter 2, including references on p. 35 line 684, p 234 lines 4956 and 4958, p. 237 line 5030, p. 241 line 5138, 242 lines 5158-5161, pp. 247-48, p. 256 line 5481, p. 259 line 5561, p. 263 line 5656, p. 265 line 5719, p. 266 line 5750, p.268 line 5792, and p. 269 line 5821. The Iranian American and Armenian American populations, for example, are much larger but receive almost no discussion.

The discussion of Palestinians frequently includes references to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict. See p. 234 line 4957, p. 237 line 5030, p. 241 line 5138, p. 242 line 5160, and p. 268 line 5802. While discussion of the complex history and ethics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict could have educational value in the context of a course that analyzed other complex political conflicts (e.g. the Catalan and Basque struggle for independence and autonomy in Spain, or the Kurdish struggles for independence and autonomy in Turkey, Iraq, Syria, and Iran), discussion of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict seems inappropriate in an Ethnic Studies course, where the complex historical and ethical considerations cannot be discussed fairly and in depth. If there is going to be discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, it should be fair and present both sides. Instead, many of the references in the chapter present only the Palestinian side. For example, p. 234 line 4957 refers to calls to "Boycott, Divest and Sanction Israel." In addition, p. 242 line 5160 refers to the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 as the "Naqba" (Catastrophe), the Palestinian way of referring to that war, rather than as "Israel's War of Independence," which is the way of Israeli's view it. Similarly, p. 268 line 5802 refers to "an Israeli colony." It is unclear to me what this rap verse is talking about, but to refer to Israeli "colonies" is to take a side in this complex dispute. All of these one-sided references should be deleted. The reference on p. 241 line 5138 to "modern states of Syria, Lebanon, and Palestine/Israel" is inaccurate. There is no modern state of Palestine. One could argue (and I would agree) there should be, but it does not currently exist. At the very least, the existence of a Palestinian state is disputed. For example, it is not recognized by the US and is not a member of the U.N. Referring to Palestine as a "modern state" is again to take sides in a complex dispute in a way that is inappropriate in an Ethnic Studies course.
