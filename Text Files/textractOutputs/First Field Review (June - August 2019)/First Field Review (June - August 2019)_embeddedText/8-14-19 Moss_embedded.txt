From: Jane Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 5:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New curriculum
I object to the new curriculum for the following concerns:
-Jews have been excluded from ethnic groups mentioned -Anti-semitism has been excluded from hate crimes/discrimination even though half of religious based hate crimes in the US are against Jews -The divisive DBS movement which seeks to erase the state of Israel is included with no balancing perspective -A song with language that suggests Jews control the media is included
