This curriculum is anti-semitic. Not only does it instruct teachers to promote antisemitic tropes in order to discredit Israel as a legitimate entity, it notably excludes anti-semitism from its exhaustive survey of bigotry at a time when anti-semitic attacks are peaking in America.

In so doing, this curriculum draft extolls a worldview in which Jews� anywhere� are not a minority, not othered, and not under threat, nobut a generic oppressor to be overcome. It privileges other minority groups over Jews as if we are not "deserving" of sympathy or understanding.

Jewish Californians are already under threat. Adopting this draft will make that threat state policy. And if there is a place for discussion concerning Israel in California's high schools, it should be in history class, not ethnic studies.
