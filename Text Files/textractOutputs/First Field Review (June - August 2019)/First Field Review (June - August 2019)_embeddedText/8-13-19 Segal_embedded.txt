From: Barbara Segal Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 7:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I've read much of the proposed curriculum, although it often makes no sense. My biggest concern is your treatment of Israel, anti-semitism, and BDS. It certainly doesn't serve the students to portray Israel as a hateful place deserving of scorn. Also, your lack of education regarding Jews as a group is shocking. No other group has been as persecuted, displaced and murdered like the Jews over the centuries. I respectfully request that you revise your curriculum to more fairly represent all ethnic groups.
