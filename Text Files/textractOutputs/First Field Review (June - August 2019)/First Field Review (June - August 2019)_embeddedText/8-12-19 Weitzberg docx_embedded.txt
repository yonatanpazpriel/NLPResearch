P 232 The course as written has a number of serious problems and appears to have been written with a biased and incomplete view of issues of new immigrants in the US since its birth. Line 4942 attributes the problems in part to US imperialism, but I am unaware of any US colonies in the Middle East or Arab world. The focus appears to be on the views Muslim Arabs and possibly on Palestinian Muslim Arabs while ignoring the history of the Middle East, the poor treatment of Christian Arabs by their Muslim neighbors and the expulsion of Jews from Arab countries after living there for millennia. The identification of Arabs as people of color seems to be a way to garner sympathy. Historically, the roles of Arabs in the Slave trade could be included. Line 4952 Terrorism Against Arabs should be balanced by terrorism by Palestinian Arab terrorists including plane hijackings and Olympic massacre. Line4957 Why is Call for BDS against Israel included, when there is no similar call against other countries whose civil rights records against some Arabs are far worse than Israel's.

Line 4958 Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico. There is no comparison. Years of terrorism, suicide attacks, armed cross-border attacks and weapons smuggling require different measures between Israel and Palestinian areas contrasted with the peaceful border between the US and Mexico.

Lines 5157-5161 The entire concept of Nakba needs an historical context. The migration of Arabs from what is now Israel was self-inflicted by the Arabs. They refused to accept the UN and seven Arab countries invaded the Jewish areas. Arabs who stayed are now citizens of Israel, those who left became stateless. The entire Arab-American course needs to be redone placing it in the historical context of problems experienced by most immigrants to the US since its inception, be they Germans, Irish, Italians, Chinese, or Jews. Arabs disserve no special consideration because of the color of their skin. They disserve no special consideration because they tried to destroy Israel or sided with the Nazis in WWII. Students should be told the full story, not a one-sided story to promote a specific narrative.

It would be far better to just eliminate this curriculum than to try to fix it.
