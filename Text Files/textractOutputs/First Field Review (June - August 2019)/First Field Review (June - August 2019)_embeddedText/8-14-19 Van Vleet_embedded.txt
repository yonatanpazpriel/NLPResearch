From: Susan Van Vleet Consultants, Inc.ï¿½ Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 4:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
Years ago I moved our family and our business out of a town in Colorado because they banned The Diary of Anne Frank from the library shelves.
Now, in my adopted State of California, similar things are happening. The current proposed curriculum does not include Anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry and encourages boycotts against Israel.
This seems rather short sighted at a time when all the data points to a up tick in Antisemitism all over an in California.
Please do not accept a curriculum that omits anti-semitism as a form of bigotry and espouses anti-semitic actions.
