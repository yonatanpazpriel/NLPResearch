There are many things wrong with this curriculum � not the least of which is defining capitalism as a form of power and oppression rather than the system that has done more to raise people out of poverty than any other in the history of the world. Further, there is a strong undercurrent of identity politics that will only serve to drive these students further apart into their respective "racial camps". This curriculum lacks a grounding in logic and critical reasoning, substituting instead for vague language centered on social justice topics du jour.
