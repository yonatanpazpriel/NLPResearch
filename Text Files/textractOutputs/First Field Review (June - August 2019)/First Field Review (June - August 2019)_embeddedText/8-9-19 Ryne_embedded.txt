Hi,
It has been brought to my attention that an ethnic studies curriculum is being purposed for 2024-2025 academic year. This appears to attempt to put anti-semetic language into classroom studies by:
Encouraging teachers to highlight BDS and a pro BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives. (pg234)
Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico. (pg 234)
Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country. (pg 237)
Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives. (pg 242)
Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it to manipulate the public-a common anti-semetic slur.
The proposed curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the sizable Jewish community as an ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. With anti-semetism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.
