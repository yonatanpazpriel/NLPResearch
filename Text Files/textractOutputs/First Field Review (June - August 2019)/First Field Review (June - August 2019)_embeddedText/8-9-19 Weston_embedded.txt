Glossary and Bibliography, page 2, lines 30 � 40 refers to an organization that promotes the goal of eliminating Israel as a Jewish state and insists on blaming the conflict entirely on one side � Israel, without willingness to acknowledge any wrongdoing on the part of Palestinians. BDS promotes an agenda of hate and exclusion toward a single ethnic group, rather than one of tolerance and inclusion. Chapter 2: Sample Course Models, pages 234, 237, 242, 256, and 264-269. There is a glaring omission of any mention whatsoever about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Such lessons should be added to the curriculum so that there is a fair and balanced point of view available. As a parent I am concerned that my children receive fair and balanced information based on a full understanding of the facts, as opposed to one-sided skewed information that favors one group and disparages another.
