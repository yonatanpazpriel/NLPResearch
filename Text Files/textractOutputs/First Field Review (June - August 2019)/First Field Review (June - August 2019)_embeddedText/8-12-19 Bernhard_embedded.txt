Dear friends, I am writing to share my concern regarding the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. I am an employee of LAUSD, I graduate of LAUSD schools, and a former LAUSD parent. I also happened to be a member of the Los Angeles Jewish community. Support of Israel has long been a bipartisan American value. Recently, the far left intersectionality movement has taken on the Palestinians as the cause of the day. Israel is America's greatest ally and the only democracy in the Middle East. They are singled out time and again by anti-Semitic and anti-Zionist forces. Like any country, including our own, Israel is not perfect. However, ignoring anti-Semitism and championing the claims of the BDS movement would be an embarrassment intellectually and morally. I find myself often defending the district and believe ethnic studies and how it relates to American history is a wonderful idea. Please don't let the fringe left shape this new curriculum.
