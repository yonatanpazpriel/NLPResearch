This is one of the worst proposed course guide I have ever seen. It reads like a left leaning propaganda sheet. I don't think brain washing our children in this way is good for California or the country. California is already in disarray thanks to this Socialist Democrates propaganda and policies. This is just a nother tactic to divide people. This should not be a model for our children here.
