From: Scarano Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 10:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Comment on draft Ethnic Studies Curriculum
California Department of Education To Whom It May Concern:
The draft Ethnic studies curriculum should not be approved as written and should be sent back to the Committee for revision. The Draft's list of hatred against oppressed minority groups fails entirely to mention any discussion of anti-semitism, despite the fact that according to the California Attorney General, there were more hate crimes against Jews in California in 2018 than there were against any other group. If the goal of an ethnic studies curriculum is meant to foster understanding among students of the plight and suffering of minority or ethnic groups, then the Committee has fallen woefully short of this goal in failing to address anti-semitism. In addition, the Committee includes in the Draft certain organizations and source materials as fair, balanced and legitimate sources of information, even though some of these sources are known to promote propaganda and division instead of understanding.
PLEASE send the draft Curriculum back to the Committee for revision addressing the above issues and enlist additional Committee members, as needed, to represent the interests of ALL California public school students. Our students' education is too important to allow the document as written to serve as a blueprint for Ethnic Studies.
Thank you for your consideration.
M. Scarano
