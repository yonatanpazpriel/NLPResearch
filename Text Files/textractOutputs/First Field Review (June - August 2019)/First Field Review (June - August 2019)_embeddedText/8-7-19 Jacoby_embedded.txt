Pages 234, 237, 242, and 268 � There is no such thing/country as Palestine currently and no such thing a "Palestinian" Arab back in 1948. The term is a relatively modern invention. If ever there is a peaceful settlement, there could be a "Palestine" someday; but not presently. For an attempt to teach the effect of oppression on non-white communities in the U.S., there is a lot of biased judgement regarding Israel's role the middle east conflict. BDS is a tactic to engage Americans and other developed country citizens to support the Arab cause which is to ultimately "push all the Jews to the sea". (This has been openly stated this way many times.) The source of this tactic is due to resentment of having a Jewish state, Israel, in the middle east, period. "Apartheid conditions" is a politically-charged falsehood spread to incite an emotional response to support the Arab cause. If BDS was a tactic used against multiple countries, it should be taught. But currently, it is only used against one country by certain people; this screams of bias, a cornerstone of discrimination, and ultimately, turns to oppression.
