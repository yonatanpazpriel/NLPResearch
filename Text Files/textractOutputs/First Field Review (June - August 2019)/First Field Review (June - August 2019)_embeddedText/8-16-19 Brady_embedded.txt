From: Jim Brady Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 6:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies
To whom it may concern:
I read your current guidelines, that you might re-work. May I suggest that during your deliberation that you consider including the Jewish people and not only their historical struggles but even as it goes on today. From the guidelines, it appears that it is suggested to teachers that their curriculum include teaching about groups that are anti-semites and very critical of Jews. My question is who drafted these guidelines and what was their motivation? When drafting guidelines on ethnic studies, how can the Jewish History be omitted? The failure to include the Jewish struggle is unconscionable. However, the drafters then double-down, showing their true colors and include anti-semite ethnic groups.
I strongly suggest that when you rethink your guidelines, that you remain as objective as you can, instead of exhibiting your true feelings.
