To Whom It May Concern;
As a tax payer, I am really concerned about what type of education you are preparing for my grandson and other children. Teaching that Capitalism is Racist??? Insane!!
Capitalism is not at all racist. Are you completely unaware of the number of billion dollar Corporations owned by African-Americans? I guess that means they are racist because they are not Caucasian, or Hispanic or Asian?
Wait, there are also billion dollar Corporations owned by Latino-Hispanics that are growing rapidly. Racist??
What about the billion dollar Corporations owned by Asian Americans? All of these ethnic owned Corporations provide hundreds of thousands jobs to ALL races.
All students should be encouraged to dream big and have the accomplishments of every race spotlighted not shamed. Without capitalism we would all just settle for no hope. I do realize that not everyone is called to own a Corporation and that is perfect also. They can have their dreams and passions nurtured. Do not shame those students who have a vision of building something that could provide jobs for others and have a love of creating and business.
Whoever the person was in your department that thought of this concept, under the guise of ethnic studies, should be fired. They have lost touch with the world. And you are seriously going to teach that fabrication to students? Why don't you just teach them how to apply for welfare now and get it over with, because you are dream killers if you pass on such falsehoods.
You should all be ashamed.
