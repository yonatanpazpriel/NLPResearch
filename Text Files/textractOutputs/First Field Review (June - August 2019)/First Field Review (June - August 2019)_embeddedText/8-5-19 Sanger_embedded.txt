Capitalist systems are dominant in the Western world and continue to spread. Over time, capitalist countries have experienced consistent economic growth and an increase in the standard of living. Capitalism provides better products and innovation through competition, disperses wealth to all productive people, promotes pluralism and decentralization of power, creates strong economic growth and yields productivity and prosperity that greatly benefit society.
Captialism is our best hope! It may have its challenges, but it certainly outperforms its competition. Racism is not the result of capitalism, racism is the result of a nation, no longer "under God", no longer living by the Golden Rule, "Love your neighbor as yourself!" Capitalism is for productive people, capitalism is for responsible people.
