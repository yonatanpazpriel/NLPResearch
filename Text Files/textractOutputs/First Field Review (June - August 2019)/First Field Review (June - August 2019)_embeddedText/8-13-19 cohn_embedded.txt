Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
With the rise of Anti-Semitism throughout this beloved country and state of ours, it was with shock and disappointment that I learned about the proposed new ethnic studies model curriculum (ESMC) with its omission of Jews as an oppressed minority group, its omission of Anti-Semitism as a form of discrimination, as as well as its implied or actual Anti-Semitic Tropes.
Like the Latinos in our country, I already fear the rise of this well-documented Anti-Semitism and the deaths of innocents that it has already brought, and fear for the safety of my family when we attend synagogue, and they attend their public schools.
The lack of curriculum about Anti-Semitism, coupled with substantial discussion of Islamophobia is inexplicable and unacceptable, since there are at least 3 times as many hate crimes in America against Jews as against Muslims.
Also, the curriculum supports the BDS Movement without balancing it with explanations related to opposing ideas about it, which curriculum guidelines require! This one-sided framing is harmful to Jewish students.
I am upset by the descriptions of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War using Palestinian terms only.
Jews should be included as a historically oppressed peoples.
The State of California must modify this curriculum to remove anti-Israeli bias and include education about Anti-Semitism and the Jewish community! A significant number of revisions are in order and must be made prior to implementation . The California Legislative Jewish Caucus has good recommendations. I hope the modifications will be made so that I can continue to support the mission of the curriculum to "build a shared understanding of ethnic groups' perspectives and engage minority students in school."
Sincerely yours, Judy Cohn
