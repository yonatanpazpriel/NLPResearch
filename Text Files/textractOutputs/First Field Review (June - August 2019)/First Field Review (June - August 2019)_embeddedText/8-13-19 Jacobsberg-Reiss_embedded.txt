Dear Kenneth McDonald,
I am a community member deeply concerned about the California Department of Education's proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. This letter is to confirm that I added my signature to the Israel-American Community's official complaint, and have submitted this complaint on my behalf.
The proposed coursework, as written, will turn California classrooms into discriminatory and hostile environments for the young people in our community. This curriculum endorses prejudice against Jewish, Israeli-American and Zionist students, and delegitimizes their heritage and identity. It will lead to harassment, bullying, and discrimination.
Moreover, it completely disregards the fact that in 2019, Jews are still ethnic minority and the hardships they endured throughout the years because of antisemitism. As someone who's family was deeply impacted by the Hollcaust, I always wonder if the Hollcaust can happen again. I still remember my grandmothers stroies, survivors, about what it was like to grow up in pre wwII Europe. I'm deeply worried that my children will need to endure similar discrimination.
This deeply biased curriculum has no place in our public schools, which should be forums for teaching respectful dialogue, understanding, and tolerance.
I ask that you respectfully consider putting a hold on the currently proposed curriculum, and meet our community leaders to discuss how to improve this deeply biased coursework, which would create a hostile environment for Israeli-American and Jewish-American students.
Thank you
Michal Jacobsberg-Reiss
