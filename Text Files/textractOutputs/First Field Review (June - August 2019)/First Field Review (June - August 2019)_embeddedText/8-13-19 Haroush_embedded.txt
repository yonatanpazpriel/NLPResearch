As a parent of 3 lausd students, and having been raised in the lausd schools myself please do not teach about hatred toward Israel and Jews.
This will ruin our country and the mere idea that you would have professionally trained staff even voice their hatred of others is mind blowing.
I grew up where Russia was the great enemy, but never did a teacher tell us not to visit Russia or that the people were terrible and we should boycott them.
Why a school district would teach intolerance and hatred is beyond words.
I share this blog post about what you are doing and feel that it explains the effects on our future to the exact point.
