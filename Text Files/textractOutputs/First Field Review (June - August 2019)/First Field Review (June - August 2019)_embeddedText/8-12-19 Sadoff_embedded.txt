From: Michal Sadoff Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 9:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tony Thurmond Subject: Stop - Reconsider - Revise -- The Ethic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply concerned about the lack of balance and misleading information in the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) I support the idea of teaching an ethnic studies class, but I urge you to make major revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus letter, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others. As written, it would cause great harm to our general student population who will be misinformed and be fed negative and false ideas about Israel, and about Jews.
The ESMC curriculum fails to discuss antisemitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism, and would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools. This is indefensible in light of rising antisemitism in America and especially on college campuses. The curriculum denigrates both Israel and Jews. The one-sided framing of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in the ESMC creates a scenario where it's likely that Jewish students may be stereotyped, accused of dual-loyalty, harassed and forced to face social litmus tests.
As a Jew, a parent, grandparent and as a psychotherapist for teens is a high school, I assert that this curriculum will particularly cause harm to Jewish students who will be subject to bullying based on this wrongheaded curriculum, and to all Jews who will be made to feel unwelcome and defensive in the community. The purpose of Ethnic Studies is to teach inclusion and empathy, not exclusion and hate.
Again, I urge you to do a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to correct these problems.
Thank you,
Michal Ruth Sadoff
