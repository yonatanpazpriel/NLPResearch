Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, It is great that you are developing new curriculum designed to encourage acceptance of differing races, religions and ethnicities for California students. Given the mass shootings we have just witnessed targeting Latino Americans, this is so important right now. However significant revisions are in order so that Jewish Californians are not left out. Anti Semitism is still a huge problem in this country as well as hate for the State of Israel which was founded after the slaughter of six million Jews. Please include the recommendations of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus and Stand With Us. Thank you for including all peoples who have faced discrimination and hate; please do not contribute to the marginalization of Jewish Californians. Fondly, Gail Michaelis-Ow Santa Cruz, CA
