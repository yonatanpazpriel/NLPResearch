From: Andrea Corney Sent: Sunday, August 11, 2019 12:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ESMC Increases my Personal Fear of Anti-Semitism
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am deeply concerned about what I'm reading about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. A good part of my work as a lecturer at Stanford University involves teaching about and facilitating conversations around diversity, so I'm very supportive of expanding ethnic studies. As a Jewish American I am personally frightened by the rise in anti-semitic attacks in recent years. I fear that this new curriculum will feed the narratives that perpetuate anti-semitism.
The Israeli Palestinian conflict is a tough subject. The Palestinians have suffered and their experience deserves to be told, but to do that without giving equal weight to all sides and by demonizing Israel and all Jews is not in keeping with the stated goals of the new curriculum.
I know there are a lot of competing requests from different constituencies. Please take a step back and reconsider the unintended consequences of this aspect of the new curriculum
Sincerely,
Andrea Corney Los Altos Hills, CA
