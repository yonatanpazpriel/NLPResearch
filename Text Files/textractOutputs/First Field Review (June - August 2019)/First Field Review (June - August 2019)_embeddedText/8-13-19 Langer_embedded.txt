From: Rebekah Langer Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 2:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject:
I am writing to protest the adoption by the Department of Education of its proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The proposed curriculum is objectionable because it is both anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. It portrays Linda Sarsour, who is well known for public hatred of Israel, as a positive role model. It legitimizes the false description of Israel as an "apartheid"state. It encourages teachers to use anti-Israel songs to promote hatred. Furthermore, the curriculum fails to include Jews as an ethnic minority. This curriculum would result in a climate of fear, harassment and intimidation and would incite hatred and harm against Jews.
Respectfully yours,
Rebekah L. Langer
