I have read through the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. I strongly believe ethnic studies belong in the California school system. I am alarmed, however, by the lack of material about the Jewish experience. Historically, U.S. Jews, like other ethnic minorities have struggled against discrimination from immigration laws, hate speech and restrictions from joining organizations or home-ownership. Today, we see an upswing in anti-Semitic hate crimes.
Please reconsider your proposed curriculum to include a study for understanding the Jewish experience and the ill effects of antiSemetism.
Sincerely, Judith Klapper
