Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Page 1, I find unacceptable the omission of term anti-Semitism, as this is an important concept that students need to learn, both in the context of history, such as the history of WWII and events leading to dehumanization of Jews in Germany, as well as in the context of current events, such as attacks on US synagogues. Page 2, I object to the inclusion of the BDS movement (lines 30-40), as it is not relevant to the experience of ethnic groups in the United States. Further, it makes comparison of the state of Israel to that of the former apartheid government of South Africa based on a one-sided narrative provided by the BDS movement itself. Page 2, the definition of Capitalism is accompanied by a socialist-inspired narrative that falsely portrays Capitalism as being detrimental to minorities and Native people. This narrative is highly questionable, and I request deletion of lines 44 through 47. Page 242 � the narrative provided on this page paints a one-sided picture that portrays a complex set of issues surrounding the creation of the state of Israel and focuses exclusively on Arab refugees, while completely ignoring expulsion and killing of Jews from Arab countries during the same period of time.
