Dear CRIFD Personnel, State Assemblymember Cooper, and State Senator Pan,
I am a mother of several CA public school students. Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for the California Department of Education to merely mandate a re-write of the current draft's curriculum the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to prevent any future attempts to hijack our state's educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Warm regards, Jolan Rosenthal
