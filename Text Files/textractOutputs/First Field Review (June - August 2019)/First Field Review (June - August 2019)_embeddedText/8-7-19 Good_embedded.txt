Concerned (BDS) Movement against Israel. It claims the purpose of BDS is to

Citizen

"establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions." It

then parrots more BDS talking points while offering no critical

perspectives about this campaign of hate, which seeks to end Israel's

Introduction

Introduction � States that "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents

an opportunity for teachers to...enable students to develop a deep

appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication

of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does

not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews

only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish

people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this

curriculum is deeply disappointing.

General

I am deeply disturbed by the this model curriculum currently being

reviewed by The State of California, which openly promotes hateful

boycotts against Israel and omits antisemitism as a form of bigotry. I am

appalled that an educational effort meant (I would hope) to teach

students about diversity includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable

ethnic minority and frequent target of racism.As a parent and a California

resident, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and

tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division.
