From: Melissa Lieberman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:37 AM To: SBE Subject: Anti Semitic Rhetoric in California Schools
Hello,
It is absolutely disgusting the allowance of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel curriculums in California public schools. I thought California preached the ideals of acceptance and progressivism? Being anti-Israel directly goes against those values. How do you not see the contradiction? How can you claim to be inclusive and accepting of all races, when you're flat out demonizing Jews. This makes you no better than the Nazi regime. Being Anti-Israel is the same thing as being Anti-Semitic.
I was already planning to send my children to private school, but I can't believe my tax dollars are going to towards teaching children to hate Jews.
I urge you to reconsider adding Anti-Semitic/Anti-Israel curriculums to California Schools.
Thank you,
Melissa, a concerned Jew
