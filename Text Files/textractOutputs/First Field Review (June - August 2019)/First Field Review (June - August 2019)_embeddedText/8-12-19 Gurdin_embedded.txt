Dear CRIFD Personnel and Chairperson Chao:
As a California resident and taxpayer who is a UCLA alumnus who has been a Visiting Scholar in the Departments of Sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a Research Associate in its Department of Anthropology; as a parent who served as the Representative to the Gifted and Talented Educational for Robert Louis Stevenson Elementary School and A. P. Giannini Middle School of the San Francisco Unified School District; as the Parent Student Teacher Association volunteer Wellness Coordinator for Lowell High School in San Francisco; and as a parent of a graduate of UCSD and UCI, I am deeply troubled by the omission of information about American Jews, the shocking use of anti-Semitic stereotypes, and the overt bias against Israel in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). It is shocking that if AB 331 is approved by the California state legislature, every high school student would be required to take an ethnic studies course based on the ESMC before graduating. As you know, eighty-three civil rights, human rights, religious and educational organizations share similar concerns to mine about the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
I strongly urge you to prevent any future attempts to hijack California's educational curricula by insuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group, or individual.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Cordially,
J. Barry Gurdin, Ph.D. Joseph Barry Gurdin
