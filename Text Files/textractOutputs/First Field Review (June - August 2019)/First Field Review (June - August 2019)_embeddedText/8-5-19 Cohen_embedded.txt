From: Nazanin Lahijani Cohen Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 1:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public comment on proposed curriculum
To whom it may concern,
It is certainly time for education reform in California. And emphasis on the marginalized are also absolutely in order.
However, the proposed curriculum is NOT ACCEPTABLE.
The proposed curriculum is biased and politicized content. By providing a one-sided account of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the BDS movement, this curriculum is indoctrinating students into a particular side of politics. By aligning (and maligning) capitalism (an economic system that has helped make the US the incredible nation it is) with deplorable behavior such as white supremacy and racism, by categorizing them equally as "forms of power and oppression," the proposed curriculum is definitely pushing a vary particular political agenda - and not teaching historical content in an unbiased manner, as it should.
This curriculum is not acceptable and should not be accepted.
Sincerely,
Nazanin Lahijani Cohen, Esq.
