I am truly inspired by 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum being presented here. I am excited to see the Ethnic Studies program grow within your school district, as those of us in San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) have been doing the same work in our city. As a long-time teacher, I have seen the short and long term impacts of Ethnic Studies curriculum on students and community here in SFUSD. Ethnic Studies theory provides an impressive level of academic rigor for teachers to work with. Our students have been incredibly prepared for college. They often return to tell me that their exposure Critical Liberation Theory, Critical Literary Theory (also known as Critical Lenses), and learnings about systems of oppression, have greatly benefited them within their first year in college. They find that they are not only prepared, but able to engage in the work with a degree of confidence that many of their peers were not.

I am an English teacher by training, but in the past I have also taught English as a Second Language, Social Studies, and Ethnic Studies. I have seen how Ethnic Studies frameworks provide a foundation through which young people can truly

come to understand themselves and view their own personal, familial, cultural, and national histories from critical perspectives. I find that they practice deep introspection, they circumnavigate history and current events � asking how each side might be implicated, affected, and contributing to the issue.

In particular, I want to commend the effort to include our Arab and ArabAmerican students in the curriculum precisely because they are so often not included and misrepresented in our school books and texts to this day. I am actually part of a current review board to diversify the list of official texts taught in SFUSD high school literature classes as of last school year. We are making a serious effort to pay attention to identity groups and histories that are often missing. One such group is the Arab diaspora. I am proud to say that amongst the many texts we have been reviewing are a range of authors that identify as Arab, of mixed-Arab descent, female-bodied, LGBTQQI, Muslim, and stories that talk about the complexity of all these identities precisely because the Arab community is as diverse as any other, nor is the Muslim community easily boxed in. We have the opportunity as school districts in California to truly be at the forefront of a movement to create safe, just, classrooms where intellectual curiosity encouraged and intellectual discomfort can make room for genuine learning. This is the challenge: to make schools that teach to the diversity of our student body, but without shying away from taking a stand for equal human rights and humanization of all people. This means that the teaching and the texts selected for our humanities classrooms should actively challenge stereotypes and simplistic retellings of history.

I hope that your school district elects to move forward with the inclusion of Ethnic Studies as outlined in the curriculum proposed and I look forward to seeing how our school districts can collaborate in the future!
