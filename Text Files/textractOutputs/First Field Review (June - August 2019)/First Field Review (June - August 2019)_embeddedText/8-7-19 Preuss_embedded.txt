Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I strongly support the inclusion of Arab American studies as part of the ethnic studies curriculum in California. I believe that key concepts and definitions such as those found on pg. 3 of Chapter 1 and pg. 19 of Chapter 3's sample course outlines are imperative for teaching California's students about xenonophobia and discrimination. This kind of curriculum is necessary for understanding how the historical lineages of power and oppression connect to events in today's society, and creating a more inclusive classroom for all students, particularly those who have been traditionally marginalized by the nation's education system.
