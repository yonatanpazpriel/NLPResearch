I recently learned of the proposed draft and went to the website to make sure the original report I saw was not biased. After reviewing 300 pages of documentation I was stunned. All 4 of my children attended local public schools and received excellent educations. They actually were instructed in basic sciences, English, math, etc. All did well and attended and graduated from four year universities.
Having seen this model outline of Ethnic Studies I cannot believe that this type of propaganda extreme politicalization of any school program would even be proposed, much less initiated. Given the lousy results as reflected in all test results for California students, wasting class time on these over the top programs designed to inculcate young student into the politically correct California thought police programs is ridiculous.
Yes, I recognize this email may sound like an anti-progressive person. Just so you know, I am a registered Democrat, an undergraduate alum of UC Berkeley with a law degree from UCLA. Without the opportunity to attend California colleges I have no idea where I would be today. Neither of my parents ever went to college and I am the first member of my family to obtain a college degree. I am deeply appreciative of what the California educational system offered me but this politicalization of high school education is pathetic.
