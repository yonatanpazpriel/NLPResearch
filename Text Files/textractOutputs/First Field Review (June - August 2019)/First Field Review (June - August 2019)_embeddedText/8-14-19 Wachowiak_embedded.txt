From: Susan Wachowiak Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 3:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
My name is Susan Wachowiak and I spent my entire professional career as an educator in California, as a teacher, as an administrator, as a curriculum writer and as a curriculum consultant. My career work centered around the integration of students from many ethnicities and social-economic backgrounds. I wrote curriculum for Social Studies programs as well as other subjects. And I have to say I was VERY disheartened to read what the proposed ethnic studies curriculum is all about. The curriculum that I read was such a divisive curriculum. Having worked with students from 4th to 12th grades on getting along and working together, I thought the studies as proposed would have the exact opposite effect. We need unification not division. I believe we should be fostering a strong sense of American identity. We are all Americans, no matter what color or culture, and we need to stress the fact that even though we all come from and honor different backgrounds and cultures, we are uniting to form one great nation for all of our citizens.
I strongly disagree with the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum!
Sincerely,
Susan Wachowiak Chula Vista, California
