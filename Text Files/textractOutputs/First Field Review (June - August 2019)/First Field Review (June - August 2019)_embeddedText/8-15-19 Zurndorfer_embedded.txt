Dear Ms. Soomin Chao Chair, Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education I'm a grandparent to four children who attend schools in California. I am very upset by the indifference and even hostility to the American Jewish community. The proposed curriculum neglects any discussion of anti-Semitism, which as you know still exists in this Country. There are harmful anti-Jewish stereotypes which are completely inappropriate and its biased criticism of Israel. Wasn't the focus supposed to be on American ethnic groups? Please, implement all necessary revisions to meet a standard by including Jewish culture and history. Teach students that anti-Semitism is wrong and does not belong in this culture. Also, please avoid irrelevant and inflammatory comments about Israel. Here is a quote from Assembly member Jesse Gabriel, Vice Chair of the California Legislative Jewish Caucus: "We cannot accept a curriculum that erases the Jewish community, fails to acknowledge antisemitism, and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Jewish stereotypes in our public schools. We're going to do everything in our power to get it fixed." I believe he said it all! Thank you for taking the time to read my email. Sincerely, Vera Zurndorfer (a worried grandparent)
