The proposed curriculum is biased. Instead of promoting inclusivity, this curriculum encourages divisiveness by exploiting the crisis on the border, denigrating the memory of 9/11, and manipulating the struggles of African Americans to deliver anti-Israel and antisemitic messages with suggested coursework such as Comparative Border Studies: Palestine and Mexico; Direct Action Front for Palestine and Black Lives Matter; Call to Boycott, Divest, and Sanction Israel; and Terrorism Against Arabs: Arab American and Civil Liberties post-9/11

The curriculum also pits Jews against other ethnic groups, evokes age-old stereotypes, and explicitly excludes Jews as an ethnic minority, despite an unprecedented rise in antisemitic attacks in the US. The drafted curriculum references a Jewish businessman in relation to success and property rights, an insinuation that Jews are responsible for Arab displacement after the "Nakba."

This curriculum is an embarrassment to fair and balanced high school instruction and should not be allowed to be used in our California educational curriculum.
