From: Bud Genovese Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 1:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I write as a citizen of California to share concerns with the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The ESMC is inaccurate and reflects an anti-Jewish bias. I am strongly opposed to the ESMC moving forward without significant revisions. I am a Catholic, and Democrat and am embarrassed that this current draft has been put forth and should be amended to remove any and all anti-Jewish portions. Thank you, - Bud Genovese, San Jose, CA
