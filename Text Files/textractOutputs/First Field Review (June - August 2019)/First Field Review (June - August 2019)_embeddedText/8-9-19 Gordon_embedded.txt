From: Stephen Gordon Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 12:33 PM To: CFIRD Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: Fwd: TAKE ACTION: Fixing Antisemitic, Anti-Israel CA Curriculum Not Enough - Safeguards Must be Enacted to Prevent Future Educational Hijacking
To Whom It Concerns:
As a concerned parent of California public school students and California tax payer, I
am alarmed by the language contained in AB 331. This bill proposes a model ethnic studies curriculum that would be taught to all California high school students. As written it is antisemitic, omits any information about American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and tropes, glorifies the Boycott Divest Sanction ("BDS") movement and is blatantly antiIsrael. if the current version of this bill is approved all high school students will be required to take at least one course based on this curriculum to graduate.
While fixing the curriculum is critical, we believe that the California Department of Education must first establish safeguards to ensure that the curriculum writers are prohibited from hijacking the curriculum to promote any hateful political agenda. An educational curriculum must not be used as an antisemitic or anti-Israel tool to indoctrinate students and promote hate against any race, religion, individual or group.
I urge that the legislature establish safeguards to ensure that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, may not be created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual - as the current version of AB 331 does. Without such safeguards a model curriculum adopted by the IQC will negatively impact the state's high schools, colleges and universities for years.
Thank you for your consideration.
