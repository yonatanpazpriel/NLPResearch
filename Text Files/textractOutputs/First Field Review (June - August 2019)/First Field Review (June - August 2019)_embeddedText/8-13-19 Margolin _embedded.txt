I think it is important to have students explore ethnicity and learn about similarities and differences in various cultures. While the concept is great, I am concerned over bias and lack of knowledge in what should be included and left out. As a Jew, I am concerned over the rising anti-Semitic acts in this country and around the world. While Jews tend to blend in and are educated, we continue to be a minority and often are also used as scapegoats. This is one area that I do not see addressed clearly. Another area is the Israeli Palestinian conflict which is very complex. I am not sure the conflict is relevant to ethnic studies, but better in a separate class as to understand both sides is a full class. Thank you for listening to feedback. Stacy Margolin
