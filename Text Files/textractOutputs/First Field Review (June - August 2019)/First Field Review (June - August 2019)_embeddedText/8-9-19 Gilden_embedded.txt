From: Julia Gilden Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 8:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comment on ethnicstudies curriculum
I am not part of an organization. I have children who have gone through California public schools. I am opposed to an ethnic studies curriculum that politicizes cultural and social studies. Public school curricula rarely get ethnic studies right, but the least you can do is to stay away from contemporary political labels. That includes Arab and Jewish history in Palestine/Israel now and for the last several thousand years. I don't trust well meaning California curriculum writers to be able to judge unbiased historical representatives in this very contentious part of the world. The subject is complicated and can not be well presented to students in a survey situation. Also, enmity between these people are not a meaningful part of the California experience, unlike so many other ethnic peoples in California. The Arab/Jewish struggle should not be part of a California ethnic studies curriculum
