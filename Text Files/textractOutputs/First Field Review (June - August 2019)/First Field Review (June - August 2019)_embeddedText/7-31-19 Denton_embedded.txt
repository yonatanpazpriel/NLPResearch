Please stop indoctrinating our children into the cult of socialism/communism. Children should be taught to think critically and think for themselves not to parrot communist dogma. Demonizing Capitalism will not solve any problems only create more problems and for more people.
For thousand of years, Capitalism has been proven to lift more people out of poverty than any other economic system ever conceived. The number of people living in extreme
poverty declined globally by 80% from 1970-2006, thanks to free trade & capitalism. According to Foundation for Economic Education, the world is 120X better off today than in 1800, thanks to capitalism.
