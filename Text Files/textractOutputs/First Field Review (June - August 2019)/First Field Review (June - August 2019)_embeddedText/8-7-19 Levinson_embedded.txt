Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
I am a parent of school aged children and I am deeply troubled and concerned by the proposed anti-Israel ethnic-studies curriculum for California. This blatant anti-Israel biased curriculum neglects to include Jews as an ethnic minority, and promotes aggression against Israel, which in turn can create a racist, unsafe learning environment and the marginalization of Israeli-American and Jewish-American students.
