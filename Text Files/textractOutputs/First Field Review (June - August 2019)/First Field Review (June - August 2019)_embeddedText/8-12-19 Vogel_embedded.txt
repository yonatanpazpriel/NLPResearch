Please remove reference to "BDS" and other anti-Israel propaganda. Public schools are not the appropriate forum for injecting political views that are biased to one side. This is a complex issue and the current curriculum proposals take sides with the Palestinians, do not represent the complexity of the region's history, and do not present the Israeli position or the fact that Jews are a historical oppressed minority. They will promote anti-Semitism based on ignorance and disguised as historical fact. p. 2 Please remove reference to "BDS" and other anti-Israel propaganda.
