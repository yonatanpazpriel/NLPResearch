Hello, I read the draft of the proposed ethnic studies curriculum and it does not accurately reflect Jewish and Israel history and promotes an antiSemitic view point of Jews and Israel. This is unacceptable! We are a diverse community in California and no religion or culture should be demonized in our children's ethnic studies.
The curriculum must be revised to include and unbiased and accurate view point of Jews and Israel.
Thank you, Honey
