Comments or Questions:
As a member of Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization of America, I am deeply disturbed by the model curriculum currently being reviewed by the State of California, which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. I am appalled that an educational effort meant to teach students about marginalized communities includes no lessons about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent targets of racism. As a student, parent and now grandparent, I never had an educational experience where any country, including Russia, China, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, etc. were singled out for such unfair treatment as is Israel. 'The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism.' Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism and ignorance of the history of the Jewish people so prevalent in our society today, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing As a grandparent, a California resident, taxpayer and voter, I would hope to see the State of California teaching inclusion and tolerance, rather than BDS, which promotes hate and division. An educational curriculum must not be used as an antiSemitic or anti-Israel tool to indoctrinate students and promote hate against any race, religion, individual or group. SHAME on the people who created this curriculum. Their own bigotry is showing.
