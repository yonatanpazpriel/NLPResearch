From: Mike Ross Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 3:19 PM To: Cc: Ethnic Studies Subject: CFIRD Urged to Adopt Safeguards to Ensure State-Sponsored Curricula May Never Be Hijacked for Political Indoctrination Against Any Group
Dear CRIFD Personnel:
This letter is in regards to the politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which is infused with antisemitic and anti-Israel indoctrination.
Children who fall out of this curriculum's favored group identification will inevitably suffer a sense of isolation, and more than likely receive insults and other intimidation. The curriculum is antithetical to the progressive values of diversity and inclusion, which we cherish.
In regards to the seemingly intractable conflict in the Middle East. This effort to stigmatize Israel and the Jews who support her, will not bring us closer to reconciliation or to a pathway to peace. Inflammatory efforts like this only serve to divide us and to encourage intransigence.
Please ensure that State curricula are never used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, religion, group or individual. Our students are counting on us to educate them wisely and to protect them from mistreatment.
Thank you for your prompt attention to this crucial matter.
Sincerely,
Michael Ross
