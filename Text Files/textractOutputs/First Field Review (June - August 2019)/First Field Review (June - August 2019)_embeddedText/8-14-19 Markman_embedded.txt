From: Joy Markman Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 2:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: antisemitism and anti-Israel is targeted in the biased curriculum being proposed
As an American Jew and resident of California since my birth, I am horrified at what is being proposed. I never would have thought that any government in the United States would proposed such a hostile and biased propaganda driven against Jews and their historical homeland. It is deeply hurtful but worse than that, it is alarming. It is factually wrong. I have been to Israel 5 times in the past 4 decades. I have studied Middle East history in UCLA and at Berkeley as an undergraduate. I scored top A's grades. The closed-minded "curriculum" is totally presenting a false picture and will harm young minds. You are creating a future electorate which will be taught to hate the State of Israel and Jewishamericans. Please DO NOT APPROVE THIS ANTI-SEMETIC PACK OF LIES!!! Sincerely, J. Markman
