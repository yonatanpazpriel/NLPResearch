From: Tolbert Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 11:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies mandate
The proposed ethnic studies mandate represents nothing less than a continuation of the effort to DIS-unite Americans based by focusing on racial-identity and victim-identity group status rather than individual behavior and responsibility.
Do not poison the minds of our future adults with this sort of politically motivated, toxic and dishonest propaganda masquerading as education.
Teach children what Martin Luther King believed: the content of their character is more important than their skin color and ethnicity.
And teach them more mathematics and reading comprehension.
