WE URGE THE BOARD TO SEEK A MORE BALANCED MODEL CURRICULUM THAT ENCOURAGES STUDENTS TO CONSIDER MULTIPLE VIEW-POINTS WITH ALL THE FACTS, AND TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES!
GET DOWN TO BASICS SO OUR CHILDREN CAN READ, WRITE CURSIVE, AND DO MATH AND GIVE THEM THE TOOLS TO GET THROUGH LIFE, THINK FOR THEMSELVES, INSTEAD OF THE B.S. OUR CHILDREN ARE BEING BRAIN WASHED WITH, NOT TO MENTION THE LIMITED SKILLS. GETTING IN COLLEGE AND CAN'T PASS READING TESTS...CANNOT DO ANY MATH WITHOUT THEIR CELL PHONE CALCULATOR.....REALLY! I ASKED THREE TEENAGERS WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF 80% OFF OF $4 WAS AND NONE OF THEM COULD GIVE ME AN ANSWER. THE GAL AT THE REGISTER GAVE ME THE WRONG ANSWER AS WELL AND I TOLD HER THEN YOU ENTERED THE DATA INCORRECTLY. A FRIEND'S SON WAS ACCEPTED AT A STATE COLLEGE. AFTER BEING IN COLLEGE FOR 6 MONTHS WAS GIVEN A READING COMPREHENSIVE TEST AND FAILED!
PUBLIC CURRICULUM UNTIL AUGUST 15 IS DIFFICULT TO FIND EVEN IF IT DOES EXIST, WHICH I DOUBT TO LEAVE COMMENTS!
IT ALL ADDS UP TO A DISSERVICE TO STUDENTS, A DISTORTED VIEW OF HISTORY. AND AN INAPPROPRIATE USE OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS!
