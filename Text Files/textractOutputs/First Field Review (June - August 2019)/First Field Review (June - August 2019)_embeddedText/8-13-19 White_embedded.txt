From: Judy White Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 8:35 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic studies Curriculum
I am writing in opposition to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that has been developed for use in California Schools. It is hard to imagine who has written a curriculum that omits any description of the contributions American Jews have made to this State and Country; omits any reference to anti- Semitism, despite the fact that it is the most prevalent form of religious hatred in the country, manifesting in fatal shootings in Poway and Pittsburgh this year ; YET targets Israel, supporting the BDS movement aimed at harming Israel . I am frankly stupefied that this document ever saw the light of day. WHO WROTE THIS? And why wasn't it fixed before public dissemination and the invitation for public comment? I hope that the Legislsture will reject this Curriculum as currently constituted and send a new group back to the drawing boards to revise it.
