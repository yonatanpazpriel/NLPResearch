From: Davina Drabkin Sent: Friday, August 9, 2019 2:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: comments on ethnic studies curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Committee,
I strongly agree with the sentiments expressed in this letter from the CA Legislative Jewish Caucus. While I support creating and implementing an ethnic studies curriculum, the proposed curriculum guide needs major revision to be fair and equitable. I call on the committee to address the issues outlined in the letter and not release the curriculum until all of these issues are resolved.
Sincerely, Davina Drabkin Trustee, Burlingame School Board
