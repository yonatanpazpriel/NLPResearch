From: Karren Sent: Thursday, August 1, 2019 9:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: ethic studies model curriculum
I was very disturbed to read about the new ethic studies for California schools. It is clearly a one way thinking which is progressive and left in its approach. Its focus is criticism instead of critical. Critical thinking allows students to form their own thoughts after hearing pros and cons of a subject. This new model allows one way to think, there are no pros or cons only criticisms of the way our country has developed. Teaching objective history doesn't seem to be a goal. Why would teachers be asked to have a student plan for direct action such as boycotting, marching, sit-ins. Don't allow this curriculum to become part of our school system, our students and teacher deserve a curriculum without ideological bias. Karren Wright
