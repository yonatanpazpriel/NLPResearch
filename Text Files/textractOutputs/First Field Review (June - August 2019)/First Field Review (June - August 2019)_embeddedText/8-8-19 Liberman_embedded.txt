To: Chairperson Soomin Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission From: Rosette B. Liberman, Ed.D. Re: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and AB331 As a veteran secondary school teacher and winner of The Celebration of Excellence Award (among others), I urge you to radically revise the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to eliminate its scurrilous representation of Jews and to replace its blatant anti-Semitic bias with historical accuracy. How can you justify addressing every possible example of bigotry except anti-Semitism? This omission is at a time when current FBI records reveal 938 anti-Semitic events as opposed to 273 Islamophobic incidents. Yet Islamophobia is addressed at length in this curriculum. Members should not need to be reminded that Jewish Lives Matter. This curriculum denigrates Jews and Israel and entirely overlooks:
� Palestinian terrorism: death tunnels into Israel, thousands of Scud missiles aimed at Jewish hospitals, schools, farms, and villages. In spite of this violence, violence, Israel continues to provide Gaza with its own water and electricity.
� Persistent Arab refusal to negotiate for an independent Palestinian state living in peace with Israel. While Israel has compromised, even offering Arab sovereignty over 98% of the West Bank, the Arabs have rejected their offers and now even refuse to come to the negotiating table.
� The corrupt Arab leadership which enriches itself at the expense of its people. Yassir Arafat died a billionaire. Mahmoud Abbas has built palatial residences for himself and his family. Meanwhlle in Gaza unemployment stands at 52%, and slightly less in the Palestinian Authority only because of Israeli job opportunities. All the US and EU money that UNRWA pours into Gaza and the West Bank is siphoned off into private numbered accounts and into military equipment instead of roads, hospitals, and businesses.
� That Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, with equal voting rights for all its citizens regardless of religion or ethnic origin. Currently 12 Arabs are members of the Knesset (Israel's Parliament). How many Jews are in the government in all the Arab countries? ZERO.
� That Israel sends humanitarian aid workers to other countries. The very first medical team on the ground in Haiti after Hurricane Matthew consisted of Israeli equipment and doctors who delivered the first baby born after the disaster. The parents named him Israel in honor of their rescuers.
� That Israel is America's only reliable ally in the Middle East. These are only a few of the facts that ESMC has ignored, and these facts do not even begin to scratch the surface of American Jewish contributions to the US, and of Israel's humanitarian, scientific, and artistic contributions to the world. ESMC is an egregious example of brainwashing and propaganda. Joseph Goebbels would have been proud of this monstrosity. You still have time to rectify this Holocaust- provoking document and to prevent its becoming the law in California. Sincerely yours, Rosette B. Liberman, EdD
