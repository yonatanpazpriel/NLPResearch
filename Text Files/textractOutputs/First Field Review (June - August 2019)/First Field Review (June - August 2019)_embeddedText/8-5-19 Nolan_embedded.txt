From: Peter Nolan Sent: Sunday, August 4, 2019 12:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Total nonsense
Your proposed ethnic studies curriculum is nothing more than an ideological behavior modification camp. This has noting to do with the fundamental education of our children. This will accelerate the steady decline of California schools. It is nothing more,than leftists indoctrination. It is California's cultural revolution worthy of Mao.
