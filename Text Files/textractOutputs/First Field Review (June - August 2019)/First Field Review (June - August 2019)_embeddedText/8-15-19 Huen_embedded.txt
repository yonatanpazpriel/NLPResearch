Page 171, Row 3529  The railroad was key to facilitating the expansion and cohesion of the U.S. economy, linking the East and West coast industries, cities and communities. This is important for students to understand.
Page 233, Arab American Section  It's important for students to understand that the Middle East encompasses some parts of the Persian world, and that communities from Afghanistan, Turkey, and Iran, for example, may be linked to the Arab world through religions and experience, but not language or culture. Understanding this is important to knowing how people of the Middle East have been lumped together and stereotyped.

Page 241-242  There should be at least a few sentences about the history of Yemeni farmers in California, and how this has created an infrastructure for Yemeni refugees* of war to immigrate to the U.S., including the Bay Area. Having students think about who is counted as a "refugee" could be a good activity, since Yemeni immigrants are not classified as refugees, but they are very much coming from war and not classified due to politics. The Yemeni community in Oakland is quite large, and they own many of the corner stores throughout the entire Bay Area, are very active in business and the mosques across the area, and have mostly gone unseen and overlooked for too long. With increasing numbers of immigrants from Yemen because of the Saudi-led and U.S. supported war, in addition to the travel ban impacting this community unfairly, it's important to include the history and present of Yemeni Americans in our curriculum.

U.S. History and Government classes in high school should include more learning on the Gold Rush & U.S. Immigration Policy through examination of the Chinese Exclusion Act. Why is there not a lesson plan on this? Students often tell me that they learned something about Chinese in the Gold Rush in 4th grade, but they don't get to go deeper into that history at the secondary level, when they can better understand the complexities of our country's immigration system. Oakland Unified School District has worked with the Center for Asian American Media to develop a high school level curriculum on this around the PBS Chinese Exclusion Act documentary, and this can be included or linked in the model curriculum. Lizzie Humphries is the coordinator for that: elizabeth.humphries@ousd.org

There's no mention of our Mien communities in California? The Mien community is significant in Oakland, and is an invisible group with no mention in curriculum. Please include them when talking about Southeast Asian refugees.
