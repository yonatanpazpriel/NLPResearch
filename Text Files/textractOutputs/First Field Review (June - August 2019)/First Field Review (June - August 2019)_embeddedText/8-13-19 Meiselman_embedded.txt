From: sharon meiselman Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 1:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Draft 2020 ethnic studies model curriculum
To whom it may concern,
As a mother and Californian, I feel compelled to register my very deep concerns and alarm regarding this new proposed curriculum.
The curriculum swings into far-left territory that has no place in our schools. "Cisheteropatriarchy", for example, a term that connotes radical backlash against straight males. It's way too far, and I say that as a "cis" white female who considers herself feminist and a strong ally of the LGBT community.
My primary concern however is that it utterly fails to include Jewish people as a religious minority against whom hate crimes are significantly increasing year to year. I myself was a target of repeated verbal abuse by other students because of my Jewish identity in public elementary school (in Pasadena Unified School District K-6), and no teacher or administrator seemed to care. Maybe because I was the only Jewish kid in the school and they figured I was just a one-off.
This draft curriculum fails to address the growing tide of anti-Semitism, aqnd in fact foments it by including quotes with clearly anti Semitic tropes. Its one-sided view of Israel and the BDS movement is frankly alarming, and has no place in a curriculum that claims to have ethnic studies as its main focus.
I ask that you start from scratch on this. Shred this draft.
