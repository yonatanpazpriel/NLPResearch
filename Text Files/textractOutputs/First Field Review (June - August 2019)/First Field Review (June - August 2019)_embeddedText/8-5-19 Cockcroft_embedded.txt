Nick Cockcroft
25 year resident of San Francisco.

I'm just back from Paris, where about half local the population is of African descent. But you'd have to visit to know that � even collecting racial demographic data in France is illegal. The idea is to create a color-blind society where people aren't "black" or "white", but simply French. Judging by the large number of mixed-race couples and children I saw there, the system works pretty well.

Instead of spending tax dollars hypersensitizing children to their "ethnicity", I suggest we follow the French model. Hypersensitization breeds racism and separatism, and wastes valuable classroom hours that could be used to close the "achievement gap" mentioned in the Overview.
