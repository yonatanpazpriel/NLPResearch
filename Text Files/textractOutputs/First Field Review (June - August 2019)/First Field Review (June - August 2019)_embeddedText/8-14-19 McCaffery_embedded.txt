I have heard that the concept of anti-Semitism, and the plight of the Jewish population in the 20th century and in previous centuries, is being absolutely deleted from the current "Ethnic Studies" curriculum, and I am outraged. One of my oldest friends was an 87-year old Holocaust survivor Gedalia Arditti, a Greek immigrant from Salonnika, Greece who lost his entire family during WWII. He came to America, had two children who graduated UCLA, and was a joyful, contributing member to society. America is made up of wonderful Jewish people who have helped build all facets of our culture and economic structure. Future generations MUST understand what happens when hatred takes hold, and what happens when an entire race of people is scapegoated for political and emotional means- both. The COMPLETE Jewsish history, (or at least a VERY accurate overview) including extensive coverage of the Holocaust and the events leading up to it, MUST be included in the upcoming Ethnic Studies curriculum. Thank you for your time...
