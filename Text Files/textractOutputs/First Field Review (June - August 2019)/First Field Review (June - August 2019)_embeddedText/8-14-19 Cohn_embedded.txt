From: Ann Cohn Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 7:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: New Curriculum
I am writing to you protest the adoption by The Department of Education of its proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The proposed curriculum is objectionable as both anti-Jewish and anti-Israel. For example, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel is described as a positive social movement seeking "freedom for Palestinians", when in fact the goal of the founders of BDS is elimination of Israel. Linda Sansour, who is well known for public hatred of Israel, is pictured as a positive role model, and the proposed curriculum legitimizes the false description of Israel as an "apartheid" state. The curriculum also promotes a false equivalence between Palestinian-Arabs and Israel with that of the United States and African-American citizens, and with Israel's effort to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and the U.S. policies on the border of Mexico (page 234). Teachers are also encouraged to use anti-Israel songs, which accuse Israel of stealing land, unjustly imprisoning people and demolishing homes. Furthermore, the curriculum fails to include Jews as an ethnic minority even though the percentage of Jews in the US is far smaller than that of other minorities described in the curriculum.
Such inaccurate and biased anti-Jewish and anti-Israel curriculum has no place in California or anywhere else, where it could be used as a model for teaching impressionable students, which would result in a climate of fear, harassment and intimidation, and incite hatred and harm against Jews.
