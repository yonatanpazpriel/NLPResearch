Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
This curriculum is meant to teach diversity and minority, but there is no mention of the jews or antisemitism. There is also no mention of the great things that Israel does for its Palestinian neighbors, such as health aid and employment BDS is an anti Israel movement which claims apartheid even though there are several arabs living inside Israel borders that live and free life, but there are no Israelis that live within arab/palestenian borders because they would get murdered. A pro terrorist movement, fueled by hate should not be taught in our schools
