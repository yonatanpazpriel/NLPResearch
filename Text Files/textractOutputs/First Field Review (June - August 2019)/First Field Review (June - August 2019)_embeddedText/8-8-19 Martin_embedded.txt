From: Gerry Martin Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 11:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Capitalism as Racist
I have had the good fortune to work in the late Soviet Union for 5 years and in that time interacted with factory workers,technicians, physicians and government bureaucrats. I find it incredulous that capitalism would be singled out as a racist activity by California bureaucrats, when if one really wants to understand the basis for racism, one needs to start with the government. Every communist government which is really an oppresive governent, exploits people of different races, nationalities and identities. Capitalism did not exist in these countries yet people were oppressed and forced into menial jobs akin to slave labor. California government needs to do a better job of coming to grips with reality.
