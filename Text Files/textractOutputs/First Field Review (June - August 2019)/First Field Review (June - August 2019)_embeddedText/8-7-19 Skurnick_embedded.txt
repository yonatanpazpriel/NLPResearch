From: David Skurnick Sent: Wednesday, August 7, 2019 9:14 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Ethnic Studies
Dear Sirs ï¿½
We are strongly opposed to the Ethnic Studies curriculum. We believe it is not proper education. At best, it will be a waste of time and resources., At worst, it may exacerbate ethnic animosity.
Please cancel Ethnic Studies and focus on real learning.
Sincerely yours,
Joan and David Skurnick Menlo Park CA
