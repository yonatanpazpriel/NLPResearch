page 2, lines 30-40 What is BDS doing in the glossary? The glossary is for defining the basic terms needed to understand Ethnic Studies literature. There are dozens of much more significant social movements which could have been mentioned in the glossary. It is noteworthy that no other social movement other than BDS is even mentioned in the glossary. page 10, line 249 I don't think BDS is a legitimate Liberation movement. Under the guise of fighting racism and hate, it purveys racism and hate. There must be other examples: how about listing a couple from the American experience?
page 234, lines 4956-4958 This seems like more of the same harping on the BDS movement, which has little to do with Arab Americans and their travails. By citing the Direct Action Front for Palestine and the BDS movement yet again, you are providing one side of the Israel-Palestine story, not a balanced set of perspectives. By suggesting that "comparative border studies" between US-Mexico and Israel-Palestine makes sense, you are making a bizarre, apples-and-oranges comparison between US anti-immigration efforts and Israel's anti-terrorism efforts.

page 237, line 5030 It's strange to list "Israel-Palestine" on the list of Arab countries. By the two criteria listed (member of Arab League, majority use of Arabic language), it is not an Arab country. They are contradicting their own criteria. Wouldn't Egypt be a more logical choice for this list?
page 242, lines 5157-5163 A formerly victimized indigenous group forms a nation-state with international approval 70 years ago, and we Californians now call it a nakba (catastrophe)? This is strange and biased. The Israel-Palestinian conflict begs for balanced treatment, which must mean including indigenous (Jewish-Israeli) perspectives. Everyone already knows from the news that this is a two-sided conflict. To be taken seriously by students, the state Ethnic Studies Curriculum can't present just one side. pages 256, 264-269 "Somos Sur" is a fine demonstration of international intersectionality, but what is it doing in the Arab Americans section? If I were Arab American, I'd be upset to see my limited space in the curriculum taken up by Chilean/Palestinian poetry. This should be a place for genuine Arab American voices. And then there's the misleading content of "Somos Sur," which misrepresents indigenous JewishIsraelis as colonists (page 268, line 5802). "Somos Sur" is like Busta Rhyme's "Arab Money," in that it illustrates one minority group presenting negatives stereotypes about another, whether consciously or unconsciously. It deserves the same critical treatment.

page 239, line 6238 This is the only mention of anti-Semitism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Federal statistics show that Jews are targeted by more hate crimes in the USA than any other religious group, including Muslims. While this is not a contest for victim status, given California history it's just bizarre that there isn't a chapter on the Jewish American experience. I personally live in a San Diego neighborhood that was redlined against Jews up to 50 years ago. There was a covenant among realtors in my neighborhood that properties could not be sold to Jews. This is directly a part of California history which is not mentioned. Because antiSemitism is mentioned only once in this entire curriculum, combined with the BDS emphasis elsewhere in the Model Curriculum, the overall effect is one of extraordinary unbalance and devotion to a single viewpoint. This is to the detriment of California's reputation and the education of California students. Please revise the Model Curriculum in the interest of fairness and balance.
