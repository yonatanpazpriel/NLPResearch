From: Tom and Pat Reeve Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2019 3:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Pat & Tom Reeve Subject: Please withdraw the politicized draft Ethnic Studies Curriculum.....it is embarrassing to California.
Dear Board Members:
I have just reviewed the Appendices section of the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum currently open for Public Comment.
I would like to share the following with you as my Public Comment:
It has long been California practice to not make partisan propaganda part of any public school curriculum ..... but the authors of the DRAFT ethnic studies curriculum have abrogated their responsibility and offered a political indoctrination course under the false flag of an ethnic studies curriculum. It appears the purpose and scope of this curriculum is not to educate but to lead students to follow certain ideological leanings as advocates for identity politics.
Here is a quote from the Appendices: "One of the main focuses of ethnic studies is translating historical lessons and critical race theory into direct action for social justice."
I ask the Board to throw out this entire embarrassment to California.
Our students need to learn history, not to be politically indoctrinated under the guise of public education. Partisan political advocacy has no place in a public school classroom.
Very sincerely yours,
Tom Reeve
