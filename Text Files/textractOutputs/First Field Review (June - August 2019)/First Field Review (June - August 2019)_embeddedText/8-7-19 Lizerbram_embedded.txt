Please remove BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. Page 2 Line 30 � 40.
Please add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union.

General

As anti-Jewish sentiments rise including San Diego, it is imperative to teach about the holocaust and that Jewish people are a minority and a target of hate.

� In the sample lesson plans...it encourages teachers to highlight BDS and a proBDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives (p. 234).
�
� Promotes a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico (p. 234).
�
� Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country (p. 237).
�
� Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives (p. 242).
�
� Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders (p. 256, 264-269).

The Introduction of the proposed curriculum states that, "The implementation of Ethnic Studies presents an opportunity for teachers to... enable students to develop a deep appreciation for cultural diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With antisemitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing.

Please show the range of people who are Jewish. In the current history books, Jews are reflected only as very orthodox with stereotypical Jewish attire. It does not mention that the majority of Jewish people are assimilated and don't look like that. Many local high schools have had anti-Jewish hate speech and symbols spray painted around. It is important to have this discussion and it be part of the new curriculum.
