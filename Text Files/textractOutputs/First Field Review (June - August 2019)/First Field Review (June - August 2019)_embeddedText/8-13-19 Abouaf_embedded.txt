From: Keith Abouaf Sent: Tuesday, August 13, 2019 12:31 PM To: Superintendent Subject: Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello Superintendent Thurmond,
I am writing this letter to you to ask that you take action to block the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. After reading the LA Times article I went online and looked at the actual curriculum, and was gravely disappointed with its blatantly Far Left political bias. Rather than seeking to turn students into racially obsessed victims seeking to expose microaggressions, an ethnic studies curriculum should seek to help students explore the histories, cultures and values of different groups, and how we can find commonality as humans, and Americans. The proposed curriculum reminds me of some of the ideological classes I took in college - highly one-sided with much less interest in seeking truth than in creating more group-thinking Social Justice Warriors. Thank You, Keith Abouaf
