I am writing to state my full support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum within California K-12 education. California is home to a widely diverse youth population that deserves to be represented and educated about their cultures and that of their peers. As an Ethnic Studies graduate, I strongly urge for the swift implementation and acceptance of this educational curriculum.
