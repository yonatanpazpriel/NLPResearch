Comment This part is not balanced: Judaism is not included as a religion.

Suggested revision: Add a separate curriculum on Jews. Judaism is the religion of the ethno-religious tribal group of the Jewish people with a shared language and homeland (Judea and Samaria which is now Israel). They have endured enslavement repeatedly throughout history, pogroms, the Holocaust.

By law, teachers must "impress upon the minds of the pupils the principles of ... truth [and] avoid ...falsehood." CA Ed Code Section 233.5(a).

"...only instructional materials which...accurately portray the cultural and racial diversity of our society..." are to be used. CA Ed Code Section 60040. CDE's "History and Social Science Framework for California Public Schools" requires that instructional materials "present accurate, detailed content" including primary sources which must convey "an accurate and thorough sense of the period" and narratives which present "an accurate and vivid picture of the times."

Comment
This part is inaccurate: There is not a country called "Israel/Palestine." Israel is not predominantly Arabspeaking and is not a member of the Arab League.
Suggested correction: Israel is a country where the primary language is Hebrew.
