It is shocking to me that a proposed curriculum in the progressive state of California could be so biased.

The ESMC which is supposed to be a fair and neutral overview of ethnic studies is in reality a platform for the BDS movement. How else could it be explained that one of the most prominent forms of prejudice, anti-Semitism,, is not even mentioned or discussed, while Islamophobia is given substantial attention....although there are 3X as many incidents of anti-Semitism in the US than Islamophobia. Jews as an ethnic group are not even mentioned in the ESMC. However, worst of all, is the definition of the BDS movement which is unabashedly slanted, biased and inaccurate. Since when was it decided by the US or the State of California that Israel was imposing "apartheid conditions" on Palestinians! What international law is BDS in compliance with?

Then, in line 4955 of the EMMC, students are provided with a list of recommended topics for further study....all of which have some reference to the Palestinian cause. There is no reference to the greatest hate crime of the modern era, the extermination of 6 million Jews and no information on the background of the establishment of the State of Israel following such tragedy. This is not a veiled attempt at prompting BDS...it is straightforward if anyone cares to read it. It is an attempt to indoctrinate children with pro-BDS ideology and extract any reference to Jewish contributions to the State of California or the origins of the establishment of the State of Israel and the current conflict with Palestinians. The ESMC is itself a statement of hate and the manipulation of our state's educational system to espouse such hate is truly troubling.
