From: Lyn Bond Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 4:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Antisemitism?
Dear committee,
I have read that the ethnic studies curriculum is antisemitic. Is it? Does it include the Jewish community as a group that is often preyed upon? Will students be taught about murders (and attempted acts of violence) carried out by non Jews in Jewish places of worship? Do the lessons encourage boycott, divestment and sanctions for Israel? Does the committee use the excuse that Jewish people are a religion not an ethnic group? Perhaps the people in the committee need to be educated to the fact that a larger percentage of Jewish people identify not as a religious group but as a people with a common heritage, culture and history. How do you define "ethnic "? If people were making a move to boycott, divest and sanction another country would that be seen as opposition of the people and culture of that country just because they are of that people?
Come on people, look at a world map. Israel is a geographically tiny country compared to her surrounding neighbors who wish her wiped from the world.
I hope you will reconsider your stance and conviction which seems to be antisemitic.
Sincerely, L Bond
