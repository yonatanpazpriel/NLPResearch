From: Jane Schaffer Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 9:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: EMDC and the Jews of California
To the EMDC Curriculum Committee:
I write in connection with your plans to include information about BDS that seems prejudicial to the appreciation of the historic contributions of Jews in the state.
I attended Los Angeles public schools and UCLA, as did my mother. Her grandfather, Rabbi Abraham Edelman, arrived in Los Angeles in 1859 and founded congregation B'nai B'rith, the Wilshire Blvd. Temple. He and his children, along with Mexicans, Germans, Italians, Poles, Swedes, and more, worked and intermarried together, building downtown LA from its adobe foundations to the structures of commerce and culture in the early 20th century.*
It was a remarkable melding of groups in pursuit of a common goal. This is the message to bring to students today.
My interest in the Jewish contribution to this history informs my concern that BDS--some of whose aims are laudable--encourages resentment and suspicion against Jews. Antisemitic attitudes are rife around the world. California must avoid adding to such inflammatory rhetoric and should emphasize the most important social cause of this century--working with those who are different from ourselves.
Thank you for your consideration.
Jane Schaffer, LCSW New York City
