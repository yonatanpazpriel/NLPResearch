I just wanted to send you an email letting you know I support the 2020 Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Maybe you don't get enough white guys telling you to do this. That's sad. But, take it from this white guy, you have to do this.
We need to grow up. Help us out.
Also, I live in LA (90027). So, yeah, it'll impact my kids. Help me make them better.
Win, win.
