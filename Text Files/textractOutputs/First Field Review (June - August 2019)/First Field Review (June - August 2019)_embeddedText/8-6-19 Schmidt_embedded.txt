From: Carol Schmidt Sent: Tuesday, August 6, 2019 1:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum Opposition
I've recently learned that the State of California is currently reviewing a model of ethnic studies curriculum which openly promotes hateful boycotts against Israel and omits anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry. I've noticed that the proposed curriculum includes nothing about Jews as a sizeable ethnic minority and frequent target of racism. I urge you to oppose this unbalanced and inaccurate curriculum that will negatively impact my family and future generations!!!!
Sincerely, Carol Schmidt, Ph.D.
