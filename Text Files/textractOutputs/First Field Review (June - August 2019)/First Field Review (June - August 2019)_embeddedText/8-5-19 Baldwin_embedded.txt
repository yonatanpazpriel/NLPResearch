From: A B Sent: Monday, August 5, 2019 9:29 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Public Comment About Proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My comment, below, about the CA State Board of Education's proposed 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum relies on my 25 years as a Adjunct Professor at the University of San Francisco, Organizational Studies Department. After reading the four chapters and appendices of the Model Curriculum I offer this comment:
After reading about and some careful though about the proposed California's Ethnic Studies model curriculum I have concluded that it has no intention of teaching objective history. It is, methinks, training students to become ideological activists and proponents of identity politics. If the curriculum designers have this purpose of encouraging young-impressionableminds to turn away from America's governing/economic principles of capitalism, representative democracy, and federalism, then I shall cast my vote and voice against this attempt of propaganda-education of this kind to our country's young minds.
