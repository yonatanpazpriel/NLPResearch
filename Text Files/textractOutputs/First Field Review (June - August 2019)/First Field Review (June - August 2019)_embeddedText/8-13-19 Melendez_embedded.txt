Manuel R Melendez. CA Resident, born and raised.

Overall, this model curriculum is great if you want to demonize California's nonliberal base. Our State is diverse, however, the CADOE should not advance an agenda that is inaccurate (capitalism and patriarchy as forms of oppression, lines 306-308). The Dept of Ed has the responsibility to teach our children, not brainwash them to become adults that favor socialism and oppression from the government tyranny that the Founding Fathers parted ways with.

California has become nearly intolerable with regards to its political agendas. Leftist policies enacted by a liberal, supermajority legislature want no views except their own expressed.

I adamantly state my dissatisfaction with this proposed model and hope that my voice is heard. Capitalism is what has made this country great and allowed so many to build successful lives for them and their families. It has created a system of individuals that are not dependent on the government for assistance and that drives those in power absolutely insane. This proposal is insane and I pray that I never see the say where this model (or anything like it) is approved and implemented.
