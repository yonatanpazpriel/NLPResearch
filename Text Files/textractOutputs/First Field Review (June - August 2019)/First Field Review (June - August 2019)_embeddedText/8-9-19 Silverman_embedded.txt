To the Ethnic Studies Panel:
I am happy to include curriculum on the different ethnic experiences of people who live in California. But my Jewish children, who are now grown, all went to public school because the cost of a private Jewish school education (which I would have considered in order for them to learn Hebrew and the Jewish traditions), was very high. I also wanted them to be in an environment where they could meet other children from different backgrounds.
But if they, as a family with Israeli cousins and history, were to be singled out as a particular group to be scorned, divested from, boycotted, etc, I would not send them to a public high school in California. As a person who grew up here and went through all of public schools happily and then on to graduate from a UC, I am so disappointed and saddened about the wordings of this supposed curriculum. If you want to talk about the middle east conflict, just tell the history with facts and not add the PC spin so that every student has to come out with the opinion of this panel. Things there are so much more complicated then one lesson to impressionable youth can relate and it is just unfair to try. Rubber stamping the BDS movement (which condemns Israel over all other nations such as Saudi Arabia and its treatment of women) is a mistake and will hurt young people.
