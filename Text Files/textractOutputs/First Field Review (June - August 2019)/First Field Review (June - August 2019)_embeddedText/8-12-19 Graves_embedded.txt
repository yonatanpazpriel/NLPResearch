Thank you for providing the opportunity to submit feedback on your ethnic studies program. I'm a recently retired teacher with LAUSD. I've studied your program and I'm sorry to inform you that I'm thoroughly disgusted. The damage to our children that this program will cause is unspeakable. It's nothing less than pure identity politics whose sole purpose is to teach our students that they are victims. When we teach our students that they are victims, they are taught that they have no control over their own ability to succeed. Trust me, I will do everything within my power to fight against this program. I cannot think of anything more racist and more harmful to the unity of our country and our educational system than this program. Those who support this program are responsible for working toward destroying our educational system and I'm hoping will sooner than later realize the true evil in this program. Your response would be greatly appreciated. William Graves
