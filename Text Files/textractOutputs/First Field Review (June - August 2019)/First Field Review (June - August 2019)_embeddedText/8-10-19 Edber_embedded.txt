Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
"Ethnic Studies is designed to benefit all [my emphasis] students. Christine Sleeter, Critical Education scholar, posits, "rather than being divisive, Ethnic Studies helps students to bridge differences that already exists in experiences and perspectives," highlighting that division is antithetical to Ethnic Studies."
The above statement seems to have been pasted onto this Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum proposal from a another source, presumably an Ethnic Studies Curriculum that actually offers an opportunity to learn something about the richness and diversity of the world's ethnicities.
The introduction states that field of Ethnic Studies emphasizes "people of color", which the glossary defines as someone [sic] who is not white.
The glossary does not define "white", but its definition of "whiteness" includes, Whiteness is the antithesis of Blackness, and is commonly associated with those that identify as white. "White Supremacy" is characterized as an operationalized form of racism that manifests globally.
The strong implication is that color--and the lack of it-- define polar opposites of goodness, hardly an innovative educational concept. This is enlightenment through vilification of the Other, a homework assignment for Racism 101.
I could see how this might improve the self-esteem, and perhaps even the scholastic performance, of some students. The question is, how could this benefit students who are bereft of color?
Until this grotesque bias is resolved, I recommend mothballing this proposed curriculum, pending a major review of the goals and motivations of its creators.
Sincerely, Harvey Edber
