From: Tuck Sent: Thursday, August 8, 2019 10:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Appalled by proposed "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum"
To whom it concerns: I read in the Wall Street Journal July 30, an opinion piece by Williamson Evers, a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution and a former US assistant secretary of education under the Bush administration. The article states that the California Department of Education has issued an "ethnic studies model curriculum" and is soliciting public comment. Assuming that this article is by and large true, I am appalled by its description of capitalism as racist, the focus on biographies of left-wing and radical individuals, the description of critical thinking and the summary in which the curriculum explicitly aims to encourage students to become idealogical activists and proponents of identity politics. I view it as one-sided, blatantly radical and totally unacceptable for an education system in this country! I believe it needs to be discarded and re-written with an accurate presentation of both sides on each topic. Before the re-writing, the writers should spend time in Venezuela or Cuba, where they can experience what they are proposing and where this line of thinking is fed to the people to keep them under government control. Sincerely, T Forsyth San Diego, CA
