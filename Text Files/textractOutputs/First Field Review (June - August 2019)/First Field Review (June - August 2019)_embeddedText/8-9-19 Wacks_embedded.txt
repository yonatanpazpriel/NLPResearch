I do not see the following included in the proposed curriculum: The contribution of Jews to America: Haym Salomon, Albert Einstein, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, George Gershwin, to name a few. Anti-Semitism in America: Peter Stuyvesant, Henry Ford, etc. Refusal of America to take in Jewish refugees before and during World War II. Current anti-Semitism from White Supremacists, on college campuses, etc. I would be happy to appear before the committee preparing the curriculum or even serve on the committee.
