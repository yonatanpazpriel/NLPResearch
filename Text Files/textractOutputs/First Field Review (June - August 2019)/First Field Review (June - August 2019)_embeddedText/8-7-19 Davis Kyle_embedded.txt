I commend the desire to promote diversity and especially in the educational system to help students learn to engage with others who are not like themselves. However, due to the ideological uniformity of this material, the curriculum actually undercuts this goal. This curriculum was created by people of one ideological background who are promoting their particular ideological view through this curriculum. Thus, it is not teaching students critical thinking skills by which they may competently evaluate the varied ideologies that they will encounter in their communities. Please choose a different curriculum that allows students to engage with and humbly evaluate a variety of ideological approaches to these topics. During my time in CA public schools we actually learned to think critically and engage ideas. This curriculum is an attempt to indoctrinate students with a very narrow single ideology and will not help students engage our diverse communities and world.
