> Regarding AB-331, this blatant bigotry and hate, this re-writing of history and twisting of the truth has been tried again and again. This legislation, as it stands, is totally unacceptable and untrue. It will only harm our children, our country, and create a bigger divide than that which already exists. This has been perpetrated over and over again throughout the centuries. Do you really want to perpetrate this evil and be responsible for the murderous outcome? Please reconsider this ideological and false narrative, scrap it, and in truth share the history of the Jewish people in a way that will honor God, all people in this country and around the world, and yourselves as a legislative body endeavoring to do the right thing. > Truth is not relative. > With sincere hope and gratitude, > Marcie Kay Encino, California
