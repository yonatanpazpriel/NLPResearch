Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
In the few instances where the curriculum actually acknowledges Jews, it does so in a denigrating and discriminatory manner.
The curriculum encourages students to study the Boycott, Divest and Sanction movement as one of various worthy "social movements." It defines BDS as "a global social movement that currently aims to establish freedom for Palestinians living under apartheid conditions. Inspired by tactics employed during the South African antiapartheid movement, the Palestinian-led movement calls for the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of the Israeli government until it complies with International law." Nowhere does it acknowledge that this is a controversial movement with many opponents, or that it also would cut off Israeli scholars; it is written as though there is one truth and one truth only for students to learn about this.
