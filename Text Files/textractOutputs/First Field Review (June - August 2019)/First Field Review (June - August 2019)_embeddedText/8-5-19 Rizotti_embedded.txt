Page 2 Glossary Section B Lines 29 through 40 Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS). BDS is a campaign of hate and the purpose is to end Israel's existence. Palestinians are not living in Apartheid conditions. BDS is Anti-Israeli and this does not present anything positive about Israel. It is is one sided and biased in favor of Arabs and Palestinians. Hate does should not be taught in our public schools. Lines 4957 Teachers are to teach that BDS is a good thing without balancing that with the negative aspects of BDS. Line 4958 There is no equivalence between Israel attempting to prevent murderous terrorists from entering the country and the US trying to prevent people from Mexico and Latin America from entering the country who are only seeking economic advantage and who do not have an interest in harming US Citizens. Lines 5024 through 5036 The language is unclear and implies that "IsraelPalestine" is an Arab country. That is a false implication. Additionally, there are Jewish Arabs but it appears the focus of this lesson is anti Israeli and Anti Jewish.

Lines 5154 through 5163 The Palestinian narrative of displacement after the 1948 war needs to be balanced with the Jews being forced from their homes to avoid being murdered by the Nazis. As well as the Displaced persons, who were usually Jewish, having to leave Europe because they had no place to go after their homes were either destroyed or taken over by Christians while the Jews were in the Concentration camps. The Palestinians were not put into damps and murdered. Both sides need to be presented. All of these paged are encouraging teachers to present harsh criticism of Israel without a balance of criticism of Palestinian leaders or positive commentary about Israel. As it stands it is promoting hate and separatism. The feel is anti Israeli and anti Semetic.

PERSONAL COMMENT

Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
Lines 10 through 18.Contrary to the stated goal of Eradication of bigotry, hate and racism this curriculum promotes all of the above by teaching Anti Israeli BDS. Additionally, there is no balance. There are no lessons on the Jewish community and their accomplishments. AntiSemitism is alive and well and anti Jewish sentiment, hate crimes against the Jewish people seem to be on the rise. Jews have been victimized since the beginning of time and this curriculum is only going to make it worse unless it is modified to present positive lessons about the jewish people and Israel. The Jewish people are not included in any part of this curriculum.

Personal Comment: I am currently working in the LA Unified School District as a School Nurse. I am also a Jewish American of Ukrainian/Polish Descent. While I was dong my Genealogic research I had the opportunity to interview older family members who were subjected to anti-Semitic discrimination in cities like Philadelphia and New York. I heard stories of losing jobs when it was discovered that they were Jewish; or not being hired because they had a Jewish sounding name. I grew up in an essentially Jewish community in West Los Angeles and, for the most part, was sheltered from these types of prejudices and experiences. However, I had an upsetting experience in elementary school when a classmate, after finding out I was Jewish, said to me, "You killed Christ." I was so upset because I knew I didn't kill anyone and I didn't even know who Christ was. I remember the boy's name to this day. I did not meet many non Jewish people until I entered High School. Throughout elementary and Middle school, aside from the above-mentioned incident, I didn't experience any anti-Semitism. In High School that changed as my circle of friends now included some Christian girls. Yet, one day one of my friends saw me eating a sandwich made with challah--Jewish egg bread. She started making fun of it including speaking with a fake Jewish accent. All the other girls started laughing. I was so hurt and offended and made me realize that I no longer felt comfortable around kids that were not Jewish. I moved away from that group of girls and found Jewish friends. Unless this curriculum is modified to include the positive contributions of Jews and Israel it will encourage divisiveness. As it stands, this is a potentially dangerous curriculum. Please add lessons on American Jews and their contributions such as Einstein, Salk as well as the positive contributions of Israel. So many inventions come out of Israel. Also, it is vital that students learn about the Holocaust so that never happens again. Soviet Oppression during and after World War II should also be taught. There is no room in the California curriculum for discrimination against any ethnic group.
