From: Sharon Crowther Sent: Monday, August 12, 2019 10:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Curriculum for Ethnic Studies
It's my opinion that California students have not been taught our Country's true history for far too many years. Not sure when this all developed, but I was taught when California was the top in the nation. No longer.
For the California Department of Education to create a curriculum that appears to teach our children resentment of our history vs including all facts to have young minds know all sides. How is it you actually think capitalism is oppressive?
As a parent, grandparent, and a taxpayer, I request you rethink this draft, and start over without any personal bias.
I will remain optimistic that you will listen and do the right thing for the entire population of this state.
Thank you. Sharon L. Crowther
