Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable)
The curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply disappointing. I urge you to remove the discussion of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the curriculum, or include balancing material, as there is considerable controversy about this both within and without the Jewish and general community I also urge you to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. Description of BDS is very one-sided.
Do not include only Arab-American material that focuses on Palestinians without unbiased discussion of Arabs and Jews/Israeli-Americans.
