Kenneth McDonald I am shocked, aghast, angry, furious and mad as hell that any curriculum like this is even being considered for our public schools. You are teaching hate, hate against capitalism, against males, against whites,against America and all the values it stands for, like individualism, you can rise to the top no matter what your circumstances, love of country, respect for each other and respect for all religions. I know this bunch of lies is being taught on college campuses, where parents who earned their money through capitalism send their children to be indoctrinated in everything that America stands for, but that is the parents choice, and stupidity I might add, to pay. But you don't have the right to indoctrinate our children with this hate.When you succeed in tearing down everything that America stands for, you will have Cuba and Argentina. Is that what you want, because this this garbage, that is where you are going. Does that mean that everything in America is perfect now or ever has been? No, but you don't throw the baby our with the bath water. Let me ask you a serious question. How do you think this is going to help California school children? Is it going to bring them together? Is it going t make them happier? Is it going to make them think they can have a great future? Is it going to make schools safer? The answer to all those questions is NO!! What that curriculum will do is sow dissent, bigotry, hate, discontent and a lot of other negative things as unanticipated consequences. Do not implement this curriculum, for the sake of our children and the sake of our country. I am a former teacher in California and am aware of the negative anti-American indoctrination going on now, but this program is over the top. Marie Lynette Fraser
