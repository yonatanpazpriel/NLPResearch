From: Frank Reiner Sent: Wednesday, August 14, 2019 3:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: Slanted Course Material
Your proposed course presents only one side in the Arab-Israeli conflict--the Palestinian side. There is a long history which has resulted in the situation today. Your course material should be complete and impartial. Frank Reiner Central Ave, Hawthorne
