From: Irit Eizips Sent: Thursday, August 15, 2019 2:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Subject: EXCLUDE Anti-Semitism from the ESMC Model Curriculum
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I live in California and care a lot about educating our youth about diversity and inclusion of all types, and have high concerns about recent trends since I have two children in our school system. I am writing to comment on your proposed ESMC proposed curriculum and I oppose it as written today because it fails to discuss antisemitism.
I'm very concerned about the proposed curriculum which reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, and singles out Israel for criticism. As it stands today I believe this curriculum would institutionalize the teaching of antisemitic stereotypes in our public schools. ï¿½ This is NOT right.
I urge you to make major revisions or complete a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, consistent with the recommendations from the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, Stand With Us, Jimena, Amcha and others who are also calling for this change. It needs to include Anti-Semitism and discuss the long time persecution of Jews that continues today.
I'm Jewish, I have friends who are Jewish and in today's climate of hate in this country, Anti-Semitism is at the top of the list for hate crimes and I can't believe that you are not including it in your proposed curriculum and that you are actually including some AntiSemitic Tropes that will be teaching the next generation to wrongly hate Jews (and Israel). This is NOT inclusive and is not right.
I've been in Israel many times since I've immigrated to the US. While Arabs and Muslims can work and walk freely anywhere in Israel, if I, a Jew, as much as try to enter any Arabic village in Israel or a Muslim country for that matter - will be exposing myself to a serious life threatening situation.
As for the US, we made a conscious decision to make sure our daughter doesn't even attempt to apply to Berkeley due to the harsh bias towards the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. This has escalated so much, that I personally deem the institute unsafe for my children.
This is a result of highly biased anti-Israeli and anti-Jewish messages, that are mostly false. While I do not justify limiting citizen's rights from anyone, there will be serious ramifications should the situation be reversed without

any commitments from the Palestinians for peace. This should be reflected in the curriculum with a more balanced approach.
Bottom line, Please do not approve this curriculum as it stands. I want you to make major revisions or a significant rewrite of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
