Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum

Gail Reisman, PhD Sorel Reisman, PhD

As much as we support the concept of ethnic studies, we are very upset at the insensitivity and disregard in this curriculum regarding the presence of a Jewish minority (only 2% of the population) in America...its contributions as well as its history of persecution and its current vulnerability both nationally and internationally. We also question the focus on Israel and are suspicious about the source of the material presented.
