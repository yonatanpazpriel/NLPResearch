This curriculum will do nothing to solve the social ills you claim. Ethnic Studies does little more than to indoctrinate a new class of "victims" which, instead of promoting cohesion between all people by improving understanding of each other, drives further wedges between us. You suggest that "the bar be lowered" in education so that past injustices are repaired. This is the most racist sentiment I have ever heard in that it implies that minorities do not have the capability to achieve on a level playing field. Your racist view that "they can't make it unless we make it easier for them" does them no good and does society no good. Instead, of lifting minorities up, you will bring everyone down and worst of all, set groups of people against each other: Those that feel they have been damaged by the other and therefore "deserve" a leg up, against those that feel they are now being discriminated against for merely not being part of the former group. This in itself is racist and does not promote cohesion among people.

I especially take issue with the curriculum's view that capitalism is a center of power that oppresses some groups. This is hogwash. I cannot believe there are people like those in education that cannot grasp that capitalism and the rule of law are the primary reasons America is the envy of the world. Capitalism has brought more people out of poverty (including people of color) than any other economic system created. To ignore this fact is educational malpractice. To teach our children otherwise is educational malpractice. That is not to say that capitalism does not have its faults which must be studied and addressed, but to go into the discussion that capitalism is a method of establishing power over minorities and is inherently bad is ridiculous. Yet I am sure your so called curriculum espouses the superiority and benefits of socialism and communism, economic systems that have repeatedly failed over the years. I doubt seriously that your introduction to socialism will start with this premise. In closing, I suggest that you reject this proposed curriculum which is nothing more than left wing propaganda which has been present at the college level for many years with nothing to show for it but increased animosity between groups.
