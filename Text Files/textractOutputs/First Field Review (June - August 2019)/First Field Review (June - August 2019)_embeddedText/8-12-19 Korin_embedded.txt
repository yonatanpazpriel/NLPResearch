I am concerned about the current plan for the Ethnic Studies Curriculum regarding its relation to anti-Semitism and the BDS issue. There are numerous instances of anti-semitism in our schools (swastikas, hate speech, etc.). To ignore anti-Semitism as an issue when it is quite prevalent is concerning. In addition, I'm not sure why the curriculum would even highlight the BDS movement, but if it does, the curriculum should be clear about the stated aim of the BDS leadership to eliminate the state of Israel. The Israel/Palestinian issue is so complex, with diverse opinions and concerns. To do it justice would take quite a lot of time, and as a citizen of California, I'd rather students learn about issues facing them more directly as students, such as institutional racism, coping with hate directed at specific groups (including anti-Semitism), immigration issues, and what it means to honor the backgrounds of our population, while also honoring American values such as freedom of speech.
