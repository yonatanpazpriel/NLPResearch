How can you possibly call this an ethnic studies course by leaving out a heavily prejudiced against group such as the Jews? This is an outrage! Throughout history, the Jews have been much maligned and gone through ethnic cleansing many times, including modern times. Are the six million Jewish victims of the Holocaust to be just a blip in history? This is an ongoing injustice for the Jews, the Blacks, the true Americans-the native Americans, the Hispanic people, the Asians, and the muslims, Pan Americans, etc. Isn't there enough racial, hate crimes in this country? California is suppose to be progressive, and this course, as it is now, is unacceptable! Change it appropriately, unless it is your intention to obviously neglect the Jews in this high school course. What are your true intentions? What are you trying to teach the students, that only some prejudice is important? SHAME ON YOU!!! I demand a response to this email. Jan Kalish.
