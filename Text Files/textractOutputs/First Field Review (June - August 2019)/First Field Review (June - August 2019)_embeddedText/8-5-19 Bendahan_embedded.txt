I agree that our Ethnic teaching has been inadequate and needs an upgrade! But to add a biased curriculum in order to teach kids to be unbiased is not the way to create a just, tolerant and empathetic society. Students need to learn to try and understand both sides of a conflict or situation in order to be empathetic to all peoples. Only then can we reign in hate and try to build a just society. Not mentioning anti-Semitism yet mentioning BDS is a one sided view of a complex situation. Doing this leads to more intolerance, bigotry and hate. That is the opposite goal of what a true, good ethnic studies curriculum should be about.
Get a group of unbiased, globally savvy educators to write a good curriculum and chuck this clearly biased attempt. Iris Bendahan
