I am Frank Cowen affiliated with Congregation Shomrei Torah. I am very much opposed to any legislation which excludes Jews and antsemitism. A sample lesson plan should include:
 Encourage teachers to highlight BDS and a pro-BDS group called Direct Action for Palestine, but no voices critical of their perspectives
 Promote a false equivalence between Israel's efforts to stop terrorists from entering communities to murder innocent people, and U.S. policies on the border with Mexico
 Use unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country  Frame the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives  Encourage teachers to use an anti-Israel poem which insinuates Jews control the media and use it
to manipulate the public - a common antisemitic slur Frank Cowen
