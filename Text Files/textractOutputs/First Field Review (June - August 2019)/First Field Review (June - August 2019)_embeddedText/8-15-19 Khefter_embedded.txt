Regarding the BDS movement and other references that seem to show an antiIsrael bias. This really is irrelevant in an American ethnic studies class. The BDS movement is about the Palestinians trying to destroy Israel through world economic pressure. It is hateful and destructive and if the goal of this course is to promote harmony and understanding, there is no place for this. It would also be nice if you can talk about the contribution of Jewish people to America, for example they were at the forefront of African-American human rights, and discuss holocaust survivors who came to America- their challenges and their contributions.
