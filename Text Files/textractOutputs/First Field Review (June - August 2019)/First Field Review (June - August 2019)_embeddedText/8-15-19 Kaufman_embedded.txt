Title: President
Organization: B'nai B'rith International
Comments or Questions:
Considering that B'nai B'rith International is the oldest Jewish organization in the United States, witnessing and having an impact on history since 1843, we welcome the decision by the State Board of Education to review the ethnic studies model curriculum for approval next year. Education must always be grounded in actual history, not propaganda. Ideologies and issues may find their way into the discourse and debate, but they mustn't overwhelm historical fact. Education must pursue and practice the truth over opinion and poisonous, hateful political rhetoric. Any curriculum that, for example, demonizes Israel or denigrates Jews to advance the culture of others is presented without a sliver of honesty or fact. This content cannot be part an educational model about ethnic studies in California or anywhere. The Jewish people have been the targets of anti-Semitism for thousands of years. Enough is enough.
