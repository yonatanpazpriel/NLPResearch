Dear Ethnic Studies:
As a taxpayer parent of California, I ask you to REMOVE the BDS from the model Ethnic Studies curriculum which your are reviewing. BDS is an anti-semitic organization. BDS exists to promote hatred toward Israel and Jews.
Instead, please add lessons about Jews as a marginal ethnic group with a long history of continuing oppression, bias and discrimination in all countries. There are many tragic examples that should be taught. For example, the day of Tisha B'Av which just passed is a day of recall of many of these.
I hope and trust that you will consider and change your Ethnic Studies curriculum before a sad error is committed.
Thank you for your work on a correct curriculum.
Doris Jean Long
