Course Overview: This course is designed to help students develop an intersectional and global understanding of the impact of race and racism, ethnicity, and culture in the shaping of individuals and communities in the United States. They will learn about the interlocking systems of oppression and privilege that impact all people of color. Students will be exposed to a multitude of histories, perspectives, and cultures, with the goal of students being able to build critical analytical and intercultural communication skills; developing an understanding of geo-historical and cultural knowledge and contributions; fostering of humanism and collaboration across lines of difference; learning the value and strength in diversity; and developing a rigorous historical understanding of the development of racial and ethnic identities in the United States; and engaging in civic action, community service and/or community education to dismantle white supremacy and institutional racism.
Course Content: Given the interdisciplinary nature of Ethnic studies, students will be exposed to many subject areas, including, but not limited to, history, geography, literature, sociology, and visual arts. In engaging a thematic approach to teaching courses in the field, teachers can organize their instruction around various themes, such as: identity formation (assigned and chosen), migration, cultural retentions, the history of racial formation and racial hierarchies, ideologies and institutions, social movements and resistance to oppressive systems of power (i.e., racism, classism, sexism), hegemony, and colonialism. These units should focus on drawing out student voices and their experiences. They should also emphasize the integral role of both white and oppressed groups in creating alliances, resistance, and resilience (including the positive contributions of the oppressed groups).
The use of a thematic approach to teaching Ethnic studies is incredibly generative as students are able to consider an array of inquiry-based questions—from more overarching questions around racial formation and their own ancestral legacies, to more focused inquiries that may address issues in their communities, like a public health inequity that is being exacerbated because of the racial and/or class make-up.

1.	What are the similarities and differences between the immigration patterns among Arabs throughout US history?
2.	What are the similarities and differences in the experiences of Arab groups after immigrating to America?
3.	How are the experiences of Arab immigrants connected to those of other communities?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Time Required: 100-150 minutes
•	Teacher distributes the “History of Arab Immigration to the United States” handout to students the day before the lesson. Depending on time, teacher can either have students read the handout for homework or as a warm up. Students are assigned to mark three points that surprised them and write out three questions they have after reading the handout.
•	Teacher distributes a blank map of North Africa and the Middle East. Students write in the names of any countries they recognize and mark each Arab country with a star. When student have finished, the teacher projects the same map and fills it in along with the students. To wrap up the exercise, students identify the ways that one might identify a country as “Arab,” (e.g. predominantly Arabicspeaking, member of the Arab League). If time permits, students highlight Lebanon, Syria, Israel-Palestine, and Iraq, and for each country teacher explains what time periods saw significant immigration from each of those countries to the US. (10 min)
•	Teacher has students take out the handout that they read for homework along with their questions. Teacher asks students to share what points surprised them. Teacher collects their questions and uses them to inform the next day of teaching. (5-10 min)

provoked a backlash in the US from some among the white majority of European origin, who believed that these immigrants would negatively influence the character of American society. This nativist trend resulted in restrictive immigration policy and legal and institutionalized discrimination against groups that did not fit the white, Western European, Protestant profile. This first wave of Arab immigration ended with the passage of the Immigration Act of 1924 (the Johnson-Reed Act), which sharply restricted the number of immigrants through a quota system. Only one hundred Arabs were allowed to immigrate each year.
The second wave of immigrants, in the middle of the twentieth century, arrived more slowly because of these restrictions in immigration law. This wave was smaller (less than 100,000) and much less homogeneous than the first. Immigrants both Christian and Muslim arrived from all over the Arab world, not just Syria. The largest single group was Palestinian, as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians had been displaced in the Nakba (Arabic for "Catastrophe," the term used to describe the dispossession and dispersal of many Palestinian Arabs from the new state of Israel in the 1948 Palestine War). Most of the Arab immigrants to the US in this period, Palestinian and otherwise, were well-educated professionals because restrictive immigration laws kept out those without wealth or a trade.
Second wave immigrants left the Arab world at a time when Arab nationalism was rising as a powerful ideological force. Many of these new immigrants identified as Arabs and considered their Arab identity politically central. The term “Arab1' is generally used to mean someone who speaks Arabic, but as with other ethnic terms, an Arab is anyone who identifies with Arab culture and history and the Arabic language.
The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 loosened the restrictions that had kept out many immigrants, ushering in a massive third wave of Arab immigration. Many Arabs in the third wave, which continues today, were fleeing violence at home. The Lebanese Civil War from 1975 to 1990 prompted thousands of Lebanese to seek security in the West. Iraqi refugees fled the Gulf War, the abuses of the regime of Saddam Hussein,

•	Students read the article, Busta Apologizes for Releasing Arab Money where Busta apologizes for being racist. Afterwards, students reflect on whether or not artists should be held solely responsible for reinforcing stereotypes. If not, who and/or what should be? (10-15 min)
•	Day 2: Teacher distributes song lyrics to the song, "Somos Sur” by Ana Tijoux and Shadia Mansour. Teacher introduces the song by explaining that:
“Somos Sur" is a song off Ana Tijoux’s latest album "Vengo". She collaborated on this song with Shadia Mansour, who is an Arab hip-hop artist from Palestine. Ana is from Chile, where her parents were exiled under the dictatorship of Pinochet a few years before she was born in France.
•	Students listen to the song and are instructed to do the following:
o While the video plays, try and follow along with the lyrics
o Underline 3 lines that stand out to you-either in English, Spanish, or Arabic
o Ana Tijoux is quoted as saying, “I feel that music is an amazing weapon, an amazing tool, like to have this reflection with the world. It’s a conversation, a dialogue with the world.”
o Using this song and your own personal experience with music, explain how music can be used as a weapon and how it can be used to give people agency?
•	Students share their responses to the lyrics. Teacher specifically focuses on their responses to the quote by Ana Tijoux.
•	Teacher distributes the assignment titled, Soundtrack of Hegemony. Students will explore their own experiences with hegemony. They will use the information they have used in the unit to create a cover for a CD that includes songs about

From bomb makers stripping Islam Naked
The strong face of the wrong fakers, in calm nature, see
The truth in America's hip-hop is gone sacred
Not to generalize, dawg, this song's racist
[Outro]
So don't get it twisted
See not all Arabs are rich, my brothers and sisters
Get your history right
"Arab money' came from British colonialism
So that means the slave master got you back
So when you look at that money in your pocket
Make sure you spend it right
Letra de “Somos Sur" ft. Shadia Mansour
Tii nos dices que debemos sentarnos
Pero las ideas solo pueden levantarnos
Caminar, recorrer, no rendirse ni retroceder
Ver, aprender como esponja absorbe
Nadie sobra, todos faltan, todos suman
Todos para todos, todo para nosotros
Sonamos en grande que se caiga el imperio
