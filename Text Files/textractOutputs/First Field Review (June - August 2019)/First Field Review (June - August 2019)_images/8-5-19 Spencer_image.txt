Dear Mr. Thurmond:
State Superintendent of Public Instruction
AUG 5 2019
I understand a public comment period exists until August 15 on the draft “Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum”. My comments follow.
This is the most outrageous proposal in the history of education in California and can only cause further racial divisions in our schools and ultimately in society as students mature into adulthood. It is also a document against capitalism which is the very basis of America’s economic success throughout our nation's history.
While this study proposes to teach students “ethnic studies”, instead it teaches them to hate: hate America, hate capitalism and ultimately to hate each other because of our racial differences and our country’s past history of human rights injustices. It also encourages them to disrupt society with sit-ins, boycotts, marches, strikes and other forms of civil disobedience as “agents of change”. Why not simply have our instructors teach Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals or Karl Marx’s Das Kapital if the goal is to brainwash our youth to the same dangerous ends?
California formerly had the most envied education system in America. Now we are ranked near the very bottom. Our citizens are dismissed by others in the nation as weird nut-cases in particular for proposals such as this to be used in our schools.
I urge you to end any further consideration of “Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum”.
Respectfully,
