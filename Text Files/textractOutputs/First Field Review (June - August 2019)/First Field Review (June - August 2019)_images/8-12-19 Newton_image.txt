Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable):
Page 2: Requesting removal of BDS and other anti-Israel bias from the model curriculum. I urge the State to add lessons about American Jews as an ethnic group, including those who fled the Holocaust, oppression in the Middle East, and discrimination in the former Soviet Union. As a proud native Californian and mother of two children who are educators, I am appalled that the State is even considering such a biased curriculum. Examples of bias in the proposed curriculum: the introduction of the proposed curriculum states that "the implementation of the Ethnic Studies Presents an Opportunity for Teachers to Enable Students to Develop a Deep Appreciation for Cultural Diversity and inclusion, and aids in the eradication of bigotry, hate, and racism." Despite this stated goal, the curriculum does not feature a single lesson about the Jewish community, mentioning Jews only in passing. With anti-Semitism rising and ignorance about the Jewish people still a major problem in our society, the exclusion of Jews from this curriculum is deeply appalling. The Holocaust is being forgotten. Indeed, it is being denied in some instances.

Body of Document		
p. 234: Uses unclear language that implies "Israel-Palestine" as a whole is an Arab country.
p. 242; Frames the Palestinian narrative of the 1948 War as fact, with no alternative perspectives.
p. 256, 264-269: Encourages teachers to use a poem featuring harsh criticism of Israel, but no content offering a positive perspective about Israel or criticism of Palestinian leaders.
It is with my deepest respect for the State of California and the Department of Education that I ask for these changes to the curriculum.
