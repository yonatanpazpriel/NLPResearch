Glossary	Samuel Hiatt	Glossary Page 2 lines 29 -40. Please remove the inclusion of BDS. This movement encourages hate and demonization of Israel. BDS presents a distorted picture of Arab-Palestinian life in Israel. Please remove other anti Israel references on pages 234, 237, 242, 256, 264-269. The Arab-Palestinian people have suffered unjustified discrimination here in the United States and around the world. BDS wants to destroy and cripple Israel as it exists today.
General		I encourage the state to add lessons about the hatred towards American Jews. Many of these people fled persecution from pogroms, the Holocaust, discrimination in the Soviet Union and oppression in Middle Eastern countries.
