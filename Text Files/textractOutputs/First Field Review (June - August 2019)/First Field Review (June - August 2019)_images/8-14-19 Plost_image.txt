Comment (include page and line numbers where applicable):
I’m dismayed that Jewish discrimination for so many years in our history was not included. Like other minorities, Jews were limited in colleges they could attend, housing they could buy, jobs they could get and fair promotions. Jews could not seek refuge in the U.S. in the late 30’s and 40’s from Nazi murderers (not unlike some current immigration from countries today that pose threats to their citizens.) Also not included was the foundation of Israel where so many desperate Jews settles after the Nazi murder of 6 million Jews, men, women and children. Hopefully a separate nation can be established for the Palestinians and currently their government runs their own state. The Jewish state has excelled economically. Consider the economic, political and financial chaos in the Middle East. Israel has remained a major Mideast supporter of the U.S.
