I read recently about an new ethnic program standard that seems to me maligns our way of life in America including fairness to all including 'non-ethnic' people which in my opinion don't exist and capitalism which is why many people try to break into the USA and break out of their own failing noncapitalist countries.
Pleas scrap this curriculum and take the position that we can only go forward with love, using all our current skills.
I am horrified that our state is dragging students backwards and making them, in my opinion hateful and resentful toward their fellow students, none of which chose their race, ethnicity, basket of skills or school district.
Brake loose from all this resentment about past unfairness and try to get the best for Everybody. Scrap this standard now! It is ugly and unworthy of a great state.
