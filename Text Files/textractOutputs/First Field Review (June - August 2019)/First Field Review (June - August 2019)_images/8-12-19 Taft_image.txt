Your blatant disregard for numerous antisemetic phrasing and overall crappy attitude is appalling. This kind of rhetoric sickens me. When I grew up and went to school here in the 1970’s, this kind of biased crap was unacceptable. You are advocating nothing more than racist biased views. Disgusting. I plan to keep my contributions to the California education system to the bare bones. Not the California I grew up in!!
