RE: Concerns Presented in the Current Draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in Relation to the Inaccurate and Misleading Representation of the American Jewish Experience
Dear Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Committee,
The City Council of Agoura Hills stands with our State Senator Henry Stern, State Assemblymember Richard Bloom, the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, and our local Las Virgenes Unified School District Board in urging you to review and revise the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
We applaud the goals of the ESMC in its intent to educate students on the realities of prejudice and oppression. However, as the California Legislative Jewish Caucus has detailed, there are blatant omissions, misrepresentations, and an anti-Jewish bias in the ESMC as it stands today. We are aware you have received similar concerns from our school district board members as well.
Agoura Hills has a significant, diverse, and thriving Jewish population. As such, we have seen our unfortunate share of anti-Semitic incidents. As hate crimes continue across the country with increasing violence and frequency, we cannot minimize the experiences of our Jewish communities and the discrimination they face, past and present, locally, and beyond.
Respectfully submitted,
Linda Northrup, Mayor
