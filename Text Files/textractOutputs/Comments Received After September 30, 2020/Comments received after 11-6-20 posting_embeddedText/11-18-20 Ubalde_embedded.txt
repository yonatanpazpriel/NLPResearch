I called in as soon as the line opened for public comments and got through right away. Somehow I was never called and perhaps due to the early technical problem experienced in the beginning of the public comments period.
I am submitting my comments listed below for your consideration. Thanks.

Good afternoon, my name is Cynthia Chang, president of API School Board members Association.
I am here to support the API School Board Members Association's position to restore the Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC. In addition, adding four more lesson plans for Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese and Indian Americans.

I would also like more clarity and to increase the prominence of Comparative Race and Ethnicity Studies Approach in Chapter 3 - to be a home for lessons that are in converstion, but do not dilute, the AAPI, Black, Latinx and Native Studies of ESMC.
I am a first-generation immigrant with two sons who have gone through the K-12 public education system. I noticed the lack of ethnic studies in the curriculum and that World History curriculum was Euro-centric. It is my sincere hope that ESMC provides our students with an appreciateion of cultural diversity and inclusion which will aid in the eradication of bigotry, hate and racism.
