From: Speed, Shannon Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 7:50 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Imperative additional line item edit
Dear CDE,
Regarding the recommendations in our Indigenous Education Now (IEN) letter of 9/30/20, the CDE missed an imperative recommended line edit. Please include and recommend it in your updated summary of line item edits to the IQC.
Chapter 2, lines 514-628 are dedicated to District Implementation Guidance, and Key Considerations for District and Site Administrators.
We recommend adding the following specific bullet point be added in Chapter 2, line 601:
"Tribal Consultation: Districts are required to conduct Tribal consultation with California Native American Tribes and Tribal organizations in the development of and prior to the implementation of their local Ethnic Studies programs, and should include consultation with Native American and Indigenous organizations in their district as well as Native American scholars and educators."
Note, this is distinct from the land acknowledgment present on lines 542-543.
Thank you,
Shannon Speed on behalf of the Indigenous Education Now Coalition

Incarcerated Stories: Indigenous Women Migrants in the Settler Capitalist State

The AISC at UCLA acknowledges the Gabrielino/Tongva peoples as the traditional land caretakers of Tovaangar (Los Angeles basin, So. Channel Islands). As a land grant institution, we pay our respects to the honuukvetam (ancestors), 'ahiihirom (elders), and 'eyoohiinkem (our relatives/relations) past, present, and emerging.
