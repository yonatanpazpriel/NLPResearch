Dear Instructional Quality Commission,
Please return Arab-American studies to its rightful place in Asian Studies in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Our state needs a robust and complete ethnic studies program. No one should be relegated to appendices, especially not at the behest of certain organizations.
My children are now grown,but if there had been an ethnic studies program in their schools when they were young, they likely would have had a far more positive school experience. My husband and I are both retired educators. We urge you to make sure that our ethnic studies program is the best possible. Our state is an example to the rest of the nation. Let's do this right. Sincerely, Charisse Cordero Carpinteria, California
