Hello,
I am in support of Arab American studies and Pacific Islander studies being fully integrated into the ethnic studies curriculum. The placement of Arab American studies into the appendix of the curriculum is honestly anti-Arab in this climate. The disregard for a community that has been targets of discrimination and surveillance deserve recognition and opportunities of education. The bare minimum is to fully include Arab Americans, but even that is attacked at the lowest level. Please reconsider your decisions and please make decisions that do not take away your "progressive" title.
