From: Salem Ajluni Sent: Wednesday, November 11, 2020 5:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] A Letter to the California Department of Education RE: Ethnic Studies: Arab American Lesson Plan
To Whom It May Concern: I am writing in support of the Save Arab American Studies Coalition and to request that you:
1. Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Depart of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee;
2. Re-insert Arab American studies to its rightful place within Asian American studies;
3. Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory;
4. Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism contained in the curriculum or sample lesson plans that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Simply put, antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
Sincerely,
Salem Ajluni San Jose, CA 95128
