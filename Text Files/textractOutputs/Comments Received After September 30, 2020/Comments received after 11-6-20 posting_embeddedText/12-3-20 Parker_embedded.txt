While it is true that the SFSU student government passed by almost unanimous vote a BDS resolution it is also true that President Lyn Mahoney squashed this resolution saying that it grossly oversimplified a very complex situation. The inclusion of the JIMENA (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa) lessons into the K-12 ethnic studies curriculum was an important victory for the teaching of the facts about Israelis, but it doesn't affect the teaching of Ethnic Studies on the college level. Still Lyn Mahoney has gotten the message that the kind of one-sided simplistic picture of Israel that has dominated our education system for so long really must come to an end. I applaud her for beginning this essential conversation.
