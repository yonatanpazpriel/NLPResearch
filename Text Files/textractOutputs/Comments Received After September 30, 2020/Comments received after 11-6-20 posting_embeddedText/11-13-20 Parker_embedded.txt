"What the educator does in teaching is make it possible for the students to become themselves" Paulo Freine We Make the Road by Walking
Please give all students the chance to see themselves and to "become themselves" in the ethnic studies curriculum, and to aim for full inclusion. The curriculum should represent diverse Middle Eastern communities in California, such as Jews, Iranians, Arabs, Kurds, Assyrian Christians, Coptic Christians, and others, in addition to Arab Americans. There are multiple groups that have been historically victimized and oppressed, and there is no educational or moral justification for favoring one of these communities over all others, under the ESMC's broadly defined umbrella of Asian American Studies. The ESMC should be revised to add an inclusive unit about Middle Eastern Americans, which includes the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA . This should go through the same vetting process and public comment period as the rest of the curriculum. Existing references to American Jews should be edited to explicitly mention the experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Jews of color, Jews from the Former Soviet Union, and other Jewish communities in California whose stories are less widely acknowledged. Furthermore, a section should be added to the ESMC covering various forms of hate, including antisemitism in all its forms across the political spectrum.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
