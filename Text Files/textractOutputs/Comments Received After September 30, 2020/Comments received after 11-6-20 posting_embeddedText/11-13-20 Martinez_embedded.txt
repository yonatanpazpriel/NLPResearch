Hi,
Hope this finds you well. I would like to submit a public comment in regards to the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. You can find my comment below:
"I am in support of an Ethnic Studies curriculum that shines a light on the triumphs and struggles of those communities that for far too long have been excluded and erased. This includes the ArabAmerican and Muslim community. It is no secret that there are powerful institutions and people in this country whose entire mission is to undermine Arab-Americans and Muslims and to push for a political agenda that promotes Islamophobia. The role of public education is not to perpetuate these harmful views -- the role of public education is to create a space for meaningful dialogue, one in which Arab and Muslim youth are truly welcome and authentically represented. Without this critical component, we are damaging the mission of California's Ethnic Studies model curriculum."
