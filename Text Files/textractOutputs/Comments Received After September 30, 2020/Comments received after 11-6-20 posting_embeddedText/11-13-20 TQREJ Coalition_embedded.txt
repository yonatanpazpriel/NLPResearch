Dear CDE,
Please update your public comments and specific line item recommendations (#'s 1, 2, and 3 below) in your summary of requested line item edits, and it would be greatly appreciated if you would recommend these line edits to the IQC. Also, please include our attached lesson plan in lesson plan options for the IQC to include in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum as well, it adds a necessary dimension.
Thank You,
