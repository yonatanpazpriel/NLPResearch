As a California residence/citizen, Please see my demand below, thx:
� Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies. � Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and
liberatory. � Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.
