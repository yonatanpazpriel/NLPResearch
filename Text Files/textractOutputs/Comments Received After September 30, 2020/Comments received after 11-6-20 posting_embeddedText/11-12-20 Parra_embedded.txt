Hello,
I am here to express the urgency of adding Arab Studies to out ethnic studies curriculum.
I am here speaking as a social justice educator and as a resident of the state of California.
I grew up in the Central Valley near Fresno, CA and growing up I witnessed and participated in out right Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. Arab and Muslim youth within my community were invisilbilized and targeted constantly. There is a small Yemen community in my majority Latinx community and I still see how they are ostracized within our community.
It is time that Arab American narratives are centered. Arab youth have learned little about their history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education.
It is imperative that you add Arab Studies into the ethnic studies curriculum because without it we are only further emphasizing the divisions of our American society which especially within the past 5 years has become notoriously Islamophobic and anti-Arabic.
Thank you for your time.
Best, Ms. Parra
