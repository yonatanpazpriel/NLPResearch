Agenda Number 8.A.1

I support the original model curriculum from September 2020. The original guiding principles of Ethnic Studies are to focus on the African American, Asian American (which includes Arab Americans), Chicano Studies, and Native American studies. The vocabulary of racism, antiblackness, model minority myth, and other words are essential for children to understand the origins of different ethnic cultures. Please focus on the expertise of the creators of the original draft rather than the anti-black and brown battle this has become. The history of these ethnic groups is not political. The recent edits to the curriculum is blatant erasure of these experiences.
