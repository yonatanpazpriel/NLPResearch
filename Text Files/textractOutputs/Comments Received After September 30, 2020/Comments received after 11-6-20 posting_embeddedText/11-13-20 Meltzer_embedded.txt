I am writing as a California parent deeply concerned about the model ethnic studies
curriculum. Firstly, thank you all for your hard work and your commitment to California's children. This draft is finally on its way to fulfilling the core call of inclusion and education of AB 2016. However, I am concerned that fringe groups are trying to reverse much of the progress we have made.
I urge you to support the full inclusion of Sikh-Americans, Armenian-Americans, Jewish Americans and other minority communities in the ethnic studies curriculum. The children of all minority and ethnic groups deserve to be recognized and validated, and to see themselves as part of the diverse whole of California. We are stronger when all voices are heard. The unique stories of these groups should not be overlooked or relegated to a footnote. I also urge you to support the inclusion of the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and to continue your dialog with mainstream Jewish communal institutions. Mainstream Jewish organizations should be in charge of defining antisemitism. The IHRA definition has been increasingly adopted by the international Jewish community, by universities and by municipalities. With anti-Semitism and violence against the Jewish people increasing at an alarming rate in California and across the country, it is clear that education can be a vital first step in building a better California.
Thank you, Faith Meltzer
