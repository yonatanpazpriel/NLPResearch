Antisemitic Social Media Posts Mary O'Leary � 16 days ago � Tuesday, Nov 17 at 2:34 PM � Tamalpais Union High School District Dear TUHSD Community,
Regretfully, I am reaching out today with news that new antisemitic social media accounts and postings on TikTok and Instagram appeared for a short time yesterday. These accounts again targeted our Jewish students and families with hateful messages including references to false claims the holocaust never happened, rape and homophobia. The accounts also followed Jewish students and asked Jewish students to follow the accounts. To say that I am saddened is an understatement. I am angry and disgusted that our community is again facing antisemitism on social media. These sites were immediately reported to TikTok, Instagram and the Central Marin Police Authority. The Instagram account has already been taken down and the TikTok videos were removed.
While we believe that it is likely this is the activity of one or only a few people, we again remind our community that we stand in support of our Jewish students in the face of this antisemitic hate and bigotry. Hatred and bigotry from even one person is an attack on all of us and contrary to the respect for everyone we work to instill in the RHS community.
I want to again thank our students and parents who stood up and reached out to us. We were quickly notified by students and parents who reported the accounts, posts and videos. Even though the Instagram account has already been taken down and the TikTok videos have already been removed, these accounts may continue to pop up as we have seen an increase in antisemitic and other hate incidents across the country as indicated in this article.
These hate based accounts spread their venom through viewers, followers and sharing. One of the best ways we can combat these sites is to avoid participating and interacting with them and giving them more "air time."
We recommend the following if you become aware of, are invited to or are followed by one of these hate accounts:
� Do not visit the sites. � Do not respond to or follow the accounts. � Do not watch the videos. � Do not like the posts, videos, etc. � Do not share these accounts, posts or videos with others. � Make your own personal accounts private. � Report the accounts, posts, videos as hate speech using the social media's Report function.

� Continue to let us know if this is connected to school in any way (please include screenshots, if possible).
I also wanted to let you know that the police investigation into earlier antisemitic social media postings is active and ongoing and we are working closely with the police in this investigation. We will share more information as we receive it from the police.
In whatever manner you deem appropriate, please take some time to discuss this event with your family. We know that the majority of our students stand against these types of actions. We commend them for that and we call on all in our community to stand in solidarity against acts of hatred, discrimination and antisemitism. The next step � and it is a difficult one � is to be willing to step in and intervene when we see harm being done. Our schools continue to engage in dialogue about issues of equity, antisemitism, discrimination and privilege and would appreciate anything you can do to reinforce and supplement this at home. We can't do it without each other.
For our part, to combat antisemitism,
� Rodef Shalom Rabbi Stacy Friedman met with our Leadership class students. � We promoted community participation in the Jewish Family and Community
Services/ADL/Marin County Office of Education workshop series, Confronting Online Antisemitism, which includes workshops for teachers, students, parents, administrators and a countywide facilitated conversation. � We will be implementing Anti-Defamation League (ADL)-developed lessons into our classes in March. � Our Social Studies Task Force has developed a matrix to ensure the concepts of antisemitism and bias are taught across all four years of high school. � We are encouraging ongoing conversations in the classrooms around antisemitism and hate and the historical significance of the language and references made in online posts.
