I am writing to you as a Jew who is horrified by the definition of anti-semitism that your new curriculum is promulgating. Your definitions of antisemitism (The IHRA and ADL definitions) that label criticism of Israel as antisemetic have been proposed for inclusion in both the preface and in a sample lesson plan on MIddle Eastern Jews.
As you should know criticism of injustice is a brave and important responsibility of people with conscience. When a country is violating human rights criticism of wrongdoing is essential. I am Jewish and want to make sure that real antisemitism, which is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish is unacceptable and should be effectively confronted. However, it does not mean that any criticism of Israel's cruel and unjust policies against Palestinians (which violate international law), is antisemitism, it is instead free and honorable speech. I hope you will respond to my concerns about your new curriculum's content. Thank you for attention to my concerns, Barbara Engel -Barbara Engel [email redacted]
