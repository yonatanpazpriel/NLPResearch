Dear Super Thurmond, I want to thank you for continuing to develop this curriculum. I was disheartened when this curriculum was not approved by the governor. I am glad your team is taking the time to get it right. I am a parent in PYLUSD and my district has elected 2 trustees who outspoken about their opposition to this curriculum while proving again and again that they have no idea what is contained within it. Please continue to move toward the implementation of this curriculum. Thank you, Brooke Harper Mom of 2 PYLUSD
