IQC,
Ethnic Studies' focus on the 4 groups is to recognize the oppression these groups received as a result of appearing racially different than whites within U.S. History. This is not to dismiss or demean the discrimination and antisemitism that Jewish and ArmenianAmericans have experienced in any form. The fact of the matter is that the melting pot does not apply to people of color, people who do not look or cannot pass as white, and American Jews and Armenian Americans have been able to enjoy the melting pot experienceafter generations of being in this county. Ethnic Studies specifically addresses the issue of racialization as a social construct, the problems with white supremacy as a hegemonic system that embeds ideas that anything white is better, is superior into ourchildren. All this to say, we need to respect that Ethnic Studies is a safe space to talk about white racism, white supremacy, and white priveledge.
It is important to protect these boundaries and respect the integrity of Ethnic Studies. I do not support having lessons about Armenian Americans and Jewish Americans within the curriculum of Ethnic Studies. But I feel it is important to promote the teachingof the Armenian American Experience and Jewish American experience within other curriculums. Below is a link to an article by J weekly that understands Ethnic Studies.

WhyJews should support the state's high school ethnic studies curriculum ï¿½ J.
Last week in J., our colleague Rabbi Serena Eisenberg wrote a harsh critique of California's proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum headlined "Why are school boards OK'ing California's flawed ethnic studies model?". We are strong supporters of the ESMC draft,and we believe it's critical for Jews and Jewish communities to support it.
