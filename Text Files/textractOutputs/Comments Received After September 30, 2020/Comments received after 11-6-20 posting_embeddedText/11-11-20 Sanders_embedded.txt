I understand that, under pressure from Israel lobbying and advocacy groups, the California CDE is poised to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes criticism of Israel as a component of such bigotry.
Over the years, these same groups sought to pressure the UC Regents, the California State Legislature, and the US Congress to do the same thing. But all these entities responded to community outcry, and refused to adopt this pernicious definition. To be sure, President Trump defied such precedents and issued an executive order based on the definition. Those are the footsteps in which you will follow if you adopt the IHRA definition. .
It is a definition that was first formulated for use by the EU for use in collecting data to monitor hate speech, and it was ultimately rejected and is defunct in that context as well. It was never intended for use in this country. The author of the definition, Kenneth Stern, absolutely rejects such use, and most particularly in an academic setting. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/13/antisemitism-executive-ordertrump-chilling-effect
I am an 83 year old Jewish women who is appalled at Israel's 53-year illegal occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and by its crimes against the Palestinian people, I am not an antisemitie, I am a Jew informed by a tradition of pursuing justice.
You have also bowed to lobbying by israel-aligned groups to excise Arab-American studies from the main curriculum. I implore you to reconsider.
Sincerely, Carol Sanders
