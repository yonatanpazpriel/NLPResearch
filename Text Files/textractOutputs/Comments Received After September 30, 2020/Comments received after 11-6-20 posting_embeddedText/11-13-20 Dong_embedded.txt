Subject: Reinstate Arab American studies in
Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear California Dept. of Education Curriculum Committee,
Last Friday, the California Department of Education released the latest round of revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). We were outraged! Despite CA Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond's commitment in August, Arab American studies is not in the Asian American section of the curriculum. The one problematic, watereddown Arab American lesson is relegated to the appendix!
Palestinians have been completely eliminated from the ESMC. On top of that, a proposed definition of antisemitism equates criticism of Israel with antisemitism. This will have a chilling effect on teachers all over California and, by example, all over the United States.
This is not acceptable and I request that Arab American Studies is important for our students and should be taught within the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
Sincerely, Harvey Dong
