I appreciate the Committee's attempts to produce a balanced document on an extremely important and emotional subject matter. I would like the Committee to consider a few suggestions.
1. The section on the Jewish genocide doesn't mention that 6 million Jews were murdered by the Nazis. That astonishingly large number should be emphasized.
2. The discussion of the Polish genocide doesn't mention that of the approximately 5 million Poles who were murdered by the Nazis, 2.7 to 3 million were Polish Jews and 1.8 to 2.77 million were non-Jewish Poles.
3. The section on the Jewish genocide might make clearer that Britain made it extremely difficult for Jews to flee Nazi-occupied Europe, even returning Jews to Europe where they would be killed.
4. The reference at p. 29 to America's disgraceful "locking up [of Japanese] American citizens ... simply because of their race" is well taken, but to call the places where they were locked up "concentration camps" (as the Committee does with single quotation marks) devalues the meaning of that term, and wrongly equalizes America with Nazi Germany. The term "concentration camps" has come to mean centers for mass murder and slavery where people were starved, worked or gassed to death. Disgraceful as what America did, the Japanese were not starved or enslaved or murdered. There was not a genocide of Japanese people in America. Using the term "concentration camps" is misleading, suggesting either that what Nazis did was not so bad since America did the same, or what America did was the equivalent of Nazi policies. I would suggest another term, perhaps "enforced relocation confinement centers". A long phrase, but much more accurate.
Thank you for your consideration. Feel free to contact me if you would like any follow up.
