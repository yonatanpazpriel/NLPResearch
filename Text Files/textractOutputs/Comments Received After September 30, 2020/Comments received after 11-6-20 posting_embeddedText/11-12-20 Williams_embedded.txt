Dear Educators. Here is what I believe should happen in the ethnic studies curriculum. � Pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as
antisemitic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States,
which is white nationalism.
� Please substitute: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
� thanks,
� Lew Williams
