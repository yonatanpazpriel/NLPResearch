Dear ESMC Board,
I'm Rebecca Hitchcock, a San Mateo resident and I was calling today because California is home to more Asians than any other ethnicity group, therefore our curriculum needs to be representative of our State.
I support the Asian American Pacific Islander School Board Members Association's recommendation to restore the Cambodian American and Asian American, and Model Minority lesson plans and to include Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian American lesson plans to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and the revision of Chapter 3 to highlight the Model Minority lesson as foundational to the AAPI unit.
In an effort to move our nation forward towards a more inclusive and respectful society, it is paramount our children learn about the richness and diversity of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community now.
Thank you for the consideration.
Have a great day, Rebecca
