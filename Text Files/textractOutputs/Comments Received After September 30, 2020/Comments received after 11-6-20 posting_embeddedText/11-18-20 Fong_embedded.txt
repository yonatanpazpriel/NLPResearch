From: Laurie Fong Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 1:28 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies model curriculum comment
This is Laurie Fong, Board President Santa Rosa City School District.
I am a 3rd generation American w/Chinese ancestry.
I am a former HS history teacher, HS principal and now President of the Santa Rosa City Schools Board, plus Delegate for Region 3A.
The model curriculum is a guide as pointed out. Districts that write their own will use it as a model but may leave out too much. It must be as robust as possible. If not enough is delineated, information will fall through the cracks and we cannot leave it to chance.
I cried when I researched and discovered the stories of racism and success that I did not teach. The fuller picture was not in curriculum guides and certainly not in textbooks. I taught the success of the Transcontinental Railroad. I taught that Chinese were integral to its success. I did not teach the stories of racist oppression and murder that happened right after this. This information was nowhere to be found in curricula or textbooks. They still are not.
The chance to include this information is now. Please vote to restore the Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC and add the four additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans plus a Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity unit.

We cannot make these groups still the other. They will be if not specifically added. They must be included and we cannot leave it to individual districts/schools.
Thank you,
Laurie Fong President | Santa Rosa City Schools Board of Education
