From: Diane Wolf Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 1:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comment on curriculum
I am a 20+ year resident of Berkeley CA. I am a sociologist, on the faculty at UC Davis. I am also part of the Jewish Studies Program which I directed for 10 years.
I object to using the IHRA definition of antisemitism in your curriculum. That definition was created to be used with regard to countries, not individuals or organizations. Criticism of Israel is not the same as antisemitism just as criticism of the US is not anti-Americanism.
thank you, Diane L. Wolf, Ph.D. Professor of Sociology
