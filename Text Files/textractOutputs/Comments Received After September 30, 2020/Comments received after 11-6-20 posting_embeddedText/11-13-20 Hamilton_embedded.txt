What happens in California education trickles down to education nationwide. Here in Cleveland we have one of the largest Palestinian populations in America; our westside includes a neighborhood dubbed "Little Arabia." Our eastside includes heavily Jewish neighborhoods. To live together in peace and respect It is imperative our children are presented ethnic studies from ALL SIDES, with no side privileging itself with the weaponization of "anti-Semitism"
As an American and as a member of Jewish Voice for Peace Cleveland, I stand with the hundreds of thousands of Jews in American, in Israel and worldwide who passionately know that the legitimization of Israel DOES NOT depend on the delegitimization of Palestine, Palestinian people and Palestinian culture. Please help us all by supporting the demands of the Arab-American Ethnic Studies Coalition.
