From: on behalf of Jessica Song Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 2:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies; ldh; Tony Thurmond Cc: [Emails Redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Political Agenda from CA Ethnic Studies
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
Students and kids are our future, they should taught and educated in an proper way. They should have a critical thinking instead of one-sided political proselytizing.
Please 1) Remove the inflammatory "Guiding Values," which promote radical ideological aims such as "transformative post-imperial resistance," and can be used to justify bringing hate and political dogma into the classroom. 2) Align all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes, and identify those Outcomes as "Guiding Principles and Outcomes."
If any questions, please feel free to ask. Please make sure my concern can be addressed properly.
Yours Sincerely,
Be safe and healthy!
