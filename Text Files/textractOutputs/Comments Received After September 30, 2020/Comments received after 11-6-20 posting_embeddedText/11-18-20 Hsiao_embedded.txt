Dear Education Leader:
I write in support of including more Asian Pacific Islander (API) lessons to the ESMC. The strength of our country is the racial and ethnic diversity. We need to honor the different history, immigration stories, and cultural practices. How racial groups are treated is varied and the history has left an indelible impact on the respective racial groups which can help students understand and shape their self-identify. For example, Japanese Americans were incarcerated during WW II, Chinese Americans faced the Chinese Exclusion and Anti-Miscegenation Acts, and API groups experience reverse-discrimination because of the model minority myth. To not have this background taught would be a great disservice to all students.
Please accept the API School Board Members Association's recommendation to restore the Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC as well as to add four more lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans. I would also like to see Chapter 3 revised to highlight the Model Minority lesson as foundational to the AAPI unit.
Thank you.
Rod
