Comparative Race and Ethnic Studies seeks to take a more intersectional approach to understanding the complexities of race and racism in the United States of America and beyond.
This course challenges students to think, discuss, and critically analyze the intersection of race, ethnicity, culture, gender, socioeconomic status, and sexuality, just to name a few. This course can explore the concept of intersectionality for people of color. Often courses and lessons will focus on the concept of racism without considering the multitudes of identities and struggles held by a person or community of color. These communities are not only experiencing systemic racism, but also economic disenfranchisement, lack of opportunities, or even physical space to call their own.

Students are exposed to not only the causes of intersectional oppression, but also what it means to resist systemic racism. Ultimately, this course considers the wider impact of race and racism on all oppressed communities. This course can explore a wide swath of topics that have affected oppressed communities including but not
