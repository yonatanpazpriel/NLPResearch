From: Eunkyung Park Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 4:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] I'm Korean-American
My name is Eunkyung Park and a Dasom Korean School teacher.
I am here to support the API School Board Members Association's position to restore the Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC as well as to add four more lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans. I would also like to see a Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity unit in Appendix B, like they organize at Stanford University's Ethnic Studies program.
I firmly believe that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum should include Korean American studies in its Asian American studies section. Thank you for your consideration
Best regards
