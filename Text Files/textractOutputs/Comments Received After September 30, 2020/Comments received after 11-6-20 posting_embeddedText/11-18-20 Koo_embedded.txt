From: Amy Koo Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 3:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Inclusive AAPI Unit - public comment
Dear IQC Commissioners,
My name is Amy Koo, and I'm the Northern VP for the API School Board Members Association.
I implore you to restore the Cambodian American and Model Minority lessons as well as to add lessons for Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Indian Americans. I'd like to also see a Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity unit in Appendix B, like they organize at Stanford University's Ethnic Studies program. I'm a 4th generation San Franciscan, and the first time I learned about the stories of those who came before me was watching this year's Asian Americans series on PBS at the ripe age of 46. I know we can and should do better. Through that series I realized that AAPIs did not struggle to be heard alone; they collaborated with other people of color to have a voice and be an integral part of the American fabric. These stories of intersectionality and common cause despite differing backgrounds should be in a Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity unit. --
