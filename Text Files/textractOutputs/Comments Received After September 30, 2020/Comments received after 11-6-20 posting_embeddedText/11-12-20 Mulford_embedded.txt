Your proposed new curriculum fails to meet the standards of freedom of academic inquiry and inclusion.
To claim that any criticism of Israel is anti-Semitic makes no more sense that to claim that criticism about the inappropriateness of a Roman Catholic priest having sex with a minor is anti-Catholic.
Many Jewish organizations, both in the US and throughout the world strongly object to the notion that any criticism of Israel is by definition anti-Semitic. So stating would violate the rights of students to investigate, speak about and protest, Israeli actions which are in violation of international law.
An appropriate definition of anti-semitism is `discrimination against, and/or violence towards and/or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewis. Please use that one.
In this time when our country is finally, hopefully! acknowledging the value of all peoples, ignoring our Arab American children and the factors of their history (for many, having to. flee from Palestine)is a grave disservice. Please restore the story about their history as part of Asian Studies.
Respectfully
