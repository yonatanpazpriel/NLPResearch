Hi,
My name is Justin Feldman, I am a recent UCLA graduate and a Moroccan-Israeli Jewish American. In my time at UCLA, I served on the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Student Advisory Board.
I thank you for considering the adoption of JIMENA's lesson plan: "Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews" and urge you to add it to CA Asian-American Studies alongside ArabAmerican Studies. This lesson is essential to Ethnic Studies because it addresses antisemitism, which has risen to the third highest ethnic-based hate crime in CA.
This includes attacks on the Jewish community from white supremacists AND from fellow persons of color. Criticizing Israel or teaching Palestine is not antisemitic. Relegating Jews and Israel to whiteness and saying the Jewish State is committing genocide - as victims of genocide & white supremacy - is by-definition - antisemitic. President Obama held this understanding of antisemitism, Trump did, and a Biden administration will as well. The CDE must understand Jewish struggles, not gaslight them.
California's State Board of Education's rules require the state's curricula to portray peoples proportionately and not discriminate in favor of or against nationalities, races, ethnicities, and religions. Therefore Middle Eastern Jewish Americans and Arab Americans should be treated equally and placed in the curriculum's Asian American Section.
Thank you,
