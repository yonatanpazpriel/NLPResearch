Hello IQC Committee!
Thank you for time today on the contentious issues of the ESMC. Here is what I would have commented had time permitted.
"Hi, my name is Lauren Post, and I am a concerned community member. I want an ESMC that fairly and sensitively reflects the experiences of my Persian Jewish family. My in laws immigrated from Iran, Tehran specifically, to California. Before coming to the United States as a stateless refugee, my mother in law spent 6 years under house arrest in Iran for the "crime" of being a Jew. My husband was born and raised in California, and it will always be our home. He is a successful product of the California public school system, and we fully intend to educate our own children in public schools. I urge you to adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism that, despite the claims of some Jewish voices you heard today, the vast majority of the Jewish community supports� only Jews can define our oppression for us � no one else. I also encourage the committee to keep the two lesson plans around the Jewish experience in the appendix, and share it as an integral part of the curricula-- do not merely share them via a link to a webpage. Thank you for your work. I look forward to seeing the final product."
Thank you again, Lauren Post
