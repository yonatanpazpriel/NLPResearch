Dear Commissioners:
Regarding the ethnic studies curriculum, pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemitic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism. Please substitute: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
\Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. Arab and Muslim youth are simultaneously invisibilized and targeted. Arab youth have learned little about their history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education
The two years of work put into making an ethnic studies curriculum needs to be honored, not eviscerated.
Please reconsider this issue. Lorraine Lerman
