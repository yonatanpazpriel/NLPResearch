From: Maya Santos Sent: Wednesday, November 11, 2020 4:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Members of the IQC:
I am submitting comments in response to the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express concerns regarding the content that has been removed from the Pacific Islander lessons, as well as the lack of Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
I am pleased to see that the CDE and Superintendent Thurmond moved forward to include the Pacific Islander curriculum developed by Pacific Islander Studies Educators. However, I am aware that key content pieces were removed from the draft and thus I want to encourage the commission to:
1. Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hau'ofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam by approving line edits 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion of important PI Studies resources into the ESMC.
2. Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, honoring and including the expertise of the original committee of writers and Pacific Island Studies experts.
3. Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely, Maya Santos
