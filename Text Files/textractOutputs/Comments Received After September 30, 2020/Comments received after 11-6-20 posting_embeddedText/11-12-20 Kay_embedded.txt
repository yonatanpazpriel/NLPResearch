Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
Thank you for some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) Draft #2
I appreciate the addition of the importance of teaching respect for diverse viewpoints and helping students to connect competing sources of information to foster critical thinking. Our responsibility for civic education depends on citizens who are critical thinkers.
I understand that all lessons are based on the Guiding Values and Principles. I am upset that Draft#2 has offensive,one-sided political ideology creating a flawed Draft #2! We as educators MUST do better!
Teachers can't encourage the desired open inquiry of California's History � Social Science Framework when the Guiding Values and Principles force a negative, dogmatic ideology on students.
Here are my major concerns :
REPLACE The Guiding Values and Principles (Ch. 1 p. 8-9, lines 173 � 199)
with Carlos Cort�s' Ethnic Studies Principles and Outcomes, (currently included in the ESMC,
and named The Eight Outcomes of K-12 Ethnic Studies Teaching (Ch. 1, p. 9-14, lines 200 �
336). They are as follows:
(1) Pursuit of justice and equity
(2) Working toward greater inclusivity
(3) Furthering self-understanding
(4) Developing a better understanding of others
(5) Recognizing intersectionality
(6) Promoting self-empowerment for civic engagement

(7) Supporting a community focus
(8) Developing interpersonal communication
While the above recommendation is the best solution, there are other possible options to
ensure a more balanced, accurate, and empowering curriculum, such as replacing specific
words which promote a narrow political agenda in the existing Guiding Values and Principles.
I am a retired HS/ College Instructor.
This draft continues to present biased lessons on Jewish Americans. My family experienced the death of innocent congregants in Poway, Ca. Anti- Israel , anti-semitism is a cancer on our democratic society
The "Guiding Values and Principles" of the ESMC directly reference and are partly based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom.The relevant section of Education at War also states, "Schools are battlefields where war is waged..."
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please
revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Respectfully,
