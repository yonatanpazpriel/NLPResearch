To whom this may concern,
I called in to the 11/18 meeting on the above topic, but wasn't able to speak. So here I am sending in an email to support the action:
My name is Maggie Tsai, a parent to a student of Saratoga High School, in Saratoga, California. I speak in strong support to the API School Board Members Association's position to restore the Cambodian American lesson and Asian American and The Model Minority lesson to the ESMC, as well as adding additional four lessons for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Ameridans and Indian Amerians.
With what is happening currently, I believe it is critical that we have an inclusive and comprehensive ethnic studies curriculum so our students can gain better understanding and appreciation of different ethnic and cultural groups and their contributions to this country. And I believe we also have the resources for this curriculum. As a parent, I thank you deeply for your initiative and efforts, and really look forward to this happening soon. Thank you!
Cheers,
Maggie Tsai, parent
