From: Andrea Beth Damsky Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 12:12 AM To: Superintendent [email redacted] Cc: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Superintendent Thurmond, Ms. Gregson, Ms. Coates, Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, and Members of the California Department of Education,
I am writing regarding the newest version of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am happy to write in support of the California Department of Education (CDE) recommendations, and urge the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to adopt the proposed changes introduced last week. I also support the inclusion of Sikh-Americans, Armenian-Americans, and other minority communities. I encourage the CDE to meaningfully include and distribute the appendix as an integral part of the model curriculum. Please continue to support the inclusion of the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and continued conversations with mainstream Jewish communal institutions. It is proper that mainstream Jewish organizations should be in charge of defining antisemitism. The IHRA definition has been widely adopted by the international Jewish community for its comprehensiveness. Also, please reject pressure from fringe anti-Israel groups which are attempting to undo the progress which has been made regarding these recommendations. Anti-Zionist voices do not represent the Jewish community and are not acting in good faith to stop antisemitism. Finally, I want to thank Superintendent Thurmond and the CDE for your hard work. This newest draft is finally on its way to fulfilling the core call of inclusion and education of AB 2016.
Respectfully,
Andrea Beth Andrea Beth Damsky
