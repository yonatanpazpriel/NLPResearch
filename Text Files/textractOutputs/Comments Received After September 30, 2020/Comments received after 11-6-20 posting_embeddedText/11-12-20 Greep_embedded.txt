Please do not eliminate Arab American studies from ethnic studies in K-12 curriculum. Arab Americans are a minority group who is at risk of being marginalized and stereotyped as muslim people potentially associated with 9/11 and terrorist groups. This mistaken impression must be countered and corrected to show that they are a diverse group of many religious faiths but share a common geographic origin. Furthermore, California is home to the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the US, with many concentrated in Los Angeles. In addition, it is a mistake to assume that harboring a negative view of Israel is equivalent to being antisemitic. Negative views of Israel have more to do with its policies than its Jewish population. Indeed many Jews do not approve of Israel's policies towards its own Arab residents and Palestinians.
