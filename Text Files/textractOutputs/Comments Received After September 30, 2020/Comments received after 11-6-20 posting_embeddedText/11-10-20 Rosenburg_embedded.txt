Greetings,
I write to you as a Jewish woman and as the ED of Media Alliance, a Bay Area democratic communications advocate. I want to be frank. I grew up in a family that leaned toward the Zionist interpretation of history. While I have moved away from those beliefs in adulthood, I have always understood the trauma that led to the founding of Israel.
However, I want my children and everyone else's children to understand the world. I want them to understand the conflicts, the bloodshed and the struggles for liberation. I want them to hear the fullness of history, including the disagreements and differing characterizations. I would never want my child to experience what I did: not hearing the Palestinian side of the story for very many years.
And because I did not understand Palestinian anger at the nation state founded in the name of the religion I was born into, I did not understand things that were said and where other people were coming from, not forever, but for a while in my life. I don't wish that on anyone.
School exists to prepare us for life and what we will experience, not to feed us pap that is less complex than real life. In real life, there is a struggle for Palestinian liberation. It belongs in the schools because it belongs in life, just like American history is more than Gone With the Wind and Horatio Alger.
Please do not think that children need you to protect them from the conflicts in the world. They need you to explain them. Well and fully and diversely with true representation of multiple layers of perspective. Don't fail the children about Israel and Palestine to cater to the fears and avoidances of adults. .
Thank you.
