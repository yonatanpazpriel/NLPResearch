TO: the California Department of Education
I am a resident of Oakland, California. My son attended both public and private schools in northern California. My granddaughter currently does.
I am writing to urge the CDE to:
� Reject debunked definitions of anti-semitism contained in the curriculum or sample lesson plans that equate criticism of Israel with anti-semitism. Offer this simple but powerful definition as an alternative: Anti-semitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
I also strongly support the following measures:
� Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the CA Dept of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place - within Asian American studes.

� Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, de-colonial and liberatory.
