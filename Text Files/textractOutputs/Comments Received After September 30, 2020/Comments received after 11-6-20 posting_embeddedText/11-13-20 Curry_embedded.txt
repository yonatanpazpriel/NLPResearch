Dear CDE,
The following line edit should be present in at least three parts of your curriculum, "The genocide of Black/African American peoples within the United States as part of their ancestral legacies within this country, since enslavement, is evident based on the United Nations five part definition of genocide". Specifically, we recommend this be included in the following lines:
Lines 1610-1621: Populations Displaced by War and Genocide
Lines 1213-1217: in the African American Studies course outline
Lines 14963-14968: as a note in the paragraph referring to the Human Rights and Genocide Model Curriculum, which explicitly does not recognize the genocide of Black/African American people, and/or Native American people, which is an injustice on both ends.
Thank you for recognizing how necessary this acknowledgment is in the moments we are living in, and for helping to redress this in your Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely, Will Curry
