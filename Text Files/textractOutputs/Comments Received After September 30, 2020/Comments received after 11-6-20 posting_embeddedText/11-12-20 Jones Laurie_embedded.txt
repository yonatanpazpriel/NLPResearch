Superintendent Thurmond & Chair Darling-Hammond:
Especially considering the public racism of the current federal administration & the nation unrest & protests re social justice issues, Arab studies needs to be included in ethnic studies at least with Asian studies. Personally, I have recently had classes in humanities of both the Middle East & Asia. This information is not readily available. Both students with & without Arab heritage need this exposure & education. Arab students need to be validated & protected by the consequent wider understanding of others & non-Arab students need to see & consider the Arab cultural, spiritual, historical, artistic, & human perspective. Israel should not dictate the definition of anti-semitism because their intention is to make it so broad as to make themselves immune to criticism, creating a "bullet-proof" atmosphere where the motives of any criticism are suspect & vulnerable to charges of their definition of anti-semitism. They seek to squelch any human rights concerns regarding Israel's actions. Even many Jewish groups do not agree with this approach. In the interest of fairness, human rights, social justice, & freedom of speech, please include Arab studies in ethnic studies, as originally proposed.
In peace with justice,
