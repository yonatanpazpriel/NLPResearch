Hello,
I am a proud Jewish American and a born and raised Californian who would like to voice my support for the demands that groups like Arab American Resource Center have put forward demanding that all lesson plans align to the guiding principles of Ethnic Studies, and that Arab American studies remain in its rightful place within Asian American studies, that specifically content on Palestine be included in the Arab American lesson plan.
I am especially concerned about attempts by pro-Israel groups that falsely claim to speak on behalf of all Jews to hijack this initiative and attempt to implement harmful, reductive, and debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. As a Jewish American who rejects the racist, ethno-nationalist project of Israel and Zionism, definitions that conflate antisemitism (a hatred of the Jewish people) with anti-Zionism (a political position opposed to the political project of Zionism) silence me and further attack and demonize my Palestinian and Arab siblings. They have no place in Ethnic Studies curriculum.
I would also like to voice my support for ensuring that Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression as seen in the work of Epeli Hau'ofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam. I also urge you all to approve line edits 384, 385, 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion of important PI studies resources, discussion questions, and distinctions between regions in Oceania into the ESMC.
Thank you, Anna T.
