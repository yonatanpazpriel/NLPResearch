re: Arab American Ethnic Studies
Dear Commissioners:
I urge you to include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Dept. of Education by the members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in the the Asian American Studies curriculum. Please do not relegate Arab American Studies to what amounts to a mere footnote by putting a token Arab American plan in the appendix of the Asian American Studies curriculum.
All lesson plans in Ethnic Studies should follow anti-racist, decolonial and liberators guiding principles. I urge you also to reject any definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of the government of Israel with antisemitism. Moreover, if the curriculum contains an appropriate definition of antisemitism, which it should, there should also be an appropriate definition of Islamophobia.
Now, after enduring waves of overt discrimination and violent hate crimes, particularly since 2001, Arab Americans should not have to endure an official slap in the face by the California Dept. of Education by being

excluded from the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Thank you for considering my views.
