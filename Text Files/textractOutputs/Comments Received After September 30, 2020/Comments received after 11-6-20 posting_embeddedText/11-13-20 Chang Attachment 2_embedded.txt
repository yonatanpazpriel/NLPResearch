16 Lesson Overview:
17 This 3 day lesson introduces students to the complexity of the term `Asian American,' 18 ultimately coming to understand the various ethnic groups and politics associated with 19 the identity marker. Additionally, students will also be exposed to the concept of the 20 model minority myth. This course will provide for students the implications that result 21 when lumping all Asian groups together and labeling them the Model Minority. For 22 example, marginalized groups (i.e. Pacific Islanders, Southeast Asians) suffer from 23 being cut out of programs and resources. It presents a false narrative that Asian 24 Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) have overcome racism and prejudice. It glosses 25 over the violence, harm and legalized racism that AAPIs have endured, i.e. the Chinese

26 massacre in Los Angeles 1871, the annexation of Hawaii, shooting of Southeast Asian 27 school children in Stockton. Furthermore, students will understand how this label for 28 AAPIs becomes a hindrance to expanding democratic structures and support, and worst 29 how it creates a division among the AAPI community and places a wedge between 30 them and other oppressed groups including but not limited to African American, Latinx, 31 and American Indian communities.

32 Key Ethnic Studies Terms and Concepts: 33 Assimilation, stereotype, identity, model minority myth, racism, anti-blackness, data 34 disaggregation

35 Lesson Objectives: Students will be able to

36

1. Analyze the misconceptions of the model minority to describe Asian Americans

37

and Pacific Islanders.

38

2. Differentiate the various identities, nationalities, and ethnicities that make up the

39

Asian American and Pacific Islander community.

40

3. Learn to analyze statistical data and legislation that directly impacts communities

41

of color.

42

4. Actively dispel stereotypes and the model minority myth

43 Essential Questions:

44

 What does Asian American mean? And who is Asian American and Pacific

45

Islander?

46

 How has the model minority myth been used to oppress and/or stymie certain

47

Asian American and Pacific Islander communities?

48

 What are the dangers of the model minority myth?

49

 What are ways you can dispel the model minority myth?

50 Lesson Steps/Activities:

51 Day 1
52 1. Place four large pieces of flip chart paper in each corner of the room along with three

53

to five markers. Engage the class by asking students What does Asian American

54

mean? What does Pacific Islander mean?

55 2. Before delving too deeply into discussion, divide the class up into four groups. Each

56

group is assigned to a corner and instructed to take ten minutes as a group to

57

respond to the aforementioned question. Also ask the groups to list the various

58

ethnic groups that comprise `Asian American and Pacific Islander'.

59 3. After about ten minutes, signal for the groups to stop what they are doing. Allow

60

each group to share what they discussed with the class. After each group has

61

shared, provide a definition for Asian American and Pacific Islander and begin listing

62

some of the various ethnic groups (see below for a sample list).

63

Sample Ethnic Groups (this list is in no way exhaustive - listed in the order of

64

population according to the 2010 Census):

65

Chinese

66

Definition of Asian American: The term Asian American was born out of the Asian

86

American Movement (1968-1975) as a means of identifying people of Asian descent

87

living in the United States. During the late 1960s, the term was largely seen as

88

radical and unifying, a rejection of `oriental' and other pejoratives that were

89

associated with people of Asian descent. The collective coining of the term was an

90

act of self-naming and self-determination, and aligned with the broader goals of the

91

Asian American and Pacific Islander movement--equality, justice, and anti-racism.

92 4. After sharing the definition and ethnic groups listed above, reiterate that Asian

93

American and Pacific Islander is a loaded term that encompasses dozens of

94

different Asian ethnic groups that have settled in the U.S., with large populations

95

settling in California.

96 5. Ask students if what impact stereotypes on a group this diverse might have on

97

groups of people who are stereotyped? Then ask students if they know what the

98

model minority myth is. If students are able to answer, move to the article. If not,

99

describe the model minority myth and explain to the students that they will be

100

examining the effects of racial stereotypes that are perceived to be positive can in

101

fact be harmful. For example, the teacher can describe the effects of stereotype

102

threat.

103 6. Ask students to read the article "'Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial

104

Wedge Between Asians And Blacks' in Code Switch (see link in resource list). Note

105

that this article references William Petersen's 1966 New York Times article that

106

inherently pitted Japanese Americans (arguably Asian Americans more broadly)

107

against African Americans, with Petersen identifying the latter group as the "problem

108

minority." Following internment, Japanese Americans were able to achieve some

109

level of social and economic mobility, rendering them the "model minority," for their

110

ability to thrive in the face of adversity unlike their African American counterparts.

111

After reading the NPR piece, explain to students that the Petersen article is first time

112

the term "model minority" was used (or coined) and marks the beginning of the

113

stereotyping of Asian Americans as inherently "smart" and "successful". Ask

114

students to reflect on the main points of the NPR article and discuss how and why

115

the model minority myth is used as a wedge group.

116 7. Tell students that they will gain an understanding of the diversity of AAPI

117

communities by exploring statistics on education and poverty. Split the class into

118

groups of three and instruct half of the groups to review educational data and the

119

other half economic data.

124

125

Each student group will report their findings to the class. Each group will write

126

their findings for their assigned part on the board or a sheet of poster paper. For

127

example, one group can describe how Asian American and Pacific Islander

128

groups vary in terms of reading and math test scores; another group can

129

summarize the educational attainment of various Pacific Islander groups.

130

131 For homework, have students answer the following questions. Students can use the

132 resources at the end of the lesson to help them answer the questions. Tell students that

133 each question requires at least two examples/arguments:

134

- How are Asian American and Pacific Islander ethnic groups similar and different

135

in terms of their education and economic experiences?

136

- How might the "model minority myth" be an obstacle for advancement for Asian

137

Americans?

138

- How can the "model minority myth" be used to drive a wedge between Asian

139

Americans and other communities of color in policies and services.

140

- Knowing that AAPIs are not a monolithic "model minority" and that each ethnic

141

group fares differently economically and educationally, how might policies

142

change to be more inclusive of those groups in need in terms of jobs, services,

Arguments of the Model Minority Myth All Asians are smart and successful

Counter Arguments to the Model Minority Myth
Not all AAPI are successful and rich, in fact the majority are working class and live in poverty. Especially when data is disaggregated by ethnic group for example the poverty rate among Pacific Islanders, Cambodian and Hmong Americans is considerably higher than Indian and Chinese Americans. Lumping all Asians together, covers over the disparities within and among the AAPI population. It renders these groups invisible and hurts the poorest groups who need financial aid and assistance. (if there are Asian students in the class, make an effort to draw out their experiences in group and whole class discussions as a part of sharing their stories)

Arguments of the Model Minority Myth Asians are the model minority because they overcome adversity better than African Americans

Counter Arguments to the Model Minority Myth
It's a form of anti-black racism. The model minority myth has been used to put a wedge between the AAPI and African American communities and is an effort to peel off AAPIs from the Civil Rights Movement. It has also been used by the media to disparage the African American community for standing up for their rights. "During World War II, the media created the idea that the Japanese were rising up out of the ashes [after being held in incarceration camps] and proving that they had the right cultural stuff," said Claire Jean Kim, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. "And it was immediately a reflection on black people: Now why weren't black people making it, but Asians were?" These arguments falsely conflate anti-Asian racism with anti-black racism, according to Kim. "Racism that Asian-Americans have experienced is not what black people have experienced," Kim said. "Sullivan is right that Asians have faced various forms of discrimination, but never the systematic dehumanization that black people have faced during slavery and continue to face today." Asians have been barred from entering the U.S. and gaining citizenship and have been sent to incarceration camps, Kim pointed out, but all that is different than the segregation, police brutality and discrimination that AfricanAmericans have endured." (Chow, Kat) It is important that AAPIs not only stand up for their rights but also stand with African Americans in support of the Black Lives Matter Movement and support the end to police brutality. Justice for one oppressed group leads to justice for all.

All Asians are good at math and computers, they are nerdy.

Not all AAPIs are good at math or want to be mathematicians or scientists. Parent, peer, media pressure to do well in math and become a scientists, doctor or lawyer is very limiting to AAPI youth, and causes them to feel like failures, if they don't live up to these stereotypes.

(Counter Argument)

149

150 Day 2

151 1. Start the class by asking students to share their counter arguments with the groups

152

that they were in yesterday. After each group mate has shared their counter

153

arguments, ask the groups to share what they believe to be the strongest counter

154

argument with the entire class.

155 2. Be sure to provide your own analysis of Petersen's article and a counter argument.

156

Stress that Petersen's article and the term `model minority' helped render `Asian

157

American' monolithic. Also point out that the experience that Petersen mentioned

158

was not reflective of all Asian Americans, as Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander

159

ethnic groups remain largely marginalized and are disproportionately impacted by

160

poverty, mental health issues, low-wage jobs, access to higher education, among

161

other barriers.

162 1. Start the class by telling students that they will share their answers to the homework

163

questions. Split the class into four groups and assign one question to each group.

164

Have students take notes on their in-group discussion and prepare to report to the

165

rest of the class what answers they came up with.

166 3. To better illustrate the problems with `model minority,' play a short video, "Why Data

167

Matters When It Comes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Education"

168

(see resources). Following the screening, explain what it means to disaggregate

169

data and its connection to the model minority myth.

170 4.2. Point back to the flip chart papers around the room that lists the various ethnic

171

groups within AAPI. Underscore how this term that was intended to be a unifying

172

identity-marker has created some problems, including rendering smaller ethnic

173

groups (often those in the most need) less visible, and not being inclusive enough of

174

a term, especially for those of the Asian diaspora that have origins from islands in

175

the Pacific (i.e. Filipinos, Melanesians, Polynesians, etc.), hence the more updated

176

identity-marker, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

177 5.3. During the second half of class hand out copies of the law signed by Governor

178

Brown on September 25, 2016 California Assembly Bill 1726 (Data Collection). Have

179

students take turns reading the bill aloud popcorn style. After the in-class reading,

180

provide necessary context on what a bill is, and summarize how bills become laws.

181

Additionally, define any words or terms students may be struggling with. In groups,

182

have students discuss the purpose of the bill, impact that it will have on AAPI

183

communities, and how the legislation helps dispel the model minority myth.

184 6.4. As homework, ask students to complete a "mini bill analysis" of Assembly Bill

185

1726 using the worksheet below.

186

187 Day 3

188 The key method to dispel the model minority myth is by telling the true stories of

189 yourself, your family and your community. By writing down, speaking aloud and sharing

190 your stories, you actively counteract the stereotypes and master narrative developed to

191 pigeon hold Asian American and Pacific Islanders as a monolithic group with one

192 identity, one experience and one role. No AAPI individual fits the model minority

193 stereotype in all its facets. Take time in your class for students to first Think, Write, and

194 then Share on 3 questions:

195

1. What is your ethnic background?

196

2. What stereotype is there of your ethnic group that you do not identify with?

197

Why? Explain in detail with facts about your experience, your background, your

198

values, your goals, your dreams, your family, your community.

199

3. How will you actively dispel these stereotypes?

200

201 Application, Action, and Reflection: Students will read and analyze an article,

202 demographic data, and a legislative document, providing their own informed critiques,

203 opinions, and feedback on the sources. Students will further analyze how the document

204 supports or argues against the model minority myth. Students will also tell their stories

205 as a way to dispel the harmful stereotypes that the media and society imposes on their

206 ethnic group.

258 by American society. They didn't want to be viewed as a threat to national security like 259 Japanese Americans were when they were imprisoned during WWII. Instead, they 260 wanted to be seen as "good Americans" and desired to assimilate and Americanize, 261 which developed into the idea of the "model minority myth," recasting Asian Americans 262 as prime examples of representing the quintessential American values of opportunity, 263 meritocracy, and the American Dream. Toy Len Goon, the first ever Asian American 264 named American Mother of the Year in 1952 was an early example of what it meant to 265 be a "model minority."
266 During the 1960s, as the Civil Rights Movement continued the fight for equality of all 267 Americans, and the federal government invested in social welfare programs such as the 268 War on Poverty and Great Society, the concept of the "model minority" became a 269 stereotype used to pit Asian Americans against other communities of color, particularly 270 Black Americans. News publications ran articles extolling the ways Asian Americans 271 capitalized on the American Dream with their work ethic and emphasis on education. By 272 doing this, it delegitimized centuries of systemic oppression and racist policies that 273 shaped the experiences of Black Americans.
274 This stereotype also hid how Asian Americans were discriminated against based on 275 racist policies, such as being excluded from living in certain neighborhoods and from 276 being fully accepted members of American society. It created a limited perspective on 277 the Asian American community, where they were seen as one monolithic group. In 278 reality, this community has consisted of diverse ethnicities from a variety of countries 279 and cultures, comprising over ten different languages. Thus, socio-economic success 280 was not universal, and praising Asian Americans as a "model minority" called into 281 question the fact that there were many within the community who did not get the 282 services and government assistance they needed.
283 The "model minority myth" has persisted well after the stereotype developed. Media 284 publications such as Time's 1987 cover story "Those Asian American Whiz Kids" and 285 articles analyzing the work ethic of Asian Americans in response to Amy Chua's 2011 286 book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother illustrated that the "model minority myth" is still 287 being perpetuated.
