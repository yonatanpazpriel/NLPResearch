My comment prepared for the public comment session today.
My name is Dukhyun Cho, the principal of Monterey Korean School. It is my strong desire that you accept the API School Board Members Association's recommendation so that Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC are restored.
In addition, please add four more lesson plans for Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans.
I would also like to see Chapter 3 revised to highlight the Model Minority lesson as foundational to the AAPI unit.
As a college professor and the father of 3 daughters who were born and raised in this great country, I have witnessed the importance of Ethnic Studies for the great state of California.
Thank you.
