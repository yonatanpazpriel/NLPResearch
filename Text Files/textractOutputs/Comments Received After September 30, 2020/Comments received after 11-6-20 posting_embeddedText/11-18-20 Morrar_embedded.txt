Hello I was cut off from making a public comment. Here is my statement.
My name is Maisa Morrar, I am with the Palestinian Youth Movement, and a physician assistant in the Bay Area. The relegation of Arab American Studies to the appendix of the model ethnic studies curriculum is unacceptable and reflects a blatant sidelining of histories crucial to an understanding of racial justice. The revised lessons no longer highlight contributions and struggles against structural racism and social, political, and economic marginalization. Ethnic Studies emerged as an important attempt to counteract the ways that education has historically served as an arm of racist oppression and dispossession in this country. This is why we are Demanding that the IQC Aligns all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory. The Association for Asian American Studies states: "Arab American studies has been part of the broader field of Asian American studies for nearly two decades and ethnic studies since its inception 50 years ago." It is absolutely crucial for us as arab citizens of the US to feel we have representation within our education institutions and to take this right away is nothing but an insult to our rights to access of true knowledge.
