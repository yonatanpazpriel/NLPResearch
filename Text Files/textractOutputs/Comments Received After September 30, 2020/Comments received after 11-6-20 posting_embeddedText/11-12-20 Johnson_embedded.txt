I am a 71 year-old science teacher in California, but I'm very interested in my students getting the whole truth about politics and history as well as science. Despite CA Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond's commitment in August, Arab American studies is not in the Asian American section of the curriculum. One problematic, watered-down Arab American lesson is relegated to the appendix!
Palestinians have been completely eliminated from the ESMC!
Students cannot make decisions or understand current history without an understanding of the Arab world. They can never understand 911 or any of the other historic events without studying all people's histories. The west has been involved in the rest of the world, so our students need to be, too.
Thank you, Patricia Capen Johnson
