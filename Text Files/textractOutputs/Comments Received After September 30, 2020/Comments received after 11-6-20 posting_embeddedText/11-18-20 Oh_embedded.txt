From: Suzie Oh Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 3:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Cc: Dr.Suzie Oh Subject: [EXTERNAL] IQC Public Comment on ESMC
My name is Dr. Suzie Oh. I represent the IKEN (International Korean Educators Network).
Korean Americans have been in the United States since 1903 for 117 years.
It is crucial that students learn about the struggles and the contribution of Korean Americans.
I am here to support the API School Board Members Association's position to add four more lesson plans for Korean Americans, Japanese Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans. I would also like to see a Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity unit in Appendix B, like they organize at Stanford niversity's Ethnic Studies Program
Thank you..
Dr. Suzie Oh Educational Consultant Former Principal, LAUSD
