My name is Faryal Ismatt please adopt the lesson plan on arab American studies written by the original writers. It's important for our children to know that we matter and the struggles our parents have gone through is to be mentioned in the history of how we have survived. We are contributing to this society as citizens and we are as important as every other race. To erase the palestinian American experience and migration is a disservice to our community and to all American students. Arab Americans should be in Asian American studies, just as all the ethnic studies professors will tell you where it belongs. Thank you Best Faryal Ismatt
