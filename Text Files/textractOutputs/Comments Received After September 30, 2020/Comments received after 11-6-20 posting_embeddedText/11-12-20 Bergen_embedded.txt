As a Jew who is critical of Israel while also being deeply concerned about antisemitism, I strongly object to the use of an antisemitism definition that conflates criticism of Israel with hostility toward Jews. Do not use this flawed definition.
Please use a straightforward definition of antisemitism such as this: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
Thank you for your consideration.
