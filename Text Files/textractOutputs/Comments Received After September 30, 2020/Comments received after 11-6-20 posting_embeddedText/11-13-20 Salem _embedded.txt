Dear Instruction Quality control commission,
My name is Rana Salem and I'm a 12th grade Arab student at Balboa High in San Francisco, CA. I am emailing to affirm that Arab American studies should remain under Asian-American ethnic studies, and should not be in the appendix.
I feel seen for the first time by this decision. As an Arab youth, when I first heard that we were going to be included, I felt relieved. I truly believe that this is the first step in combatting the racism, orientalism, and Islamophobia that exist in our society.

Please reconsider this decision, and incorporate the demands which are:

�

Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of

Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.

�

Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies.

�

Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist,

decolonial and liberatory.

�

Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with

antisemitism.

Best,

Rana Salem
