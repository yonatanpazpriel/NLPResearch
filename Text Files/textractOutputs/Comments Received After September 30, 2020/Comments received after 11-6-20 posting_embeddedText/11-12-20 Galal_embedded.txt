From: KGalal Sent: Thursday, November 12, 2020 11:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I urge the California Department of Education (CDE) to restore Arab American narratives and lesson plans to the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum, and not to adopt lesson plans which irresponsibly and unjustifiably equate criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. Such changes to curriculum are an attempt to advance a dangerous revisionist history that masks a legacy of gross human rights violations that must be brought to light so that it is less likely to be repeated. Just as the CDE would not give credence to Holocaust denial, it is not appropriate for the CDE to suppress historical accounts of the ethnic cleansing and dispossession of Palestinians that have been documented by respected Israeli and American historians, academics, and numerous international human rights organizations.
Sincerely,
Ken Galal

The indigenous Palestinians made up the two-third majority, down from 90 percent at the start of the Mandate. One third were Jewish newcomers, i.e., Zionist settlers and refugees from the war torn Europe, most of whom had arrived in Palestine since the 1920's."
