Dear The Instructional Quality Commission:
� Our children are once again being left to fend for themselves in an increasingly racialized and
polarized political climate. California should be a sanctuary, not a place of danger for our students
and their families.
� Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. Arab and
Muslim youth are simultaneously invisibilized and targeted. Please vote to reinstate ethnic studies of a Arab Americans. Support Inclusion of Arab Americans in CA Ethnic Studies Program. Respectfully, Here are our coalition demands:
� Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education by
members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies.
� Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and
liberatory.
� Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Thank you Wedad S.Schlotte Department of the Navy Electronics Engineering manager Quality Manager. American Arab Anti Discrimination Committee (ADC)
-Regards Wedad
