I appreciate the committee's attempt to include various genocides around the world but I object to including the Jewish-Polish genocide with the statistics relating to Polish sufferings at the hands of the Nazis. They should be completely separated.
The goal of Nazi actions against Jews was their complete annihilation and was based on religion, but which the Nazis considered a race. The deaths of Polish Jews was not because they were Polish but because they were Jews.
Jews and Poles both suffered terribly, but the Nazis were not trying to annihilate all Poles. Jews, on the other hand, were targeted for complete annihilation because of their religion and were considered Jews if they had Jewish ancestors, whether or not they were practicing the Jewish religion, even if they had converted to another religion.
Including the Jews in the Polish statistics obfuscates the special targeting of the Jews of Poland and exaggerates the number of Polish victims as Poles.
