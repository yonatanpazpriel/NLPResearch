Dear Sirs:
I am joining the numerous calls for continued improvement of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. First off, your Ethnic Studies Curriculum is misguided in the first place and destroys the fabric that binds this nation together, and will create a generation of nihilstic citizens who view the United States as a destroyer of cultures instead of the land of liberty that it is (albeit imperfectly at times).
As a resident with a grandchild that will be entering the public school system in a few years, I am closely monitoring how the Ethnic Studies Curriculum is rolled out, as it will affect my decision on whether to financial support my grandchild (ren) enrollment in public schools or private.
Your removal of negative content from the initial draft and the acknowledgement that anti-Semitism is a form of hate is laudable. However, if this curriculum is going to be effective and appropriate for all Californians there must be a renewed commitment to transparency in every step of this curriculum's creation, added safeguards to what can be taught in this curriculum, and have more inclusive representation for the experience of Jewish Americans and the broad spectrum of diversity within the Californian Jewish community.
Some ideas: 1) Include broad Jewish American experiences and teach about anti-Semitism 2) Ensure that denigrating content about Jews and Israel ï¿½ including support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement -- is excluded 3) Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity of Jewish Americans 4) Recommit to transparency and the predetermined process of writing the ESMC. Thank you for the consideration.
Sincerely California Resident, Robin Goldfinger
