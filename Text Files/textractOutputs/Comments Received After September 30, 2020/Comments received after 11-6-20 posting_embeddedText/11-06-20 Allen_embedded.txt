Hello,
Can I please have more information regarding the third world liberation front that is supposed to be included in my childs curriculum? Do you have any other information that states what this teaches or what this is about? This is extremely vague and I would like to know exactly what is being taught in the classrooms regarding this movement. Thank you!
