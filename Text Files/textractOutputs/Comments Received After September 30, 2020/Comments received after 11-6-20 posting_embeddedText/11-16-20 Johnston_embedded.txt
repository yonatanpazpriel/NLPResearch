From: Dori Ben-David Johnston Sent: Monday, November 16, 2020 7:23 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Tony Thurmond Cc: [redact emails] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Political Agenda from CA Ethnic Studies
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am deeply concerned about the current ESMC's Guiding Principles and the political agenda they clearly seek to infuse into the curriculum. I am requesting that the Commission replace these Guiding Principles with tried-and-true "Eight Outcomes of K-12 EthnicStudies Teaching."
The details of this concern are outlined in the letter recently submitted by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.
As you review Submitted Line Edits #48-51, please keep in mind that thousands of Californians, including >100 educators, had submitted requests to:
1) Remove the inflammatory "Guiding Values," which promote radical ideological aims such as "transformative post-imperial resistance," and can be used to justify bringing hate and political dogma into the classroom. 2) Align all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes, and identify those Outcomes as "Guiding Principles and Outcomes."
Thank you for your hard work in ensuring that our students' Ethnic Studies education is fully of integrity and intellectually honest.
Sincerely,
Dori Ben-David Johnston
