From: Malek Najjar Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 10:52 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American Ethnic Studies
To The Instructional Quality Commission, California Superintendent for Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, California Board of Education Linda Darling-Hammond:
I am writing to ask that you reconsider placing Arab American Studies in the appendix of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). By doing so will relegate Arab American Studies as a footnote to American history when its rightful place within Asian American Studies (the socalled "Middle East" is in Southwest Asia). Also you should consider aligning all lesson plans to your guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial, and liberatory in nature. We reject the notion that Arab American Studies is anti-Semitic. Arabs are Semites. Also, criticism of the Israeli government should not be conflated with anti-Semitism.
Please reconsider what you are doing. Arab Americans comprise a large part of California's rich cultural mosaic and have contributed to the state for decades. They deserve a rightful place in the curriculum. You know this to be true.
With Respect, Michael Malek Najjar, PhD, MFA Associate Professor University of Oregon
