From: Rabbi Mark Bloom Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 1:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on Revised Draft of Curriculum
My name is Mark Bloom, and I am a Rabbi in Oakland, where I have worked for 20 years. I am also married to a public school teacher, have one child in college, and one at a public High School in California.
As a Rabbi in the Bay Area, I have seen the positive and the negative of Ethnic Studies, as some of my High School Confirmation students have brought fascinating ethnic comparisons from what they learned in class, and I have also seen students bring in stories from their ethnic studies and social studies classes where their teachers have singled them out for being Jewish or supporting Israel, and encouraged their classes to participate in boycotts against Israel.
I am very glad we will be adopting Ethnic Studies in California, and I really appreciate you taking the time to get it right, as the first draft was filled with antiSemitism and a lack of nuance. I support the recommended changes to the Ethnic
Studies Model Curriculum, which include language that seeks to prevent discrimination against any group in the classroom and support the inclusion of the two lessons on Jewish Americans.
Thank you again for all your hard work.
