From: calethstudies Sent: Monday, November 16, 2020 12:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies; IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] 285 signatures for removing political agenda from ESMC's guiding principles
Dear IQC Members,
You received 285 letters expressing concerns about the politicized Guiding Principles of the ESMC. Due to a software glitch, the body of these emails was empty. Below is the text of the emails, and attached is the list of the signatories.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. --------------------Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am concerned that the thousands of letters that were submitted to you during the September public comment period, asking that the ESMC's Guiding Principles be changed and aligned with the course Outcomes, were not reflected in the tally of responses you published on 11/6/20 as Attachment A, Summary Table of Public Comments.
Please add a category to this summary table to reflect our more than 5,000 concerns about the narrow ideological approach of the ESMC. We believe that our proposed changes to the Guiding Principles are essential to assure that the ESMC is free from one-sided political proselytizing, encourage critical thinking and support tolerance.
The details of this concern, as well as its lack of inclusion in the tally, are outlined in the letter recently submitted by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies.
As you review Submitted Line Edits #48-51, please keep in mind that thousands of Californians, including >100 educators, had submitted requests to:
1) Remove the inflammatory "Guiding Values," which promote radical ideological aims such as "transformative post-imperial resistance," and can be used to justify bringing hate and political dogma into the classroom.
2) Align all lessons only to the impartial Outcomes, and identify those Outcomes as "Guiding Principles and Outcomes."
To accomplish the above, please replace the current Guiding Values and Principles (Ch. 1 p. 8-9, lines 173 � 199) with Carlos Cort�s' Ethnic Studies Principles and Outcomes, (currently included in the ESMC, and named "The Eight Outcomes of K-12 Ethnic Studies Teaching.")
Thank you for ensuring that our comments are properly noted and addressed.
