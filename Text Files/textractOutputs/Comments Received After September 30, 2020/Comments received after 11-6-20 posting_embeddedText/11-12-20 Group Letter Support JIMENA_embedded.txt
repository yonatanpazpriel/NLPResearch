Keep Hate and Bias Out of CA Public Schools
Submitted At 2020-11-13 02:39:46 Please enter your name Miryam Kornfeld Please enter your zip code 11102 Please enter your email [redacted] Personalize your message to CA officals: Dear IQC Members,
I urge you to ACCEPT revisions to the ESMC that will:
1. Include diverse Jewish experiences and accurately define antisemitism in all its forms. 2. Treat Middle Eastern communities equally, including by adding the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA in the same section as the one about Arab Americans. 3. Remove "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms.
I also urge you to REJECT pressure to:
1. Exclude or edit down any definition of antisemitism. 2. Give Arab Americans a special place in the curriculum above Jews, Armenians, Sikhs, Koreans or others. 3. Vote against changes that encourage critical thinking instead of one sided political agendas in the curriculum.
Sincerely, Submission ID 5fadf1f20d9f341360174858
