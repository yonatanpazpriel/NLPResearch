For too long, American youth has learned little about the Arab-American history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education.
Since we are going to change our education curriculum, let's do it right! It's simply irrational to not provide more education on Arab-American studies. Many Americans are ignorant on this subject, and as such, our youth needs to learn about it in order to become more open-minded and more importantly, less hateful of their fellow human beings.
