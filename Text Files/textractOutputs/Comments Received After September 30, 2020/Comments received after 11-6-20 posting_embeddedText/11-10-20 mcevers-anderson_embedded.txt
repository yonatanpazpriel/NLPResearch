Instructional Quality Commission,
I wish to express my concern regarding the removal of the Palestinian narrative from ArabAmerican lesson plans.
While promoting a definition of antisemitism that labels criticism of Israel as antisemitic, there is no consideration given to the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people by Israeli policy and racist laws. Antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish. It has nothing to do with the criticism of policy or actions of a nation. How is one nation given elevated status, even immunity, while at the same time the indigenous people of that land are denied any acknowledgement of their rights, and dignity as a people group, who have endured over 100 years of oppression?
To whom are you listening? Ethnic studies, by its nature, gives voice to and understanding for those who have traditionally been silenced.
I urge you to � Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the CA Dept of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee � Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place - within Asian American studes. � Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory.
Thank you for allowing me to provide input.
Yours sincerely,
Rev Dr John S. Anderson (he/him)
