From: Vaishali Sirkay Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 3:51 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Submitting Public Comment for IQC Meeting Nov 18 Hello, I did not get a chance to give my public comment live so I am submitting it here:
Hello, my name is Vaishali Sirkay and I am an elected Governing Board Member on the Los Altos School District Board of Trustees, as well as the parent of a high schooler.
Please accept the API School Board Members Association's recommendation to restore the Cambodian American lesson and the Asian American and the Model Minority lesson to the ESMC as well as to add four more lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans and Indian Americans. I would also like to see Chapter 3 revised to highlight the Model Minority lesson as foundational to the AAPI unit. Representation matters, and right now, a huge chunk of the CA population is not represented in the current draft. Thank you.
Thank you, Vaishali Sirkay
