Dear Superintendent Tony Thurmond and the Instructional Quality Commission,
I, Zuka'a Joudeh, am appalled by the deliberate action being taken to erase the teaching of Arabic literature, history, culture, and above all people from California teaching curriculums. We, Arab Americans, are people that continue to face oppression and scrutiny from institutions for the sole act of existing in America. Taking away our right to educate and preserve our culture is another racist and insulting way to oppress our community. As a person with relatives, colleagues, and friends in the State of California, I am writing in support of the Arab American community fighting to save their right to equal education and the chance of proper representation in academia. Do not eliminate Arab-American experiences from students' education in California. Not only is this racist and xenophobic, but it also is a major disadvantage that will significantly impact the experiences of all students in the region. I support all demands to Save Arabic American Studies which are the following:
� Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education by
members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies.
� Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial,
and liberatory.
� Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Arab-Americans have a right to exist! You cannot erase us or our narrative. You should be ashamed of the injustice taking place. I will not stay silent and continue to fight with my brothers and sisters in California until this issue receives the justice it deserves.
All Power to the People!
Yours Truly, Zuka'a Joudeh
