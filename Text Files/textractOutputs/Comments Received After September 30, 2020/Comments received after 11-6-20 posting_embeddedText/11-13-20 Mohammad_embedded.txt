We know from the demands of racial justice sweeping this county that it is offensive and dangerous to shunt the histories and perspectives of people of color to the sidelines. These revisions are tone-deaf to the political moment we are living in. We as Arab Americans are once again being left to fend for ourselves in an increasingly racialized and polarized political climate. CA should be a sanctuary, not a place of danger for me and all those like me. Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia. and anti-Arab racism. Arab and Muslim youth are simultaneously invisibilizd and targeted. For too long, Arab youth have learned little to nothing about our history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. ArabAmerican studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education. Pro-Isral interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemetic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speeech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism. Arab-American studies must be saved now and we as Arabs will never stop advocating and fighting for this and for our rights! Change must be made NOW!
