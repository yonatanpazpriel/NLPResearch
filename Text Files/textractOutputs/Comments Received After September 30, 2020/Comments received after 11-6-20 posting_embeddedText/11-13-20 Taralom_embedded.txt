HOW TO TAKE ACTION
M-Power has prepared a New Petition about the situation. Folks should try and sign by this Friday at 12 noon. Public comments need to be emailed to the CA Dept of Education by this Friday at 12 noon also They count quantity, not quality, so it would take 5 minutes of your time. Here is information on taking points and email addresses for public comment:
Send Public Comment to: � The Instructional Quality Commission: ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov
� California Superintendent for Public Instruction Tony Thurmond: [email redacted] � Chair, California Board of Education Linda Darling-Hammond: [email redacted] � Cc: [email redacted]
Talking points:
� Pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemitic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism.
� Please substitute: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish. Other talking points that can be used
� We know, from the demands for racial justice sweeping this county, that it is offensive and dangerous to shunt the histories and perspectives of people of color to the sidelines. These revisions are tone-deaf to the political moment we are living in.
� Our children are once again being left to fend for themselves in an increasingly racialized and polarized political climate. California should be a sanctuary, not a place of danger for our students and their families.
� Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. Arab and Muslim youth are simultaneously invisibilized and targeted.
� For too long, Arab youth have learned little about their history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K12 education HERE is the website for the Save Arab American Studies Coalition that JVP is part of and where you can look for updates as we know them. Thank you very much.
