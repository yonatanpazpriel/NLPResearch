To the Instructional Quality Commission
I am an experienced Los Angeles Unified School District secondary social studies teacher, a past member of the CDEs IMAP process for K-8 social studies, and past member of the H/SS Framework Revision Committee. I applaud the development of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and the outstanding work of the Advisory Board. I also object to the removal of Arab-American studies from the Asian-American Studies section of the ESMC, and relegation to the Appendix. Furthermore, Palestinian people are removed completely in the revised ArabAmerican lesson. This is really unacceptable disparate treatment and could violate Ed Code.
Thanks to decades of U.S. foreign policy, our young Arab-American and Muslim students face the destructive consequences of everyday Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism in our schools and communities. As a teacher, I know that Arab-American studies are a much-needed intervention into racist stereotypes that still prevail in K-12 education.
Like all people of color in the U.S., Arab-Americans have a long and rich history in the development of California and the United States, and should have their rightful place in AsianAmerican studies. Furthermore, pro-Israel groups should not be allowed to fine anti-Semitism in the ESMC, or have the power to delete Palestinians in Arab-American studies.
In fact, the principles of ethnic studies as a social studies discipline-- anti-racism, decolonialism, and justice--should guide all the lesson plans in the ESMC. And the professionals who have developed this discipline should be listened to. The original Arab-American lesson plan by the original ESMC Advisory Committee should be restored and the section should be returned to Asian-American studies.
Sincerely Linda Tubach
