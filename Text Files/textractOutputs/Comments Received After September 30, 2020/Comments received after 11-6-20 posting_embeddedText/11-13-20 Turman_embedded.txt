From: missashat Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 1:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Opposition to changes in latest revision of the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To All Concerned:
I send this letter to express my dismay with the proposed changes to the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It's a travesty in service of revisionist history, bordering on epistemicide. Education should be in the service of crafting young minds to think, that would inspire them to extricate humanity from the entrenchments it has created for itself, not mollify their thoughts into accepting Power where it looms over them.
I urge you to reconsider these changes, and instead bolster the role of social movements in curricula, not mute them. In the end, you cannot contain a real education within the bounds of a curriculum or the walls of a classroom. Students will mature into citizens and see the falsehoods taught them for what they are. It's your choice whether you'd find yourselves in service to their maturation, or as an impediment to it.
Best Regards,
Asha Turman Oakland, CA
