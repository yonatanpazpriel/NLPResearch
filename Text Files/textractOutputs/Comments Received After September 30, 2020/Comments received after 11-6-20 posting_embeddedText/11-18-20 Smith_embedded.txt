ETHNIC STUDIES in CALIFORNNIA STATE EDUCATION
The resistance to openness in the projected Ethnic Studies curriculum as evidenced by the governor's initial veto highlights a one sided resistance by the Pro-Zionist camp. A plea for Holocaust observance and the dangers of antisemitism cannot be isolated from the actual history of the creation of Israel.
Ethnic studies should weigh the celebration of Israel's Independence Day against the Palestinian Nakba. It should include the preceding events of late 1800's into the 20th century highlighting Western intervention in the Middle East, the beginnings of the Zionist movement, and true exposure of the League of Nations and subsequent United Nations decisions that lead to Israel's creation.
If Israel is, in fact, a reaction to horrors of the Holocaust, then the complete history of Herzl, Balfour, the shaping of western opinion, and the unfair partitioning of what had been recognized as Palestine that, at the time, was predominately Arab, a small contingent of Christian, and merely seven percent Jewish. Over 50% of the land area was appropriated to Israel which immediately evolved into the ultimate goal of eliminating the native population (defined by Golda Meir as "a land without a people").
700,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes, villages either destroyed, buried, or occupied by Jewish settlers, a policy which continues today.
The timeline for this period, from inception to the present, is of course much more involved. Cause and effect in this ethnic studies program should be included. If the relevance of this part

of history is ignored, it would be best to remove the whole block of ethnic studies from the program.
Thank you,
