On October 14, 2020, Dr. Jones sent you a letter of concern about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am re-submitting his letter because for some reason it is not listed as being received in the IQC comments box https://cde.app.box.com/s/7q3dfv0rbe1t369htqvwhi30246z688b?page=3
Please see the attached resubmission from Dr. Jones. It is identical to the letter he sent you on October 14, 2020.
Thank you very much.
