Analysis and Recommendations for the November 18th IQC Meeting Regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
The detailed analysis and recommendations below cover proposed changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), which you will be voting on during your November 18th meeting. This includes the submitted line edits in Attachment C and a number of lesson plans that have been edited by the CDE for your review.
Please note that a change submitted by our organization is listed inaccurately in Attachment C: Table of Submitted Line Edits. Our recommended change in item #53 is meant for Chapter 3, page 9, lines 193-204, rather than Chapter 1.
Broadly speaking, we urge you to accept revisions to the ESMC that will:
1. Include diverse Jewish experiences and accurately define antisemitism in all its forms.
2. Treat Middle Eastern communities equally. This means adding the lesson plan submitted by JIMENA in the same section as the one about Arab Americans.
3. Change "Guiding Values and Principles" which can and will be used to justify bringing hate and bias into our classrooms.
We also urge you to reject:
1. Recommendations to exclude or edit down any definition of antisemitism to the point where it no longer reflects the experiences of Jewish students (i.e. by removing references to the fact that anti-Israel rhetoric can and does descend into hate speech against Jews far too often).
2. Pressure to give Arab Americans a special place in the curriculum above Jews, Armenians, Sikhs, Koreans or others. These communities should be treated equally.
3. Demands that you vote against changes that encourage critical thinking instead of one sided political agendas in the curriculum. It is crucial to include guidelines that will help prevent hatred and bias in our schools.

Preface, page 4, lines 66�69

Add a footnote to the term "antisemitism," which reads: "Antisemitism is hatred, discrimination, fear, and prejudice against Jews based on stereotypes and myths that target their ethnicity, culture, religion, traditions, right to self-determination, or connection to the State of Israel."

CDE Recommends If this edit is approved, CDE will make the change throughout the document. [Intentionally blank]

� It is essential to include a comprehensive definition covering antisemitism in all its forms in the curriculum. According to two recent studies, nearly half of Americans don't know the meaning of "antisemitism" and shocking numbers of young people are ignorant about the Holocaust. The definition should be included in full, and not edited down to remove crucial context that reflects the experiences of Jewish students who face this hate.

Commenter suggested adding the following bullets to the Guiding Principles/Outcomes section (specific location not provided):

CDE Recommends

� In K-12 education it is imperative that students are exposed to multiple perspectives, taught to think critically, and form their own opinions.
� Curriculum, resources, and materials should include a balance of topics, authors, and concepts, including primary and secondary sources that represent multiple, and sometimes opposing, points of view or perspectives
� Students will actively seek to understand, analyze and articulate multiple points of view, perspectives and cultures.
� The instruction, material, or discussion must be appropriate to the age and maturity level of the students, and be a fair and balanced academic presentation of various points of view consistent with accepted standards of professional responsibility, rather than advocacy, personal opinion, bias or partisanship

� This change is essential to help ensure the ESMC is not used to promote bias or one-sided political agendas in the classroom, as was the case with the 1st draft of the curriculum. Additional action is also needed to ensure this
guidance is repeated throughout Appendix B, as the current "Guiding Values and Principles" currently are.

Overlaps with recommendation above. Conflicts with the edit below.

� Line edits 47-51 would fix serious problems with the ESMC's "Guiding Values and Principles," helping to ensure that this curriculum does not enable harmful political agendas or hate. For example, item #6 in the current draft reads, "connect ourselves to past and contemporary resistance movements that struggle for social justice on the global and local levels". To see how such language can be used to justify hate in the classroom, look no further than San Francisco State University (SFSU). A program within SFSU's the College of Ethnic Studies planned an event on September 23rd called "Gender, Justice, & Resistance: A conversation with Leila Khaled". Khaled, a member of the PFLP terrorist group, was personally responsible for a plane hijacking that nearly ended in the mass murder of 148 civilians. The professor hosting this event, Rabab Abdulhadi, is cited in Appendix A of the ESMC.

"Ensure that students receive appropriate and nondiscriminatory instruction and materials. Ensure that district guidelines, professional development, syllabi, classroom instructional materials, and other contents of a locally developed ethnic studies course meet requirements for presenting potentially controversial issues in K-12 public school classrooms. While developing instruction and materials, school districts and local education agencies will follow the additions to the Education Code from AB-331 Pupil Instruction: High School Graduation Requirements: Ethnic Studies:
(G) (iv) Instruction and materials for a course described in clause (ii) shall meet all of the following requirements:
(I) Be appropriate for use with pupils of all races, religions, genders, sexual orientations, and diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds, pupils with disabilities, and English learners. (II) Not reflect or promote, directly or indirectly, any bias, bigotry, or discrimination against any person or group of persons on the basis of any category protected by Section 220.

"For example, the Criteria for Evaluating Instructional Materials in the California History-Social Science Framework states that: "Materials include the study of issues and historical and social science debates. Students are presented with different perspectives and come to understand the importance of reasoned debate and reliable evidence, recognizing that people in a democratic society have the right to disagree."5 In addition, districts and LEAs should keep in mind Section 60044 of the California Education Code that schools may not use instructional materials that contain "any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race or ethnicity, gender, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation, occupation." California Education Code, Section 60044.6 An example of guidelines written by a district on how to implement ethnic studies is "Elements of a Balanced Curriculum, adopted by the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Multidisciplinary Ethnic Studies Advisory Team in 2017.7 When districts and LEAs create their own guidelines for teaching ethnic studies in their district, this may serve as a model guideline. LAUSD gathered many district stakeholder groups, found language to summarize how to address balanced pedagogy and instructional materials, and address student and teacher needs in support of teaching ethnic studies.

� The above change would add unpleasant but important context about the TWLF, helping students understand that social movements can promote good ideas about some issues and bad ideas about others. The language above is based on well documented facts which should not be swept under the rug. One of the most prominent leaders of TWLF gave a speech in 1968 in which he, "attacked Jewish people as exploiters of the Negroes in America and South Africa and called for `victory to the Arab people' over Israel," according to a news report from that period. In another speech about TWLF, this same leader said, "it is up to us to make the revolution, to break the system, to smash it, shatter it, and destroy it, as brother Lenin said". Vladimir Lenin was the founder of the Soviet Union, one of the most violent and oppressive empires in history. TWLF also drew significant inspiration from Mao Zedong, the communist dictator of China who was responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of people.

Additional Lesson Plans Edited by the CDE
Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern Americans � JIMENA has requested that this lesson plan be included in the Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies section. If a lesson plan about Arab Americans is included in that section, JIMENA's request should be honored as well. The same is true for all additional lesson plans about Asian American communities that CDE has recommended for inclusion in Appendix B. � The definitions of antisemitism on pages 6-7 of the original version should be included in full, rather than the ones edited by the CDE. The edited versions remove crucial context that is essential for students to fully understand antisemitism. At the very least, the links to these definitions should be added back into the lesson plan: o https://www.adl.org/anti-semitism o https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism
Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race � The original definition of antisemitism should be included in full on page 8, rather than the one edited by the CDE. The edited version removes crucial context that is essential for students to fully understand antisemitism. This is the original definition that should be restored: o antisemitism - Hatred, discrimination, fear, and prejudice against Jews based on stereotypes and myths that target their ethnicity, culture, religion, traditions, right to self-determination, or connection to the State of Israel.
Arab American Studies � Sample Unit Plan
� Page 22 includes a lesson where students watch a stand-up comedy routine in which the comic, Mo Amer, finishes by joking that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and/or the fact that Palestine isn't a state is "all your [Germany's] fault to begin with." While it is unreasonable to expect historical accuracy from comedians, this segment would certainly mislead students about the roots and causes of the conflict.
Important Asian American Historical Figures & Important Historical Figures Among People of Color
� These lessons encourage students to learn "how we should challenge white supremacy today" from specific historical figures, and examine how those figures contributed to "the movement for racial and economic equality." Among the figures listed are:

o Yuri Kochiyama, an activist who praised Chairman Mao and Osama Bin Laden. o Helen Thomas, a prominent reporter who made widely reported antisemitic comments towards the end of
her career. o Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who has been widely criticized for multiple antisemitic comments. o Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who has been widely criticized for antisemitic comments and working
closely with hate groups. o Activist Linda Sarsour, who has a long record of antisemitic actions and statements, close ties to infamous
