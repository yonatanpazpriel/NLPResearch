Arabs deserve to be represented in the ethnic studies curriculum. Their reality has been one of extreme bigotry and stereotyping in this country, especially post 9/11, and especially since the election of Trump and the implementation of a travel ban that has prevented hundreds of Muslims and other Arabs from seeing their families. My culture is never fully represented in media or schools, I only ever learn about the Middle East when we learn about terrorism, early human settlement, or how "oppressed" Middle Eastern women are. Imagine the stereotypes this can generate among an already xenophobic nation that has been taught to be fearful and cautious of Muslims. You have the chance to counteract this by amending the ethnic studies curriculum. Additionally, Arab American studies are essential to understanding orientalism, especially as it pertains to Asian American studies. Reinsert Arab American studies into the ethnic studies curriculum.
