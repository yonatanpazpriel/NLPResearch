-------------------------------------------------------------------------------From: Liat Yardeni Sent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 11:28 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Rabbi Yardeni remarks - Instructional Quality Comission (IQC) meeting about ethnic studies
MY NAME IS RABBI LIAT YARDENI AND I HAVE WORKED IN EDUCATION FOR OVER 25 YEARS.
EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS!
AT THE AGE OF 11 MY GRANDMOTHER IN AUSTRIA WAS STOPPED ON A TRAIN & CALLED A "DIRTY JEW". HER ONLY CRIME WAS BEING JEWISH! Over 90 years later, Ipersonally experienced anti Semitism as a student at UCLA!
AS A RABBI, A MOTHER AND A JEW- I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT:
�THE RISE OF ANTI � SEMISTISM IN the US, and �THE SHOCKING IGNORANCE ABOUT ANTI- SEMETISIM AND THE HOLOCAUST AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE
YOU have an opportunity TODAY to dramatically improve this curriculum. I urge you to do so
* BY ADDING A CLEAR DEFINITION OF ANTISEMITISM THAT REFLECTS THE HATRED TOO MANY JEWISH STUDENTS FACE TODAY.
* DO NOT GIVE IN TO THOSE PRESSURING YOU TO SWEEP ANY FORM OF ANTISEMITISM UNDER THE RUG!

Thank you for listening!
