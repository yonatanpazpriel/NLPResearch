From: Frederick Klein Sent: Saturday, November 28, 2020 9:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support the inclusion of Arab American studies.
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
It may be natural, indeed human nature, to ascribe homogeneous characteristics to people who are different. We must as individuals resist this, and view this particular question with reason. If the history of Italian, Irish, German, Chinese, Japanese, or Jewish Americans was shifted to the appendix of these studies, there would legitimately be outrage. If we include studies of minorities with those of immigration, as is of course logical, we have to include Arab Americans in that study. Not doing so will serve to increase all the horrid stereotypes and racist attitudes which already exist.
Thank you, Frederick Klein [email redacted]
Sincerely, Frederick Klein
