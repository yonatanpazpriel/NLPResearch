To: The Instructional Quality Commission
My name is Hareem Khan, and I am assistant professor of Ethnic Studies and Anthropology at CSU San Bernardino. I'm writing to express my deep concern over the proposed revisions to the ES Model Curriculum, which currently excludes Arab American Studies from the Asian American section of the curriculum. It's concerning that it has been relegated to the appendix and I, along with many others, believe this is wrong.
This year there have been demands for racial justice taking place across the country (and world). It is dangerous, in this moment, to block out the histories of people of color to the sidelines. Additionally, California should be a sanctuary for our students and families and a place where they can engage with these histories thoughtfully and critically.
Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism and an integration of Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education.
Lastly, I want to echo the fact that pro-Israel groups should NOT define antisemitism. Their definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech and censors any advocacy for Palestinian human rights.
Along with others, I ask that the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education be included in the ES curriculum. It should be re-inserted into Asian American Studies. I also support the aligning of all lesson plans to the principles of ES, rooted in anti-racism, decoloniality, and liberation.
I hope you will give our voices serious consideration followed by action. Thank you for your time.
Best, Hareem Khan
