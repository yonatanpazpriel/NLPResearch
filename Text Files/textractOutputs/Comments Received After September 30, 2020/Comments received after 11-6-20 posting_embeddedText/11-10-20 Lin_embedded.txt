Comments on Item 8 History�Social Science Subject Matter Committee
Dear Members of the IQC:
I am submitting comments in response to the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the content that has been removed from the Pacific Islander lessons AND the lack of any Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
I am a second generation Asian American working within the documentary film industry and the Asian American film industry is constantly searching for their ethnic identity because our education erases our dense, complex, and intertwining histories. This is a permeating pattern that ripples.
Removing/not including content, and ignoring demands made by Pacific Islander and Arab American community organizations, are all manifestations of continued erasure.
I am pleased to see that the CDE and Superintendent Thurmond moved forward to include Pacific Islander curriculum developed by Pacific Islander Studies Educators. However, I am aware that key content pieces were removed from the draft and thus I want to encourage the commission to:
- Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hau'ofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam by approving line edits 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion of important PI Studies resources into the ESMC.
- Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, honoring and including the expertise of the original committee of writers AND Pacific Island Studies experts.
- Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism - and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely, Ashley Lin community member
