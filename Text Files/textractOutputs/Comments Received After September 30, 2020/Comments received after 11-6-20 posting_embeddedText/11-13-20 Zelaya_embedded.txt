The Instructional Quality Commission
The Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee absolutely must be included. Criticism of Israel, or any other state, including our own, is our first amendment, constitutionally guaranteed right. We should not sacrifice our right to free speech, to appease any political bullies or anyone else. Humanity has struggled long and hard to liberate itself from ethnic, religious, and racial bigotry. We have learned that diversity is good for the biosphere. It is also good for the cause of equal human rights. Lesson plans for ethnic studies must uphold the principles of self determination of peoples, not colonialism; liberation, not oppression; and a total repudiation of racism in upholding the dignity of the human person regardless of race. Consequently, Arab American studies belongs in its rightful place under the rubric of Asian American studies. Please do not be swayed by any form of bigotry. Respectfully, M.V. Zelaya
