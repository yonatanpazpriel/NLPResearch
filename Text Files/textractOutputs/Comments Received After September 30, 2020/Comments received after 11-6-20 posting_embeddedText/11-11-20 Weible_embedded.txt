Friends,
I'm emailing you to respectively ask that the decisions you make next week will hold at its center the needs for our education curriculum to teach students the whole story--the many narratives that make up our communities, our country and the world. There is a narrative that has taken hold in the United States that needs to be broken down--criticism of the policies of the Israeli government that oppress the Palestinian people is NOT antisemitism but if in making decisions about what is taught in schools, we are not careful, that is the message that we will be perpetuating for generations to come.
Further, Arab American studies is crucial when we see how the narrative after 9/11 has made our Arab American neighbors vulnerable to abuse and violence. If we don't confront this by encouraging accurate curriculum choices, the violence will continue and grow.
For these reasons and more, I respectively ask that you honor the demands of the Arab Resources and Organizing Committee:
� Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education
by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee.
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies.
� Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist,
decolonial and liberatory.
� Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.
The only way to eliminate fear, mistrust, false narratives is to teach the truth and the right history and cultural perspectives. Done well, it has the potential to heal the kinds of wounds we so prevalent in our country today.
Thank you, Diane
