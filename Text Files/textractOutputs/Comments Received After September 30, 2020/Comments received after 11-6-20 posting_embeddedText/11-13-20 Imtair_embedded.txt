Hello, I am a Palestinian youth that's going to high school in the Bay Area. Pacific Islander and Arab American studies is not something that can be put in the appendix. Arab American studies deserves to be in their rightful place which is Asian American studies. Pacific Islander studies shouldn't be as dismissed as it is. To see that my ethnicity is neglected in the back of a book is heart breaking.
