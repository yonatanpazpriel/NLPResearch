From: Julie Maltzman Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 8:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please include the most widely accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism in the curriculum.
Hi,
My name is Julie Maltzman. I am a California mother.
Yesterday the FBI released its 2019 Hate Crime Statistics report. The By Religion section states that 60.3 % were anti-Jewish, while 13.3% were anti-Muslim.
I urge you to include the most authoritative and widely-accepted definition of antisemitism, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition, or IHRA, which has been adopted by The State Department under President Barack Obama and more than 30 countries. It is the definition referenced in the House of Representatives' Never Again Education Act (H.R. 943), which was co-sponsored by 302 representatives, including 45 from California.
The IHRA definition defines antisemitism -- it does not sanction speech.
Thank you Julie Maltzman
