I grew up understanding first hand what anti-semitism was. In no way does an honest accounting of Palestinian/Zionist history threaten me or my fellow Jews. What does pose a threat to us is the minimization of the white supremacist movement and philosophy as the primary force of antiJewishness in this country and the western world. Equating criticism of Israel for it's anti-Palestinian violence and annexation of sovereign territory does this.
The Arab American section must be moved back into the main body of the ESMC and not regulated to the appendix. The Nakba is a definitive historical moment in our country's history in relation to the Arab and Muslim world, a relationship that has spanned decades and involved direct, extensive intervention. To ignore or minimize this is to engage in the worst kind of historical revisionism.
If we are to deal with the reality of anti-semitism we must do so honestly. A reasonable definition of antisemitism would be "discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jews" or words this effect
I appreciate your attention to this.
Sincerely, Noah Lepawsky
