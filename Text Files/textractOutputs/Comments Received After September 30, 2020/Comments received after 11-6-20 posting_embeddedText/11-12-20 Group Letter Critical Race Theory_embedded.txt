From: on behalf of Sally Nalven Sent: Thursday, November 12, 2020 12:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Critical Race Theory from the ESMC
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am an educator who is deeply concerned about the ESMC.
The ESMC continues to be based on critical race theory, a controversial and divisive ideology that is the wrong way to address the urgent issue of race in our high schools. Critical race theory divides people into oppressor and oppressed groups, creating a hostile and disempowering classroom environment for students. It is polarizing, not uniting. Simply put, we are told to teach students to first label people by the color of their skin, and then condemn white people as being racist.
Critical race theory is in opposition to California State Board of Education's obligation to not adopt instructional materials "that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race." (CA Education Code Section 51501). California teachers must "impress upon the minds of the pupils ...the promotion of harmonious relations" and not promote "discriminatory bias on the basis of race" in our classrooms. (CA Education Code Sections 233.5(a) and 51500).
Last month, Educators for Excellence in Education submitted a request to the IQC to remove critical race theory, explicit and implicit, from the ESMC. This group also submitted a detailed list of all explicit critical race theory references in the September ESMC, including a list of laws, standards, and guidelines related to this request. I ask that you use this as a basis for removing critical race theory from the ESMC and developing a curriculum that will accomplish the ethnic studies goals that we all want to achieve.
Sincerely, Sally Nalven Sally Nalven
