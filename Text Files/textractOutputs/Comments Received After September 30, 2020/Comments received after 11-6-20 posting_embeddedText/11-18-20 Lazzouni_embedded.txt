From: Tehseen Lazzouni Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 3:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum - 11/18/2020
Greetings! My name is Tehseen Usman Lazzouni and I live in San Diego. I'm a product of California public schools, and so are my children, who are Arab-Americans.
I'm calling to ask that the (1) Arab American lesson plan submitted to the CDE by members of the original ESMC advisory committee be re-inserted within Asian American studies where it belongs. I'm also asking that we (2) reject equating criticism of Israel with anti-semitism. We have a responsibility to teach our children about our world and about each other, and that means including Arab American studies. There have been so many stereotypes, prejudices and misinformation about this group. Relegating the Arab American lesson plan to the appendix does a disservice to all California students. It is only through education that ignorance can be overcome and we can have a world where diversity and respect prevail.
Sincerely, Tehseen Lazzouni
