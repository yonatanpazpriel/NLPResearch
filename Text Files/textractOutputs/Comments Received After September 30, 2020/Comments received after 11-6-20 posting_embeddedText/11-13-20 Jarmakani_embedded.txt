Greetings California Educational Officials,
We write to address the omission of Arab American studies lesson plans in the ESMC as submitted.
California has a large community of Arabic speaking citizens from countries of Islamic and Christian faith. These countries straddle the Middle East and North Africa. The Islamic civilization contributed to the world in astronomy, math, and medicine and other important areas. California children of Arabic and Islamic background are frequently exposed to discrimination, abuse, and ridicule which is primarily due to the public ignorance of the Arabic and Islamic culture and the Zionist Israeli lobby that negates any critical view of Israeli violation of human rights with anti-Semitism. This is absurd because THE MIDDLE EAST DESCENDANTS FROM ABRAHAM (Hebrew and Arab) ARE ALL SEMITE.
In light of this and current racial and ethnic unrest, it is shocking that the California Department of Education would choose to negate the Arab studies lesson plan as submitted by the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum advisory committee.
We are requesting that the Arab American original plan be restored within Asian American studies and appreciate your attention to this educational concern.
Jay and Brenda Jarmakani
