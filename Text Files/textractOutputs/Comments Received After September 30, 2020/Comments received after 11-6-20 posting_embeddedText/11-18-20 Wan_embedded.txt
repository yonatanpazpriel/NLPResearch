From: Wan, Alva Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 1:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Written comment to the IQC Commissioners
Hi, my name is Alva Wan. I am a public middle school teacher in San Francisco. As someone who identifies as a Pacific Islander and a Chinese American, I am writing to demand approval of the line edits 384-388 into Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to include the complex and diverse coverage of Pacific Studies.
I am also writing in support of re-inserting Arab American studies (with content on Palestine) within Asian American studies.
Please align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of Ethnic Studies.
If you exclude groups of people, their identities, and their history, your message is that their stories are not necessary and not important. Our ethnic studies model curriculum should include and honor the voices and stories of Pacific islanders and Arab Americans.
