Dear IQC members,
Hello ~ My name is Susie Cover. Yesterday, I attended IQC public hearing via telephone, and I've waited for 3.5 hours to be able to voice my opinion. However, I didn't succeed. Therefore, I am writing to you instead.
I want to express and emphasize just how important it is for ESMC to be included and considered as a part of Curriculum can be adopted in California.
Henceforth I am suggesting the followings:
Please accept the Asian American and Model Minority Lesson to the ESMC as well as to dd four more lesson plans for Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, Indian Americans and Japanese Americans. I would also like to see Chapter 3 revised to highlight the Model Minority Lesson as foundational to the AAPI unit.
Education is power. Learning of different cultures and traditions could only enhance by bringing humanity closer to co-exist in harmony. Also for a minority individuals to blend in the mainstreams of society with an ease.
Sharing and learning about our differences enlighten the orbits of an individual and the networking could be limitless.
ESMC can play a key role in the future and pioneering curriculum for the racial equalities rather than a racial division. It is extremely important not just here in California, but through our US.
ESMC, developmental studies like this, need to continue with a purpose for providing an equality in human race and be a beacon for all the racism to be extinct for good. Very crucial issue!
Thank you.
