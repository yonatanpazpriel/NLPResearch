Instructional Quality Commission of the CDE,
Executing an Ethnic Studies curriculum without Arab-American Studies is dangerous and incredibly degrading to Arab people and youth. Doing so sends a clear message that their socio-historical and socio-cultural experience is invalid.
All educators need to be aware of the youth whose history is continually being marginalized in the education system. Claims of anti-Semitism in response to critical thinking undermines the significance of teachers and students being able to critically analyze violent and oppressive historical and current events. This continues to erase the identity of Arab and Arab-American people at a local, national, and global level.
Relegating Arab-American Studies to the appendix is unacceptable. Excluding ArabAmerican Studies in schools is unacceptable. Depriving students of their culture and identity is unacceptable. We need to align the Ethnic Studies curriculum with necessary anti-colonial and anti-racist ideals.
