To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to you as a registered voter in San Jose who is extremely disappointed in the recent proposed revision to the California Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum which would relegate the Arab-American lesson to an appendix and basically prohibit any honest discussion of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict due to your equating antisemitism with any criticism of Israel. As a Jew who grew up in Baltimore, Maryland in the 1950's when Blacks and Jews were not allowed in certain department stores, amusement parks and recreational facilities, I feel that we should be setting a standard of high ethical and moral values and a commitment to social justice and equality. Furthermore, I think that in the current political climate, we should be sensitive to the alienation of African-American, Arab, Islamic children as well as immigrants from around the world who do not see themselves in our history books, are portrayed negatively, or just flatly ignored. We should be proud that California is considered an "inclusive" and welcoming state and we should do everything to support that positive message .
I urge you to include the Arab American lesson plan submitted by the original advisory committee with the Asian American studies section and revise the definition of anti-semitism to be discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
Thank you for your attention to this very serious matter.
