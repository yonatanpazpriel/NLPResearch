To Instructional Quality Commission: I'm writing as both a Jewish American and a longtime educator in the state of California to add my name to those who support the inclusion of lesson plans about Arab Americans in the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. I deeply believe that providing an education about the history of the many ethnic groups that contribute to our diverse population is key to creating a citizenry that will lead our state forward in a more just manner. The events of this past year have highlighted the need for a more heightened consciousness about racial diversity.
I am particularly concerned about the use of a discredited definition of anti-Semitism that includes criticism of the state of Israel. Israel is a state like any other state; it NEEDS criticism to know when it is committing injustices so that it can change course. I have criticized the government of the United States many times during the course of my lifetime but have never felt anti-American. I would encourage my students and any other students to engage in robust discussions, including criticism of any country, including our own. Likewise, criticism of Israel is NOT the same as anti-Semitism, which should not be tolerated. Anti-Semitism is best defined as "discrimination against, violence towards or stereotypes of Jews".
Please be sure to include lessons on Arab American history in the newest revision of the curriculum, including the reasons that caused their immigration to the United States. This will be a gift to our students and eventually our state and our country.
Respectfully,
Wendy Greenfield
