From: Trusty1 Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 10:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Jimena's Entire Lesson & Not a Link
Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:
I request you include Jimena's entire lesson, and not merely a link. My reason for this is that there is a lot of misunderstanding with respect to the origins and history of Mizrahi & Sephardic Jews in the US, and much of the public doesn't realize they were among the very first settlers in the US, and some were on Christopher Columbus's 3 ships that landed in 1492. I once mentioned this to someone who had some anti-semitic comments, and the person was having trouble believing this, and made comments that suggested she believed Sephardic Jews were an invader. Given the rapid increase in hate crimes it would seem prudent that a proper ethnic studies education should include an actual account of history. And for this reason I am recommending that Jimena's Entire Lesson be included in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum, and not just merely a link to its content.
Thank you for your consideration.
