Re: Revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:
The Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California (JPAC) is the largest single-state coalition of Jewish organizations in the nation. We advocate in Sacramento on behalf of a diverse representation of the California Jewish community, which includes Jewish Federations and Jewish Community Relations Councils, Jewish Family Service agencies, and many other Jewish community organizations that advocate for and directly serve the California Jewish community and the people of California at large. Our member organizations collectively serve over 1,000,000 people each year.
Over the past 18 months, JPAC has worked on behalf of our member organizations with the California Department of Education (CDE) to reiterate our support for teaching Ethnic Studies in California's schools and to help ensure that the state's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum incorporates "core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" for all of California's diverse communities.
JPAC supports the CDE's recommendations for line edits made available to the public on November 6, 2020. We believe that the CDE's recommendations for line edits are both responsible and inclusive, and ensures that the curriculum reflects the diversity of Californians. We therefore encourage the IQC to adopt the CDE's recommendations at the upcoming IQC meeting.
This revision leaves space for JPAC to raise concerns with some of the lessons. Sincerely,

Lynn Bunim Chair, JPAC
