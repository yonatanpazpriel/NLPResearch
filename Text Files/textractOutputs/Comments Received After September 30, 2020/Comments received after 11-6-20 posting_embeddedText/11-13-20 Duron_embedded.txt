Dear IQC Commissioners,
I hope that you and your families are safe during this pandemic.
I am an original striker for Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley in January 1969. Most of you know why Ethnic Studies matters - it is transforming and powerful. We accomplished what we could back then because of our solidarity with students of color and with support of white and Jewish allies. That is why it is so heart-breaking to see what is happening today at the State Department of Education level. You can do something about this.
1. Arab American Studies is an integral component of Ethnic Studies programs in universities throughout California and needs to be recognized as such by the Dept. of Education. Furthermore, to include extremely problematic "perspectives" on racism is setting ES down a path that is of white suprematist and ultra-right zionist doings.
2. This just leads to the great and current danger of the ESMC being whitewashed. From my perspective as an OG TWLF@UCB'69, quoting Emiliano Zapata - "It is better to die on your feet than live on your knees", I'd rather just throw the whole thing out the window. There was a panel of Ethnic Studies experts but California's DOE prefers to override the self-determination of people of color. I'd rather not play their game.
3. Change the ESMC back to its original core values, framework and lesson outlines. If you can accomplish then, then I have another request. The history of the UC Berkeley TWLF strike needs to be documented accurately.
Please do your part in this historic struggle. Take a courageous stand with people of color and our allies.
Si se puede! Yes you can!
In solidarity. Clementina Durï¿½n TWLF@UCB'69
