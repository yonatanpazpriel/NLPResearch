To whom this may concern:
I am writing in support of saving ethnic studies- those of Arab ethnicities and those of Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicities. It is crucial for a progressive development of this country, especially as Californians who are usually the first to progress forward.
Kind regards, Amena M
