From: sab em Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 9:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; Subject: [EXTERNAL] Move Arab American Studies Out of the Appendix!
Hello,
I am frustrated and angry to have heard that after Superintendent Thurmond promised to insert Arab American Studies within the ESMC. Last week, Superintendent Thurmond announced that Arab American Studies has been moved to the appendix. For a year, the Save Arab American Studies (SAAS) Coalition, Arab community, and all who care about ethnic studies have been watching what happens at the state level in regard to not just Arab Studies, but to what's been happening to ethnic studies. Ethnic Studies is anticolonial, anti-racist studies it is not multicultural studies. We should not be all lives matter-ing ethnic studies.
To put my community at the end as if we're an afterthought, as if we're just a comment that doesn't even deserve to be at least highlighted and said is so disrespectful and belittling. I went to Berkeley public schools my whole entire life, and now my siblings will also go to Berkeley public schools their whole entire lives and have the same experiences as me. Let's empower Arab Youth! Our histories, our experiences, our struggles are not an appendix.
Why are we abandoning Arab Youth and Arab Americans in this state because of right wing and zionist pushback? If the CDE, IQC, and Superintendent Thurmond did care about or even understand the principles of Ethnic Studies, you would understand why it's so necessary to even include Arab Studies.
