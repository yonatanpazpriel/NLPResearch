To all who are reviewing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum,
I am an educator taught for 42 years. I am also a parent of a California public school graduate.
I am disturbed to see that, in spite of thousands of emails and petitions, there has been no change in the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC. The problematic Guiding Principles # 4 - 7 grow out of Critical Race Theory, which leads to the highly divisive us vs. them, oppressor vs victim bent of so much in the curriculum. Critical race theory, the Guiding Principles, and the curriculum that stem from them fly in the face of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines, which state that the ESMC must "Encourage cultural understanding of how different groups have ...worked together."
Please change the Guiding Principles # 4-7 and the curriculum so that they do not reflect critical race theory.
I also urge you to adopt the most authoritative and widely-accepted definition of antisemitism, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition (IHRA). This definition was adopted by the US State Department under President Obama and more than 30 countries. It was also referenced in the US House of Representatives's HR 493, the "Never Again Education Act" and was co-sponsored by 303 House representatives, including 45 from California.
Thank you for considering my comments,
