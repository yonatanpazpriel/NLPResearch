From: Katya Rouzina Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 10:52 AM Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for the CDE's recommendations for Ethnic Studies
Hello,
As a resident of California, a Jew, and an immigrant from the former USSR, I'm writing to express my support the California Department of Education (CDE) `s recommendations for the Ethnic Studies Curriculum and urge the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to adopt the proposed changes introduced last week.
I support the inclusion of Sikh-Americans, Armenian-Americans, and other minority communities. I encourage the CDE to meaningfully include and distribute the appendix as an integral part of the model curriculum.
I continue to support the inclusion of the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and continued conversation with mainstream Jewish communal institutions. Mainstream Jewish organizations should be in charge of defining antisemitism. The IHRA definition has been widely adopted by the international Jewish community for its comprehensiveness.
I urge the IQC to reject pressure from fringe anti-Israel groups who are attempting to undo progress regarding these recommendations. Anti-Zionist voices do not represent the Jewish community and are not acting in good faith to stop antisemitism.
Finally, on behalf of other Jews and immigrants, I want to thank Tony Thurmond and the CDE for their hard work. This draft is finally on its way to fulfilling the core call of inclusion and education of AB 2016.
