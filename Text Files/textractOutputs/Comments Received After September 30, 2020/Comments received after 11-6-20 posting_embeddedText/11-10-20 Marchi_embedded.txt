I am writing to request that the issue of Arab American & the Palestine/Israel conflict not be relegated to the appendix in the proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum for all students in our State. It is a disservice to students to not provide views that may vary on this matter and putting the issue in the appendix most likely will lead it to be ignored. I am aware that some in the Jewish community believe that discussing the conflict and criticizing Israeli government policies towards Palestinians is promoting anti-Semitism. This in my view is wrong. The policies of any government can always be questioned but by not discussing them in the context of the current long standing conflict in the Middle East is a disservice to students. Discussing the current ethnic/religious conflicts in our world is critical in helping students see the complexities they will see as they grow into adults. Thank you
