To: State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond; President Linda Darling-Hammond; Members of the State Board of Education; Members and staff of the Instruction Quality Commission at the California Department of Education
I write this letter in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and to follow up with concerns regarding Pacific Islander Studies in the latest draft of the ESMC. I am very pleased with Superintendent Thurmond's and his team's outreach to Pacific Islander educators regarding revisions to the ESMC. However, I would still like to follow-up on the conversations that have been taking place between the CDE and Pacific Islander educators to urge the IQC to do the following:
 Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hauofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam.
 Approve line edits 384, 385, 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion of important PI Studies resources, discussion questions, and distinctions between regions in Oceaniainto the ESMC.
We've worked really hard to bring our communities together to advocate for a Pacific Islander Studies that shows narratives of our communities complexity and diversity. The inclusion of the sources above--which we have worked hard to get permissions for and to make public for the CDE--are truly vital parts of the curriculum and will help educators and students learn about Pacific Islander histories and communities more deeply.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact me at lkava@sfsu.edu to provide further information.
Sincerely,
Leora Kava, PhD Assistant Professor, Critical Pacific Islands & Oceania Studies (CPIOS) College of Ethnic Studies San Francisco State University
