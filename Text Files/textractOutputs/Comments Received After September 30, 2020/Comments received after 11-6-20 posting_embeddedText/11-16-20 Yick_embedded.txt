From: Yick, Julie Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 5:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies model curriculum & Arab American studies
Dear members of the Instructional Quality Commission, Superintendent Thurmond, and Dr. DarlingHammond,
My name is Julie Yick and I am a social studies teacher at Mountain View High School and a doctoral student at San Francisco State University. I have been following the various revisions of the Ethnic Studies model curriculum closely and I am writing to urge you to make the following revisions to the next version of the Ethnic Studies model curriculum:
1) Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place in the curriculum, within Asian American studies, rather than being relegated to the appendix
2) Make sure that there is an ample focus on the diversity within the Asian American community, which includes Pan Asian identity, a robust examination of groups such as Japanese Americans, Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, South Asians, Arab Americans, and other groups
3) Ethnic Studies classes may examine Islamophobia and anti-Semtism. Anti-Semitism is an extremely important issue but needs to be properly defined. A critique of Israeli government policies is not the same as anti-Semitism. Please remove any flawed definitions of anti-Semitism in the model curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration of this input.
