Hi all,
I am writing to you as a young Jewish adult born and raised in California public schools to demand you include Arab American studies, specifically Palestinian narratives, in the Ethnic Studies Model Cirriculum.
Pro-Israel lobby groups do not represent the majority of Jews and they sure as hell don't represent me. Please include Palestinian history and narratives in the main text of the EMSC and edit your definition of antisemitism. Pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemitic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism. Please substitute: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
Best, Ysh Schwartz
