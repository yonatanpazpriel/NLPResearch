Hi,
As someone who has been following IQC and the promised ethnic studies for California students, I was taken aback by the political influence and lobbying to deny California pupils an opportunity to grow up well informed and educated human beings, especially the blatant attempts to deny inclusion a lesson plan on the experience of Arab Americans, especially in light of growing Islamophobia throughout the United States.
I therefore demand to: � Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department
of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee. � Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies. � Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and Liberatore. � Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism.
Thanks Jamal Kanj
