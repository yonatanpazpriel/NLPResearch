From: Matthew Finkelstein Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 10:46 AM To: Stephanie Gregson; Superintendent; Shanine Coats; IQC; Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Stridently Support the CDE's Changes to the ESMC
Please support the California Department of Education (CDE) recommendations and urge the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) to adopt the proposed changes introduced last week.
Please Support the inclusion of Sikh-Americans, Armenian-Americans, and other minority communities and encourage the CDE to meaningfully include and distribute the appendix as an integral part of the model curriculum.
Please support the inclusion of the full IHRA definition of antisemitism and continued conversation with mainstream Jewish communal institutions. Mainstream Jewish organizations should be in charge of defining antisemitism. The IHRA definition has been widely adopted by the international Jewish community for its comprehensiveness.
Please Reject pressure from fringe anti-Israel groups who are attempting to undo progress regarding these recommendations. Anti-Zionist voices do not represent the Jewish community and are not acting in good faith to stop antisemitism. Thank you Tony Thurmond and the CDE for your hard work. This draft is finally on its way to fulfilling the core call of inclusion and education of AB 2016.
