From: Djamal khelif Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 10:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; Cc: [redacted email] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arabic Studies in California Schools
Dear Superintendent, CBE Chair, and IQC Members:
Ahead of your important meeting, I would like to voice my concerns regarding proposals to reduce or nearly eliminate Arabic American Studies from our Schools curriculum. Arab culture has greatly contributed over the centuries to Humanity in many disciplinesranging from medicine, mathematics, physics, astronomy, architecture to literature, sociology and philosophy. Many of the founding principles discovered by the early thinkersof this culture are still in use today in our modern era.
I strongly believe that knowledge is the best promoter of peace and the best antidote to hate and conflicts. Many great cultures contributed to the human progress and madeour world what it is today, each contributing its building block. They should be all acknowledged, celebrated and studied by our kids in school. Downplaying the contributions of any of them will only reinforce ignorance, bias and animosity. This is not thebest way to prepare the new generation especially in the lights of current events pertaining to ethnic inequalities.
I urge you to re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place--within Asian American studies and align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of ethnic studies,which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory
Best regards.
Djamal Khelif
