As a professor of history I am surprised by the notion of equating Zionism with racism.
The study of history should be based on facts and the examination of a movement that help gather Jews who were rejected, persecuted, and burned in ovens in Europe to find a home in their ancient land in Israel. Jewish history has roots in Israel for over 3,000years.
History and social studies should not be based on biases, sheer hate to a certain religion and group of people. The notion of equating Zionism with racism is sheer antisemitism and if it will be adopted as part of the educational program in schools throughoutCalifornia, it will open the door to many antisemite out there that will harm the Jewish community numbering over 1.2 million law abiding citizens in Ca.
Please Help prevent a catastrophe by rejecting pressures from various group who want to instill hate and division among us.
Please reject any form of hate!
Sincerely Gilli Halaby Porter Ranch, Ca.
