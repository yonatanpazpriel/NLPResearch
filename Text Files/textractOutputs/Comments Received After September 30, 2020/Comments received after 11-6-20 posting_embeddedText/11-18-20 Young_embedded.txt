Good afternoon, Commissioners. My name is Andrew Young. I am an American of Asian descent, third generation.
For over two hundred years, people from around the world came to this land of opportunity and country of immigrants to pursue their American Dream. They were eager to become AMERICANS.
I am proud to be just American, without any adjective or hyphen in front of the word American because America is my country and American is my identity. Nothing else.
As an anthropologist by training, I understand the concept of race is a human construct but nothing more. As a staffer at the U.S. Senate under Majority Leaders Robert Byrd and George Mitchell, I understand the value of inclusion and how diversity could be our strength.
If we must label ourselves with an adjective or hyphen, I would then urge the Commissioners to restore the Cambodian American and Model Minority lessons as well as add lessons for Indian, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese Americans.
In order to give equal recognition to all ethnicities in our great Golden State, I would also urge the Commissioners to please add every country of origin from which our 40 million population have immigrated.
The key is all or none. Let's recognize every country of origin or be just Americans.
Commissioners, I am grateful for your service and thank you for your consideration.
Respectfully,
Andrew Young
