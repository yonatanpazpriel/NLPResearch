Dear Members of The Instructional Quality Commission: Across the USA there are growing demands for racial justice. Therefore, it is offensive and
dangerous to exclude Arab American studies from its rightful place--within Asian American studies. The lesson plans for Arab American Studies must align with the guiding principles of ethnic studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory. These studies are important for a better understanding of and by Arab Americans youth, but it is essential for us as a nation which has a long history of being involved aggressively in Arab speaking countries. We want to build a nation based on justice for all peoples, Therefore my request or better said my demand of you is that ethnic studies Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the California Department of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee Having spent some time in Palestine on peace teams, it is extremely important to me that the situation of Palestine be included in this curriculum. Sincerely, Martha Larsen
