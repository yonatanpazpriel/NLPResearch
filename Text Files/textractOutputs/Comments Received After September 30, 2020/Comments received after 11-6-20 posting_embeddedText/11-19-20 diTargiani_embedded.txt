The state of California is the most disappointing state right now, and to fight for something so important is ridiculous.
We deserve to learn and celebrate the Arab American people in our state, history, country, etc. The zionist movement is once again trying to destroy our people and we will not have it.
I am a parent/educator/Palestinian American, and I am not going to stand for such a ridiculous idea to exclude our people because some group wants it out. Stand strong and do what is right. Calling it 'anti-semtic' is a joke. Arabs are SEMITES. zionists want to call jews only semites. That is not true- once again, trying to change history to meet their racist agenda.
DO NOT LET THAT HAPPEN,
