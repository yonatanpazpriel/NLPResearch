What are ya'll up to? This is crazy. Arab American Studies is CENTRAL to ethnic studies. You cannot have ethnic studies without Arab American Studies you cannot have ethnic studies without Edward Said. What in the hell and why?
Include Arab American Studies in Asian American studies which is where they BELONG.
Align with the guiding principles of Ethnic Studies it is a legitimate discipline!
Reject definitions of inaccurate definitions of AntiSemitism! Sharing Palestinian stories is not antisemitism.
