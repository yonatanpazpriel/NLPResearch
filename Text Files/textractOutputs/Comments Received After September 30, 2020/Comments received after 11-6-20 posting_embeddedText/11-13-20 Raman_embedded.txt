Hello, I'm writing this statement in support of the Arab-American and Pacific Islander studies and their proposed curriculum. I'm emphasizing the following demands:
� align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of Ethnic Studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial, and liberatory
� Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place within Asian American studies � Include the Arab American lesson plan-inclusive of content on Palestine- submitted to the
California Department of Education by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) advisory committee. � Reject debunked definitions of antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism � Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific alongside critiques of power and systems of oppression seen in the work of Epeli Hau'ofa, Lisa Kahaleole Hall, and Kerri Ann Borja's UN Testimony on the Question of Guam. � Approve line edits 384, 385, 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion of important PI Studies resources, discussion questions, and distinctions between regions in Oceania into the ESMC
Superintendent Thurmond is advocating for changes that will lower the educational quality and value of Ethnic Studies. The demands listed above will ensure a well-rounded and analytical education for students. In my personal experience, classes I've taken that have met similar demands have completely changed my thinking for the better, and have encouraged me to learn different (and valuable) perspectives. I truly think these changes to the curriculum will be revolutionary in terms of improving humanity! Thank you for your time, Isabella Raman Undergraduate Psychology Student California State Polytechnic University, Pomona
