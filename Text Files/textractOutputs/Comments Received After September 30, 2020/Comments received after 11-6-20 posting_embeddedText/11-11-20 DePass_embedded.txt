Dear Instructional Quality Commission,
I am a resident of California and a major taxpayer since 1984. I have the following comments on the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum,
� Pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemitic are self-serving and absolutely unacceptable. They are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism.
� Please substitute: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
� We know from the demands for racial justice sweeping this country, that it is offensive and dangerous to shunt the histories and perspectives of any group of people, including the Palestinian people, to the sidelines. These revisions are tone-deaf to the political moment we are living in.
� Our children are once again being left to fend for themselves in an increasingly racialized and polarized political climate. California should be a sanctuary, not a place of danger for our students and their families.
� Young people in particular face the consequences of anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian racism. Arab youth are targeted in a way that Jewish youth are not, notwithstanding the constant complaints that we hear about antisemitism.
� For too long, Arab youth have learned little about their history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education
Thank you for considering these important and valid points!
