From: Jerome Fishkin Sent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020 4:00 PM To: IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Re: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 11/18 - Subcommittee Agenda Item 8 11/19 - Full Commission Agenda item 9 I support the inclusion of Anti-Semitism as part of the Model Curriculum Alas, anti-Semitic incidents continue to occur in California; Remember the shooting at Chabad of Poway in April 2019. Or the vandalismat Nessah Synagogue in Beveraly Hills in December 2019. Or the continuing stream of anti Semitic incidents this year at Redwood High School in Larkspur. Anti-Semitism should not be relegated to a link; it should be part of the main curriculum. Jerry Fishkin, retired, Walnut Creek CA
