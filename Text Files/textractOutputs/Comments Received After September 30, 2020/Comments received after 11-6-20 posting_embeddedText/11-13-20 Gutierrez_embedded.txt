From: Andrew Paul Gutierrez Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 10:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American studies
Dear The Instructional Quality Commission of the California Department of Education members.
The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is a travesty of moral and intellectual judgements. You should recall that science and philosophy were saved during the dark ages in Europe by Arab and Jewish scholars in Spain. You should also note that the well funded Zionist lobby of the APARTHEID State of Israel has sought since 1948 to wipe Palestine and Palestinian history from global consciousness, and your actions in subverting Arab American studies and any mention of Palestine from the curriculum is intellectually dishonest. Further, to conflate criticism of Israel's brutal occupation policies with anti Semitism is to throw common sense under the bus -- in a word shear dishonest stupidity.
I have worked with Israeli colleagues since 1978, and I have seen the brutal oppression of Palestinians first hand. To help in the suppression of Palestinian aspirations for freedon and dignity by erasing their history makes you culpable in Israel's oppression. Please accept my apologies for my forthright analysis of the task you have before you. I pray you will act ethically. Kind regards, Andrew --
