I urge you to not adopt the IHBA definition of anti-Semitism or anything like it. It confounds criticism of Israel with anti-Semitism. I am Jewish and criticize Israel's treatment of Palestinians and I am definitely not anti-Semitic. I fear that you are bowing to supporters of Israel including those who claim that Israel can do no harm. It is not singling Israel out to criticize it � we do that freely when individual citizens criticize other governments. It is not to delegitimize Israel to criticize it. What happened to free speech? Anti- Semitism is discrimination against Jews for being Jewish. That is not hard to understand � it has nothing to do with criticizing Israel. Here is a reasonable definition to include
"Anti-Semitism is discrimination against, violence toward, and stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish."
