From: Amina Idoui Sent: Tuesday, November 10, 2020 7:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; Superintendent <Superintendent@cde.ca.gov>; lindadh@suse.standford.edu Cc: info@aroc.org Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment for Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern:
I was deeply saddened and upset by the news that the Ethnic Studies curriculum relegated Arab American Studies to the appendix of the lesson plan. This practical erasure of the identity and history of the quarter of a million Arab Americans in CA is offensive to say the least. I remember my own experiences as a student, with internalized oppression, thinking Arabs were sand terrorists. I was ashamed that my mother donned a headscarf. These experiences negatively impacted me, particularly after 9/11. I beg of you to consider the impact this will have on future students and ensure people are properly educated and understanding. A multicultural education should be a hallmark moving forward, and Arabs should be a key part of that. Palestine and others deserve to have their history and perspective displayed. I truly hope you show a true commitment to diversity and inclusion and justly represent Arabs and Palestinians in the ethnic studies curriculum.
Sincerely,
Amina Idoui
