From: Sami Lamont Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2020 11:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American Studies, agenda item 8.A.4
Dear IQC, As an upcoming teacher, I know that I want to prepare students to understand themselves, the world they live in, and feel empowered to make change. Relegating Arab American Studies to the appendix not only erases students with Arab backgrounds from the curriculum, it strips other students from truly understanding Arab American issues in all of their complexity. The stereotypes present in the current curriculum fly in the face of the goals of ethic studies, leading to the perpetuation of the status quo rather than challenging it. The power of ethnic studies lies in empowerment to resist oppression and the IQC revisions sap ethnic studies of this power. I wholeheartedly support the following demands of the Save Arab American Studies Coalition:
1. Include the Arab American lesson plan submitted to the IQC by members of the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) Advisory Committee.
2. Re-insert Arab American Studies in its rightful place--within Asian American Studies. 3. Honor the field of Ethnic Studies. Align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of Ethnic
Studies, which are anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory.
Sincerely, Samantha Lamont UC Berkeley Teacher Candidate
