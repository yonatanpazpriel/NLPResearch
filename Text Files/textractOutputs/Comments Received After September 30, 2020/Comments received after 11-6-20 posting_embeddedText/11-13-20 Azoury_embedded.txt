From: Leanna Azoury Sent: Friday, November 13, 2020 4:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; [emails redacted] Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please keep Arab American studies part of the ethnic studies curriculum
Hello,
My understanding is that there is a proposal to limit the curriculum on Arab American studies to an appendix, and I'm writing to express my opinion that it must be its own section within the broader Asian American studies.
Please also consider the importance of teaching about the history of Palestine and the distinction between anti-semitism and criticism of the state of Israel.
There are deleterious effects on the mental health of Arab-American youth resulting from a lack of education and awareness of their history. They are often subject to racist bullying based on offensive stereotypes, and I implore you to consider these effects when designing the ethnic studies curriculum.
Sincerely, Leanna
