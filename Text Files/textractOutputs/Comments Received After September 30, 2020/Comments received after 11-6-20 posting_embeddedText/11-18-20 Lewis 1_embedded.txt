Public Comment
I am an American History Major at the University California Berkeley and I support the original September 2020 guiding principles. As a Black Student who grew up in Fresno, CA, I never had the opportunity to learn about the innovators of the black community as highlighted in the current Afro-Futurism lesson plan. While I support the lessons for the Black community, I am seeing blatant erasure of the other half of the African American experience in the United States. Issues like redlining, Jim Crow laws, school segregation, and police brutality are essential for students to know in order to understand the world that these innovators fought and succeeded in. Many have called for lessons that will inspire students and this along with the current proposed lessons will inspire black children to rise above their hardships like these people did. I have heard the phrase "marxist revolutionary agenda" to describe my ancestors experience in the most demeaning way. I urge that these principles, while hard to talk about, are included in the model curriculum.
