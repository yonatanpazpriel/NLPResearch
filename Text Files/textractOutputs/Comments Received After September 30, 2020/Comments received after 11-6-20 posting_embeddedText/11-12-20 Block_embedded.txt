From: Diana Block Sent: Wednesday, November 11, 2020 10:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov>; Superintendent; [email redacted] Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place!
Hello, I am deeply disturbed by the duplicitous shift that is being made in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I cannot understand how you can succumb to pressure that would relegate Arab American studies to an appendix! This is so insulting and dismissive of the importance of the Arab American experience for California students.
I urge you to uphold your commitment to including the Arab American lesson plan that was submitted to the California Department of Education by members of the original ESMC advisory committee. I also ask that you re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place - within Asian American studies.
Finally, as a member of Jewish Voice for Peace I emphatically ask that you reject a bogus definition that equates criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Using such a definition undermines the right of teachers, students and community members to engage in critical thinking and discussion.
I truly hope that you will respond affirmatively to these requests.
Sincerely, Diana Block San Francisco
