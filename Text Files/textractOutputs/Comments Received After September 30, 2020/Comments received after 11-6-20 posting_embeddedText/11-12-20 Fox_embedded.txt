To Whom it May Concern, I am demanding that the Arab American studies be incorporated into the CORE curriculums of ethnic studies rather than being cast aside as inferior. As a student who has taken multiple history classes in the United States for 11 years I have never learned about Arab American studies. This is unacceptable and I demand that this changes for the well-being of the education system in California.
The fact that this is up for debate is unacceptable, rude, and ignorant. It says a lot about our California Board of education.
