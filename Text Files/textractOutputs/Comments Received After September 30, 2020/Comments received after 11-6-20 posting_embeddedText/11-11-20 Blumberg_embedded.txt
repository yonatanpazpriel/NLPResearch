To Whom It May Concern,
As a Jewish person educated in California public schools, I'm angered and saddened that the Dept. of Ed has caved to Pro-Israel interest groups in changing the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Antisemitism is real, but critiques of Israel are not antisemitic, and saying so harms all Jewish people and their allies across the world. Please use the definition of antisemitism held up internationally by many Jewish people: antisemitism is discrimination against, violence towards, or stereotypes of Jews for being Jewish.
Our communities are stronger when we stand together in the face of anti-black racism and discrimination of all types. These proposed changes would harm Arab and Muslim youth at a time when hate crimes are on the rise, and would harm teachers who want to do their very best to protect all of their students. We need a truthful telling of the ways in which white supremacy, colonialism, and islamophobia have harmed us, not a Zionist apologist history.
I urge you to reconsider the proposal and listen to Arab and Muslim students.
Thank you, Lucy Blumberg
