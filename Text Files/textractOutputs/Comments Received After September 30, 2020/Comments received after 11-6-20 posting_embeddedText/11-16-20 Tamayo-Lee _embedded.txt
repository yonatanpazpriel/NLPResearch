Dear parties of concern,
I'm writing as a 3rd generation Filipnx/Chinese American student of life and resident of CA.
Please align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of Ethnic studies. Re-insert Arab American studies in its rightful place within Asian American Studies. Include Arab American lesson plans inclusive of content on Palestine. Reject debunked definitionsof antisemitism that equate criticism of Israel with antisemitism. Ensure the Pacific Islander Studies content includes coverage of the complexity and diversity of the Pacific. Approve line edits 384, 385, 386, 387, and 388, which delineate the inclusion ofimportant PE Studies resources, discussion questions, and distinctions between regions in Oceania in ESMC.
Thank you!
Celi Tamayo-Lee
