Jews are European colonial settlers in the land of Israel and must be driven out "by any means necessary." This is what Dr. Rabab Abdulhadi director of the Department of Arab and Muslim Ethnicities teaches at SFSU and beyond. Palestinians are the indigenous people whose land was stolen from them by these Jews who have no legitimate claim to the land. It is imperative to counter this claim with the facts of the 3,000 year history of Jews in the land of Israel and the greater Middle East and North Africa,. That is why I am asking you to participate in the effort to include the JIMENA lessons in the proposed California Ethnic Studies curriculum. All the information on how to do this is included in this email. ----- Forwarded Message ----From: JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa To: "[email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, November 17, 2020, 12:18:56 PM PST Subject: An Open Call to Action from California's Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews
Urgent Call to Action on California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Our work is not done!

Thanks to you, in September 10,000 people asked the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) of California's State Board of Education to include JIMENA's lesson "Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern Americans." As the FBI just released alarming new statistics that antisemitic hate crimes rose 14% in 2019, accounting for almost all religiously motivated bias crimes in the USA, JIMENA's work to ensure that antisemitism is integrated into California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum framework has become increasingly urgent and critical.
This Wednesday and Thursday -- November 18 & 19 -- the IQC will decide which lessons to include in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. With eleven new ethnic groups submitting 300 new pages, the IQC will have hard choices to make -- which lessons to include in full, which to link to, and even which to reject.
Students, educators, parents, and concerned citizens please call the IQC and urge the commissioners to include JIMENA's entire lesson, not a link, in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
All can speak out!

Talking Points � Callers will have one minute to speak.
Start off with a very short personal experience. For example, Mizrahi or Sephardic Jews can briefly describe their personal history and experiences of racialization, discrimination, and antisemitism IN THE UNITED STATES.
� In September 10,000 people wrote in and asked commissioners to include the "Antisemitism and Middle Eastern Jewish Americans" lesson in the Model Curriculum.
� California's State Board of Education's rules require the state's curricula to portray peoples proportionately and not discriminate in favor of or against nationalities, races, ethnicities, and religions. Therefore Middle Eastern Jewish Americans and Arab Americans should be treated equally and placed in the curriculum's Asian American Section. � Chapter 3 of the curriculum you approved in August is clear: "Asian Americans includes the unique experiences of ...Middle Easterners."

� I support adding the "Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews" lesson because it addresses antisemitism. Antisemitism continues to be the 3rd most prevalent ethnic-based and the most prevalent religious-based hate crime in California according to government statistics, up a disturbing 72% since 2016. � Ethnic Studies includes the study of "forms of bigotry including antisemitism" according to the Preface of the model curriculum draft you approved in August. � Included in this lesson is an accurate definition of antisemitism, the one most widely used around the world by Jewish rights organizations and both the US Democratic (Obama administration) and Republican administrations' State Departments.
� Include the Middle Eastern American lessons in full so they won't be overlooked. Do not share them via a link to a webpage.
� Superintendent Thurmond shared his hopes for this curriculum in his November 6 press conference: "as we talk about the rise of white supremacy, we must talk about the increase in hate acts and bigotry against the Jewish community, the high level of antiSemitism that we see."

JIMENA's mission is to achieve universal recognition of the heritage and history of the one million indigenous Jewish refugees from the Middle East and North Africa and their
descendants. Our programs aim to ensure that the accurate history of Mizrahi and

Sephardic Jews is incorporated into mainstream Jewish and Middle Eastern narratives in order to create balance in attitudes, narratives, discourse, and negotiations about Middle Eastern refugees and the modern Jewish experience.
