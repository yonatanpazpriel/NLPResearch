From: Murphy, Vickere Sent: Friday, November 20, 2020 4:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] From the Office of Senator Anthony J. Portantino
Hi, I am hoping you can help me regarding the status of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Senator Portantino has received messages from constituents regarding reports that Arab American Studies may be cut from the model curriculum. We have also received messages from constituents about the representation of the American Jewish experience in the history curriculum.
I know the process has continued over the summer and I wanted to check with you to find out what the current status of the model curriculum is, particularly with respect to the Jewish American experience and with Arab American studies.
Many thanks in advance,
Vickere Murphy, Senior District Representative Office of Senator Anthony J. Portantino, 25th District
