3) Hi, my name is Rachel Rovinsky, and I am a CA voter, UC Berkeley student, and member of Education Reimagined in the Bay. I have concerns regarding how much Jewish studies is being centered in the previously submitted public comments for this meeting. I would like to remind the Department of Education that "At its core, the field of ethnic studies is the interdisciplinary study of race, ethnicity, and indigeneity, with an emphasis on the experiences of people of color in the United States." To bring religion into ethnic studies, especially without an intersectional lens, only shifts focus away from the core of ethnic studies, and I would urge the Department to question why most of the push for Jewish studies to be included in the curriculum does not come from Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian, and Arab Jews. There are other school subjects, like history, that already focus on religion, and those subjects can do a much better job teaching about world religions and antisemitism with inputs from the Jewish communities of color I mentioned previously. That is an important concern for the subject of history and religious studies, not ethnic studies. I urge you to center Black and Indigenous stories and resistance in California's ethnic studies curriculum, thank you.
