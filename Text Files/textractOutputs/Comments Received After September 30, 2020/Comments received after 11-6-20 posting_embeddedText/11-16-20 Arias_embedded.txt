From: Simone Arias Sent: Monday, November 16, 2020 12:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
As a retired Social Studies and English teacher, I am grateful for legislation that addresses the biases in education. Having taught more than 60 diverse populations across San Diego, I was inspired to get a PhDin Global Education to better prepare myself to teach with credibility and inclusiveness. I focused on African, Latin American, and Middle Eastern Studies to expand my perspectives.
While I welcome serious discussions about improving curriculum and mandating a course in Ethnic Studies, the divisive approach being proposed privileges certain ethnicities and undermines the intent of valuing allstudents. Political concerns dominate current discussion and fail to acknowledge that teachers are committed to curriculum that reflects multiple perspectives on historical topics without imposing personal views. That does not seem to be the direction thecurriculum is headed. More inquiry and discussion is needed so that schools do not continue to marginalize populations out of prejudice or ignorance. It is harmful to students whose histories and experience are misrepresented and ironically perpetuates theproblems Ethnic Studies is attempting to address.
Some progress has been made in selected fields of African, Latino, and East Asian history but Jewish, Muslim, and other ethnicities are often not given the same serious and comprehensive consideration. More discussionis needed to avoid privileging and denigrating populations intentionally or not.
Thank you,
