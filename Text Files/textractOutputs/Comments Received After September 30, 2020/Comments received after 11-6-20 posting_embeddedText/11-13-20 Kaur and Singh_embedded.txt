Dear Superintendent Thurmond, CDE officials, IQC and SBE,
We would like to recognize your support in listening to the groundswell of urgent calls from the Sikh community for meaningful and accurate representation in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
As the two leading Sikh organizations dedicated to ensure that Sikh contributions are finally seen in our California public education system, we are appreciative that the CDE has taken the necessary steps to propose some form of meaningful and accurate representation of Sikh Americans in California. This includes the commitment to taking our suggestions and line edits which were made during the March 2020 public comment period and including our Sikh lesson plan, which was submitted as a resource in the Appendix alongside other communities.
These are positive developments that demonstrate the importance of Sikh inclusion in this process. However, we are calling for the Sikh American lesson plan (and any additional lesson plans from Asian communities that are currently in the proposed Appendix) to be included in the Asian American unit. Given that the majority of the Sikh population in California is South Asian, the optimal fit for this content remains in the Asian American unit as one of the four main Ethnic Studies categories.
Thank you for taking feedback from the California Sikh community and remaining responsive to addressing the feedback that comes from other experts representing other marginalized communities in California. We remain committed to working with the CDE, IQC and SBE to ensure a rigorous ESMC.
Yours sincerely,
Satjeet Kaur Executive Director The Sikh Coalition
Naindeep Singh Executive Director The Jakara Movement
