Educators for Excellence in Ethnic Studies
11-12-2020 NOTE:  T he CDE did not r eference our August and October public comments in the IQC's
November 18-19 Meeting agenda packet and has n ot issued a recommendation on these requests:
 In August we advised that "setting up a curriculum based on critical race theory, which states that 'racial inequality emerges from the ... differences that white people create ...to maintain elite white interests' (is) setting up a classroom...with a 'versus' model (that) is pedagogically inappropriate and designed to polarize." https://cde.app.box.com/s/1rqat6lkrgyrvw1vcrb8a358ihktquuf/file/705246339226
 In October, we submitted the following cover letter and comments.
October 29, 2020
VIA EMAIL Members of the Instructional Quality Commission Governor Gavin Newsom State Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond The Honorable Tony Thurmond Dr. Stephanie Gregson Shanine Coats
Dear California Officials,
As educators, we support ethnic studies courses that confront racism, develop civic responsibility, and help students develop the 21st century skills that t hey n eed to succeed in school, work, and life.
Woven throughout the C alifornia Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) are direct and indirect references to "critical race theory," which the ESMC states is a key theoretical framework and pedagogy for ethnic studies instruction (ESMC Chapter 3).
Critical race theory is not sound K-12 classroom pedagogy. It divides people into oppressor and oppressed groups, creating a hostile and disempowering classroom environment for students. It is polarizing, not uniting, and makes group identity primary at the expense of individual achievement. S imply put, we are told to teach students to first label people by the color of their skin, and then condemn white people as being racist.
Critical race theory is in opposition to California State Board of Education's obligation to not adopt instructional materials "t hat contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of r ace." (CA Education Code Section 51501). C alifornia teachers must "i mpress upon the minds of the pupils ...the promotion of harmonious relations" and not p romote "discriminatory bias on the basis of r ace" in our classrooms. (C A Education Code Sections 233.5(a) and 51500).
As Stanford University Graduate School of Education Professor and Ethnic Studies researcher Thomas Dee states, "high quality ethnic studies model curricula...stress the considerable cultural assets and capacity of historically marginalized people to achieve well." ( KQED interview, August 2019, minutes 3 and 22).
Please r emove all critical race theory references and race-based pejoratives from the ESMC. See below for our detailed comments.

Critical Race Theory Critical race theory is the theory that race "is a socially constructed concept that is used by white people to further their economic and political interests at the expense of people of colour [and so w hites] create the circumstances that give rise to poverty and criminality in many minority communities.... steeped in radical black thought and nationalist thinking."1
