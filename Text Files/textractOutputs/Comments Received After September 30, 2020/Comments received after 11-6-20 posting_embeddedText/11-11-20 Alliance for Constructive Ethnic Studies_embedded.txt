Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
We recognize the immense value of a balanced, thoughtful and inspirational Ethnic Studies Curriculum, and are concerned that the thousands of letters which were submitted to you, asking that the Guiding Principles be changed, were not reflected in the categories of responses that were published as Attachment A, Summary Table of Public Comments dated 2020-11-6.
Please write in a category on your copy of the Summary Table of Public Comments to reflect the more than 5,000 emails expressing concern about the current, narrow ideological approach of the ESMC, as reflected in the Guiding Values and Principles. (These emails and group letters about the Guiding Principles from Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies, and many others, are mentioned in The Detailed Table of Public Comment & Review 2020-11-6)
Please also keep this large category of requests in mind as you consider what to do with the suggested line edits about the Guiding Values and Principles, #48 � 51 in the Table of Submitted Line Edits. We, and the thousands who submitted comments, believe that the best change would be to replace The Guiding Values and Principles (Ch. 1 p. 8-9, lines 173 � 199) with Carlos Cort�s' Ethnic Studies Principles and Outcomes, (currently included in the ESMC, and named The Eight Outcomes of K-12 Ethnic Studies Teaching (Ch. 1, p. 9-14, lines 200 � 336). They are as follows:
(1) Pursuit of justice and equity (2) Working toward greater inclusivity (3) Furthering self-understanding (4) Developing a better understanding of others (5) Recognizing intersectionality (6) Promoting self-empowerment for civic engagement (7) Supporting a community focus (8) Developing interpersonal communication
While the above recommendation is the best solution, there are other possible options to ensure a more balanced, accurate, and empowering curriculum, such as replacing specific words which promote a narrow political agenda in the existing Guiding Values and Principles. Teachers can't encourage the desired open inquiry of California's History � Social

Thank you for seeing that our comments are properly noted during your IQC review, and thank you for your efforts to create an excellent Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for California students and teachers.
