Please include in your ethnics studies,
Swedish, Finnish, Dutch, European native Ethnic Studies pre 1900, prior to Bolshevik interference.
Leaving Europeans out of the cirruculeum is RACIST, UNINTELLECTUAL and deliberately politically driven.

Please, call me anytime to discuss not including Europe's fine characteristics as you do other ethnic groups. This is a Racist Policy.
