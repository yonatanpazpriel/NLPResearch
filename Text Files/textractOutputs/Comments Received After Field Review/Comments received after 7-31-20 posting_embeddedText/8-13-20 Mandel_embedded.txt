To Whom It May Concern,
My name is Sandy Mandel and I am a resident of San Diego. I am a retired high school French and Spanish teacher with 35 years of experience.
My entire professional life has been working to give students an appreciation of different languages and cultures so I am thrilled by a California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I do fear, however, that all of the " approved" courses have not been carefully scrutinized.
Some of the courses are deeply troubling; for example, "The Philosophy of the Nation of Islam." This group has been identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as deeply racist, anti-Semitic and anti-gay. We should be encouraging courses that seek to improve racial and religious relations. Teaching the philosophy of one of the highest-ranking hate groups in the US does not accomplish this goal. Furthermore, discussing this belief system can only make students feel uncomfortable, victimized and unsafe in their classrooms.
The Nation of Islam philosophy has been consistently and fervidly rejected by mainstream Muslims, Martin Luther King and eventually even Malcom X.
A philosophy that believes that Catholics, the LGBT community and Caucasians are sub-humans who have not yet evolved does not belong anywhere in our schools.
We need to rework the guiding principles to be sure that rather than foment hatred and divisiveness we offer courses and lessons with the goal of building respect, understanding and healing.
Respectfully,
