Dear Members of the California Department of Education, Mr. Thurmond, and Ms. DarlingHammond,
As a resident of California and community member it is with great concern that I contact you today to strongly voice my opinion for the need to include Arab America Studies in the California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I ask that the original committee of writers and experts reconvene to revise the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). These scholars and teachers are after all, the experts on Ethnic Studies as a field of study and know intimately the importance of having a curriculum and pedagogy that includes Arab Americans. I ask that an ESMC is passed to include Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines and includes Palestine in Arab American studies. Such curriculum materials are to meet the needs of California students and communities, and to maintain the original Ethnic Studies framework that has played a very important part in bringing our communities forward in strength and knowledge. We all benefit from an informed community with disciplinary knowledge, language, and pedagogy. We all benefit from school studies that build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other. Thank you very much in advance for your consideration. Sincerely, Paula Rainey
