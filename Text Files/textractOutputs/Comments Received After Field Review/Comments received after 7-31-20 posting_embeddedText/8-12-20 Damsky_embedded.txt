From: Andrea Beth Damsky Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 8:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Subject:IQC Meeting - Agenda Item 2
Dear Esteemed IQC Commissioners,
My name is Andrea Beth Damsky, and I live in La Mesa, California. I want to thank the California Department of Education for their work in revising the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum this year. The new draft has made many significant improvements over last year's initial draft.
I have some concerns, however. When the primary reference of Jews in the revised Ethnic Studies curriculum is in the context of our communities benefiting from white privilege, I fear this could coincide with and the dangerous antisemitic trope that, "Jews Have Too Much Power." Further, the curriculum fails to mention the Middle Eastern Jewish communities in our state; I fear this erasure could contribute to the disinformation that all Jews are white. Finally, this framing ignores the experiences of European Jews who continue to be impacted personally and communally by violent white supremacy, genocide, and acts of antisemitism.
I encourage you to incorporate more robust instructional material on antisemitism. Some excellent source materials such as Eric K. Ward, Yad Vashem: The World Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, JIMENA, and the ADL are all credible resources to address these shortcomings in any revisions.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, Andrea Beth Damsky La Mesa, CA
