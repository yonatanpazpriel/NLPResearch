My name is Joshua Washington, I am an African American educator from California, and I am unhappy with the current draft of ethnic studies curriculum. It continues to represent our Black people as an extreme left wing monolith, ignoring the diversity of our voices and experiences. Who students see in the curriculum is important. Here, students see victims, rising up against others, often with violence. They don't see many role models whose accomplishments fall outside a narrow political ideology. We want a curriculum that presents our history and all history honestly
Since Arab Americans are included, their story should be accurate too. It must include the long history of imperialism and oppression by Arabs against Blacks throughout Africa. Include Arabs' current brutal role in Sudan, their bombings in Nigeria, and their ownership of Black slaves in Mauritania. While we will not tolerate any form of discrimination or Islamophobia, it also is wrong to categorize oppressors only as victims. Ethnic Studies should not be revisionist history, erasing certain sins and fabricating others.
