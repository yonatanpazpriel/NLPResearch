From: Jill Kulick Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 2:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Senator.Hill@senate.ca.gov; assemblymember.Mullin@assembly.ca.gov Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC - Concerns
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I am pleased to read about some of the improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). In light of our current political state, I would like to have you review and improve upon the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my suggestions: Add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development Remove any reference which encourages a positive belief about BDS and anti -Israel narratives Require that diverse viewpoints are respected Review references to Jews that are misleading and offensive
For many of us who have been the target of bigotry and anti-Semitism, this curriculum is extremely important. Please continue to make significant revisions to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you, Jill Kulick San Carlos , CA
