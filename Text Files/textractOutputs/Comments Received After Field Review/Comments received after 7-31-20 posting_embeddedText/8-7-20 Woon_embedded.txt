Dear IQC Board members,
I support the ESMC, including Arab American studies.
It's important that students are educated with accurate facts about the Arab American community and history, so that their knowledge isn't from biased pundits and "fake news". Especially given the current climate, they need an anti-racist education to be able to thrive and focus on what's really important: fairness, truth, inclusion, and advancing society into a just and sustainable future.
Also, Ethnic Studies has been correlated with greater positive outcomes for students, personally, academically, and socially.
Thank you,
Ang Woon
