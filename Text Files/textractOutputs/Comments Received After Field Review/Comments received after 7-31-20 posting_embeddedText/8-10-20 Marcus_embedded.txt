Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, As a Jewish citizen of California, a parent and a grandparent, I am glad for some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC): -- Removal of explicitly antisemitic slurs from the ESMC (though anti-Zionist references remain in footnotes, links, and bibliography) -- Addition of guidance for teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints -- Inclusion of an identity unit in the instructional guidelines. However, I am very upset by the flaws in the proposed second draft of the ESMC. Here are my major concerns: -- the misrepresentation of Jews and other ethnic groups -- the impassion of a one-sided political ideology --- the same problematic principles and ideological framework from which all lessons are developed -- EMSC sections are drawn from the book Education at War, which effectively encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives -- As an example, the BLM lesson in the African American section lists the following as a primary resource: https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/summer-2017/bringing-black-lives-matter-into-theclassroom-part-ii . In it, Palestine is equated with South Africa and Stonewall. This is the same article that describes non-violent civil rights leaders as "passive" and "docile" and condemns considering them to be "heroes." -- If I had had to raise my own children under this ESMC, I would have been appalled at the bias and negativity shown.
I request that you make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles. Thank you, Sincerely,
