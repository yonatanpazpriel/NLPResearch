From: Richard Keller Sent: Saturday, August 1, 2020 11:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of including Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the IQC:
As a resident of Oakland, CA, I am writing to ask you to please keep the ethnic studies model curriculum intact with Arab American Studies within the rubric of Asian American studies. Any revisions of the Arab American studies curriculum should be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. Arab American studies including the history and current struggles in Palestine must be included.
As a member of Jewish Voice for Peace I know how very important it is that we educate our youth to help fight islamophobia and gain an understanding of Palestinian Americans' experience. As a German-American, I know what happens when an ethnic or religious minority is demonized and marginalized by state-supported actors. This must not happen in our country.
Thank you,
