My name is Kian Mirshokri, I just graduated from Palisades Charter High School and I am a first-generation American. 70 years ago, my grandfather immigrated to Iran, fleeing the persecution they faced as Jews in Iraq. 34 years later, my parents immigrated to America, fleeing the persecution they faced as Jews in Iran. I support the values of ethnic studies. I want my peers to learn about ethnic minority communities across this state, including my own. Even with the recent changes to the curriculum that took out antisemitic rhetoric and created a more inclusive curriculum, problems still remain. In chapter 3 of the curriculum, there is a line which states "the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners". It saddens me that diverse and rich populations from the middle east are lumped together. This is a list of middle eastern communities who are neglected by name and should be represented in the curriculum: Mizrahi Jews Kurds Iranians Assyrian-Christian Coptic-Christians Yezidis Baha'is Zoroastrians Additionally, in chapter 3 of the curriculum, there are references to American Jews which don't fully represent Jews in California, The ESMC neglects the stories of Jews of color and Jewish people who have immigrated to America from all over the world, including from Central and South America, the former Soviet Union, and the Middle East like my family. I hope you will revise the ESMC further to represent students like me within Asian American studies and in references to the Jewish community.
