From: Victoria-Kaytlan Filimoehala-Egan Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pacific Islander's in K-12
To whom this may concern,
My name is Victoria-Kaytlan Filimoehala-Egan; I am a Tongan-American and a recent graduate of the University of Hawai'i at Manoa with a dual Bachelors in Sociology and Ethnic Studies.
In the past few days I have learned that the California Department of Education is now in the process of developing an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It is vital to the education of all students K-12 to learn about the history of the Pacific Islands and the impact of the United States and just how much of the history intertwined. From the testing of the Bikini Atoll in the 1940's to the over through of the Kingdom of Hawai'i.
Also considering the Large number of Pacific Islanders that live within California alone this needs to be taken into deep consideration and put in the schools curriculum. As an Ethnic Studies major this in my opinion is necessary Pacific Island students have been looked passed throughout history and deserve to be in these books. Please take this into consideration these children deserve representation that's what Ethnic Studies is all about.
Best, Victoria-Kaytlan Filimoehala-Egan
