From: Carol Blitzer Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 1:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC ongoing concerns
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I was pleased to note some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) � mainly
removal of antisemitic slurs and addition of guidance for teachers on dealing with competing sources of information. However, I am still very concerned by the latest ESMC draft.
My major concerns are: * The ESMC guiding values and principles do not reflect California's shared values and advocate a narrow political philosophy; * The second draft still includes politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from the first draft; * The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive; need for adding a definition of antisemitism that addresses stereotyping and double standards against Jews.
I grew up in Southern California (in the city of Bell), one of three Jewish families in the community. I was chased down the street with a bigger kid yelling "You killed Christ." I fully understand what it's like to be a minority in an ill-educated town � and how important that we get our curriculum to reflect our cultural and racial diversity.
I therefore ask you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles. Thank you, Carol Blitzer Palo Alto, CA
