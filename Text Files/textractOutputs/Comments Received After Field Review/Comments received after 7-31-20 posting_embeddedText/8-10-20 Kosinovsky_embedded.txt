Name: Gregory A Kosinovsky, Ph.D. Organization: Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory Agenda Item: 2A (History-Social Science Subject Matter Committee/Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum)
Ladies and Gentlemen. Last week I examined, with utmost dismay, the latest proposed draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I found glaring level of Antisemitism both by Commission and by Omission.
First � Antisemitism by Commission. In Appendix A (Course Outlines), the Course with Record ID C94Q67 (Humboldt Charter School (051624), Eureka, CA) had the following Unit: Unit 6: Irish and Jewish Americans: Redefining White and American" In the description of the Unit, the following assignment caught my eye: "Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege." The macabre nature of this assignment is nearly beyond words. The students are supposed to detail "the racial privilege" of 2 of the most oppressed people in history. Specifically the Jews are the singularly most persecuted living ethnicity in the world. More than half of all racial attacks reported in the US over the recent years have been against Jews. At this very moment, a Neo-Nazi "#JewishPrivilege" campaign is the rage of Social Media. Amid this Neo-Nazi campaign, this committee is literally recommending a "#JewishPrivilege" Model High School course. The Antisemitism by Omission may not be as blatant, but it's even more serious. Multiple model courses in the Course outline � including Record ID HJF9TW (Pajaro Valley Joint Unified School District (69799), Watsonville, CA) and Record ID P4XBTN (Golden Valley High School (053871), Santa Clarita, CA) include Arab/Muslim units in their Asian Studies, but no similar units on Israel/Jews. What possible excuse can there be for this blatant bias?
All Jews in the world today -- as well as throughout history -- are native to Asia. It is true that at various points in history large percentages of Jews lived outside Asia � but so have large percentages of Muslims and Arabs (as is the case today). With relatively short recent exceptions, majority of Jews continued living in Asia both throughout ancient history and modern history. Presently, about half of the world Jewish population is living in Asia. Again, what is the excuse?
I would like to believe that these egregious act of commission and omission are not driven by antisemitism, but I am struggling to find any other excuse. I hope that these and other glaring injustices will be promptly addressed and corrected.
Sincerely, Gregory Kosinovsky
