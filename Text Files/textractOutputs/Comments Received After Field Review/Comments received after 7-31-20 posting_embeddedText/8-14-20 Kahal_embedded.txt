From: JT Singh Kahal Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 4:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] My 1 Minute speech,
Dear Committee Members,
Thank You for giving everyone who did not get a chance to speak yesterday to email.
Here are my thoughts, they are within 1 minute as I spent adequate time to prepare.
My name is Jatinder Singh and I am a Sikh from Madera. I am a graduate of the California public school system and a parent to two children in the 4th and 8th Grades. I never saw anything taught about the Sikh community in the classroom, and unfortunately neither have my children.
When they are learning about other religions and communities, but not their own, it excludes them from feeling like they belong. We must learn more about marginalized populations in a positive way and build empathy. Sikhs helped build the railroad systems that we still use to this day in California; the father of fiber optics is a Sikh; and Sikhs helped fuel the end of colonization in South Asia. We have also been a major part in the Agricultural, Medical & transportatio industries and never backed away from the front lines even during events such as this pandemic that we are going through right now.
Reducing the curriculum and only including Sikhs in the context of post 9/11 is neglecting the past 125 years. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, calls for more meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum.
