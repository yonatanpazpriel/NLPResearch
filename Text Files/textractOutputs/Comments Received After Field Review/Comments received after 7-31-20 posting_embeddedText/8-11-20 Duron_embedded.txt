From: Clementina Duron Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CDE Version: Whitewash
To CDE & IQC Members:
I am outraged that Ethnic Studies has come down to this - a whitewashing of the original ESMC Draft that held so much promise. Of course some revisions/additions are going to be made but to destroy basic elements (e.g. exclusion of Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander Studies ) and obfuscate other elements by non-Ethnic Studies experts (changing the original framework, principles and values to a multicultural/diversity/Social Studies framework) negates the very essence of the original draft. This demonstrates how Ethnic Studies has always been a political game by the powers that be and try to deny self-determination by people of color over and over again.
The original Ethnic Studies experts, writers and advisers need to be reconvened and they should revisit the curriculum and determine what changes will not destroy the purpose, pedagogy, values and curriculum of the ESMC Draft.
The revised CDE document does not honor neither the original intent of Ethnic Studies which I was a part of founding at UC Berkeley in 1969 nor 51 years later recognize the enormous contributions that this field of study has provided to the state of California and beyond.
Sincerely, Clementina Durï¿½n OGTWLF@UCB'69
