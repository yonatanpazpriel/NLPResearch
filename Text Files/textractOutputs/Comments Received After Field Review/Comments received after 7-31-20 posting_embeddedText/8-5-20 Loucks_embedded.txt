Hello and Good Afternoon,
I'm a teacher in Northern California who had her life turned around by studying African and World literature for my masters this last year. I am very interested in educating the teachers in my community in Ethnic Studies. It's something we desperately need in the counties of Shasta, Trinity, and Tehama.
I know things are just getting started and the official rollout hasn't occurred. I just want to make my interest known. Thank you so much for all your work on this! If there is anything I can do personally in preparation for being considered for curriculum trainer/professional educator please let me know.
