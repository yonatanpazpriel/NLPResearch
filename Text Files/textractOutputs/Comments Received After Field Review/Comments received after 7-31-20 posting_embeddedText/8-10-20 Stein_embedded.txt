The study of the many ethnic groups that make up this great state can be a valuable tool in teaching respect and tolerance in these trouble times. Unfortunately, the proposed curriculum falls short of this goal. While it is an improvement over the first draft, much work needs to be done to reach this goal. We are diverse. We have Asians who helped build the railroads and Japanese who were put in concentration camps. We have African-Americans who escaped from the Jim-Crow South. We also have Jewish Americans who are Holocaust survivors and their offspring. We have Lebanese and Iranians who fled conflicts in the Middle East as well was many Armenians whose families experience the Armenian genocide. We even have Irish, Italian and Portuguese who helped build this state. You cannot promote diversity and understanding by excluding ethnic groups who don't meet and arbitrary category. We are all Californians. By singling out some groups and excluding others, you are undermining the alleged goals of the legislation. Stop it now and start over. Get new people on board. Educators without preconceived political agendas is what is needed.
