Hi - I am gratified to see improvements to the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in the recommendations made last week by the CDE. It's good to note that most of the explicit antisemitic and anti-Israel content has been removed and there is some encouragement for teachers to enable "multiple and often competing sources of information" so that students can be exposed to diverse viewpoints, rather than promote a particular ideological view. As you know, there are differing perspectives on many of these issues, and the schools must promote mutual respect.
I would still like to see the curriculum include representation by Jews of Color and Middle Eastern Jews (we are not all white), as well as other minorities represented in our state. Additional lesson material on contemporary antisemitism is needed for a fuller understanding of racism and discrimination in America, (particularly in light of the fact that hate crimes against Jews have risen by 71% since 2016, and Jews continue to be the #1 targets of religious based hate crimes in California).
I'd appreciate hearing back from you regarding your intentions to make continuous improvement.
Thank you so much, Mauri
