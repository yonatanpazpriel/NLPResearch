Dear CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission,
On behalf of the Oakland Pacific Islander Network, I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
My name is Alina Fa'aola and I am the founder of the Oakland Pacific Islander Network (OPIN). We are a body made up of community leaders and activists in Oakland, CA and provide resources for Pacific Islander students and families including case management, leadership development, and academic support. We started this organization as a response to the lack of Pacific Islander representation and support in the Oakland Unified School District and continue to see a lack of representation of our community, specifically in the classroom. Pacific Islander students graduate without any knowledge of their cultural history and background. Lack of urgency for representation affects our students' future, how they will view their positions in a society unfavorable to them, and though, unintentional, it is a continued form of oppression in education.
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes both Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact Alina Fa'aola (alinafaaola@oaklandpin.com) to provide further information
Sincerely,
Alina Fa'aola Oakland Pacific Islander Network Founder
