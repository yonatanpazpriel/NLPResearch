From: Brigitte Jaensch Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Revised draft California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Superintendent Thurmond, President of the State Board of Education Darling-Hammond, and Instruction Quality Commission team:
I have reviewed portions of the 2019 and the 2020 drafts of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Although the 2019 draft would benefit from some edits -- additions, deletions, edits -- the Department of Education should be embarrassed to offer the 2020 draft to the people of California.
The 2020 draft does not understand Ethnic Studies as a discipline. It does not provide usable ideas/examples to help teachers who will be expected to present the history and current experiences of the four systemically marginalized groups which make up Ethnic Studies. It stretches and distorts realities and tries to match up concepts which need discrete consideration. And, quite frankly, some of what is included is both ill informed and tone deaf to subtle differences and nuances.
In 1968, the version of the United States that was presented in textbooks was incomplete; it did not reflect the reality experienced by people of color. That's why Ethnic Studies needed to come into being. And there was tremendous resistance to telling what needed to be told.
In 2020, as a nation we are in tumult. And the tension between what is and what needs to be -- what is taught and what needs to be taught -- is even more heightened than in 1968.
Don't foist the shoddy 2020 draft California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum on the K-12 students of California. They deserve better!
Sincerely, Brigitte Jaensch
