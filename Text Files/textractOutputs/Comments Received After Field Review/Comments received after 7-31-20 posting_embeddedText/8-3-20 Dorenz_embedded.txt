From: D Dorenz Sent: Sunday, August 2, 2020 9:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] re: the revised Ca Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Tony Thurmond and the Ca Dept of Education:
I am deeply disappointed in this travesty of a curriculum that fails to include Jews, and other ethnic minorities in our State that have contributed greatly to our CA culture, science, industry, and social justice efforts. If a curriculum is meant to promote fairness, understanding and inclusivement, this one falls way short. In fact, it does the opposite by simplifying the issues that effect all minorities, not just people of color.
The Jewish People continue to suffer from antisemitism here in the United States, as they have over centuries prior to the short lived post war era when Jews were able to live mostly in peace in this country. That reality is changing rapidly. The bias of the committee who wrote this curriculum is evident. It is a bias that defies the very goals of having a CA ethnic studies curriculum. I hope this will be corrected to include many minorities: Jews, East Indians, Koreans and others. Thanks for your attention to my comments. Dorothea Dorenz
