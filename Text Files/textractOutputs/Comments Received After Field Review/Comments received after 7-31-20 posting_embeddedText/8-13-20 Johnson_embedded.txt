Hello,
My name is Adam Johnson and I am a 4th Grade teacher, working for the San Francisco Unified School District.
I would like to thank The CDE and Superintendent Thurmond for moving forward with conversations to include Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies. I would also like to encourage the commission to:
-Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, reconvening the original committee of writers and experts with the inclusion of additional Pacific Islander representation.
-Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism - and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
This is important because ending, rather than contributing to systemic racism benefits us all.
Sincerely, Adam Johnson
