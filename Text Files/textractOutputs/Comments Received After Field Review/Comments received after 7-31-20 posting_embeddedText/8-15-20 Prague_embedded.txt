Esteemed Board Member:
I am writing to demand the implementation of Black experiences, voices, and history in K-12 curriculum.
Subjecting students to a Eurocentric curriculum throughout their most formative years contributes significantly to the perpetuation of systemic racism within schools. This then contributes significantly to the degradation of Black people beyond the classroom.
Please read the full letter of demands here: https://racialequityed.org/demands
These demands are not new. They are an amplification of the calls to action of activists, students, and educators who have asked your school district to immediatelyimplement racially inclusive, anti-racist Ethnic Studies.
The time is long overdue to make change. White supremacy in public education must end now. There is no room for negotiation and placation. The time is now totear down racism and demonstrate your commitment to ending systemic racism perpetuated by the use of Eurocentric curriculum.
