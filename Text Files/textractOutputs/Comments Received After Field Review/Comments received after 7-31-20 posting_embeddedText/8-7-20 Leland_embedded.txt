From: Clyde Leland Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 7:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ATTN: Ethnic Studies must be inclusive.
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
I urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum, to maintain the intent of the Ethnic Studies program.
As a Jewish American whose new understanding of systemic racism led me to consider the oppression of Palestinians in Israel and Palestine, I also have come to recognize the impact that Israel's settlement has on Arab Americans and on Jewish Americans like me. I am personally offended by those who say they speak for me - - not just because the Jewish community is not a politically homogenous group, but also because.
Sincerely, Clyde Leland
