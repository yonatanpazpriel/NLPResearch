From: Ray Berger Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 3:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members,
I am a retired Professor from the California University system.
I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work during this time. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum. If that is not done, this entire misguided curriculum should be abandoned.
Thank you.

Comments on proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
The revised Model Curriculum is an improvement over the original version. However, it continues to favor some ethnic groups over others. For example, it continues to include content that demonizes Israel and it excludes important Middle Eastern communities, including Jews of color. It also continues to include anti-Israel content and promote false narratives about Israel.
How in heavens name does this qualify as education to promote inter-ethnic understanding?
The curriculum includes guidance that encourages teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and to foster respect for diverse viewpoints. But how exactly is this to be accomplished?
At a time when California public schools are among the poorest performing schools in the nation, it is criminal to devote resources to this thinly disguised effort to indoctrinate young students.
If it is not possible to ditch this reprehensible curriculum effort, at the very least it should be revised yet again. This time, please insist on elimination of the biases I have cited above.
