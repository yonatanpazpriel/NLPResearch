Hello, My name is Sarah Farouq and as an Arab American who grew up in the California public education system, I do not remember any mention of Arabs or the Middle East, or when it is mentioned it is always portrayed from a xenophobic, racist, Islamophobic and orientalist point of view. While I'm thrilled to have an ethnic studies model curriculum requirement in the k-12 system, It is important to pass a model that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course specifically including Palestine. Palestinian movements are foundational to the creation of ethnic studies at its core and conflating that with anti-semitism is faulty and harmful. A curriculum that excludes these topics is counter to the purpose of the curriculum which is to promote inclusivity and diversity. I ask that the IQC also consider reconvening the original committee of writers and experts to revise the original ethnic studies model curriculum. I want to see my history and the stories of my people be reflected in this model and not continue to be erased through this proposed curriculum.
Best regards, Sarah Farouq
