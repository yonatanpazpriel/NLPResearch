Dear California Department of Education,
I call on the CDE to hear the voices of Armenian Californians and reflect our histories and experiences in California public education. Scholars estimate Armenian-Americans represent up to 500,000 people in California, with the greatest population of Armenians outside of Armenia residing in California.
I write to you today firmly in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, the calls of Asian American scholars to include West Asian American Studies, and the inclusion of Armenian-Americans within that curriculum.
The students in California do not currently see themselves and their experiences reflected in curricula. ArmenianAmericans have long histories of racialization, immigration, refugeehood, as well as legal, educational and linguistic marginalization. Ethnic Studies helps young students make sense of their realities. Our students deserve "culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining" (ESMC 2).
Don&#039;t cut us out. I urge you to hear community voices calling for the inclusion of West Asian American experiences within Ethnic Studies, and the necessity of Armenian-American histories within that experience.
Sincerely, Tereza Kazanjian
