I am a native Californian with children and grandchildren in California schools. I am concerned about the draft of the ESMC for many reasons: It is politically one sided advocating student resistance, victimhood, and it emphasizes oppression. Instead, it should encourage appreciation for other ethnicities, emphasize self-reliance, and show how what may have been originally "marginalized groups" were able to take advantage of the freedom afforded them in the United States and succeed.
In Sample Lesson 7, "Blowout", the uprising and walkout of Mexican American students at Garfield High School in Los Angeles is taught as an instrument of social change and referred to elsewhere in the curriculum as an example of resistance. Why not emphasize the positive element of the learning, achievement, and graduations of Mexican Americans in Jaime Escalante's math classes as highlighted in the acclaimed film "Stand and Deliver."
Sample Lesson 10 relates the history of the hard working immigrant Chinese men who helped build the Transcontinental Railroad in the late 1800's and emphasizes their oppression. One hundred and fifty years later, the Chinese and other Asian populations are flourishing in the United States. This curriculum could emphasize their cultural values of hard work, study, respect for authority, and family values which Chinese Americans follow to excel in academics, business, and the arts.
