43 Appendix B: Sample Lessons and Topics

44 The following sample lessons are aligned to the to the ethnic studies values, principles, 45 and outcomes from chapter 1 and the state-adopted content standards in history�social 46 science, English language arts and literacy, and English language development. The 47 lessons are sorted by disciplinary area and categorized around the sample themes 48 (Identity, System of Power, Social Movements and Equity, and History and Movement) 49 described in chapter 3, although many of the lessons fit with more than one theme. And 50 while each lesson is placed within one or more disciplinary areas of ethnic studies, 51 many can be adapted to cover other groups.

52 Each of the sample lessons provided in this appendix is organized around a number of 53 essential questions that guide and direct student inquiry. Here are some additional 54 questions that can guide exploration of the guiding themes from chapter 1.

113 General Ethnic Studies 114 Sample Lesson 1: Migration Stories and Oral History

115 Theme: History and Movement

116 Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies

117 Standards Alignment:

118 CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1

119 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 120 6

121 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a

122 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

123 As part of a larger unit on migration, this lesson guides students to explore their 124 personal stories around how migration has impacted their families. The students will 125 learn about how their own family migration stories connect to their local history.

126 Key Terms and Concepts: oral history, migration, interviewing, archive, memory

127 Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

128

1. Conduct oral history interviews, transcribe narratives, develop research

129

questions, and build upon interpersonal communication skills

130

2. Learn from each other by being exposed to the unique migration stories of their

131

peers

132

3. Strengthen their public speaking skills through interviewing and presenting their

133

research findings.

134 Essential Questions:

Page 6 of 121

135

1. How does your family's story connect to your local history?

136 Lesson Steps/Activities:

137

1. Develop a PowerPoint presentation for the lesson opening that highlights several

138

major waves of migration (both voluntary and forced). The slides should also

139

include data on migration to the local community and racial and ethnic

140

demographics.

141

2. Introduce the oral history project to the students by letting them know that they

142

will have an opportunity to learn more their family's and community's migration

143

histories. Task each student with interviewing one family member (preferably an

144

elder) and one community member. The interviews will focus on the

145

interviewee's migration stories, childhood, and memory of the city. You may want

146

to show a clip of an interview from a digital oral history archive (see

147

recommended sources for examples) to provide students an example. Teachers

148

should be sensitive to varying family dynamics and have alternative assignments

149

or activities for students that may have difficulty identifying a family member.

150

3. After introducing the project, provide an overview of the mechanics of oral

151

history. Discuss the types of equipment and materials students will need (an

152

audio or video recording device or application, and field notebook); help students

153

come up with questions, discussing the differences between closed and open-

154

ended questions; and begins to introduce transcribing.

155

4. During the next few class sessions, allow students to engage in peer-

156

interviewing. Students should conduct mini oral history interviews (no more than

157

seven to ten minutes) with each other. After each interview, give students time to

158

reflect on the interviewing process, what they learned, memory, and storytelling.

159

Using the "think, pair, share" method, have students write their own reactions to

160

the interviewing process on a sheet of paper, then have them share it with a

161

peer, and finally to the larger class.

Page 7 of 121

162

� If students have access to headsets and computers in the classroom or

163

nearby, they can use the remaining time to practice transcribing their mini-oral

164

history interviews. After two to three mock oral history interviews with their

165

peers, students should be prepared to carry out their own full interviews with

166

a family elder and community member.

167

5. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a thirty-minute

168

oral history interview with their interviewees, and transcribe at least one

169

interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed

170

over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for

171

copies of old pictures, images of relics that hold some significant meaning or

172

value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.

173

6. After completing the interview and transcribing, students take excerpts from the

174

interview, as well as pictures or other primary sources they may have from their

175

interviewee, and create a three to five minute presentation (either a

176

video, PowerPoint, Prezi, or poster board) discussing their interviewee's

177

migration story, connection to the city, and a brief reflection on their experience

178

conducting the interview. Students are allotted three days to work on their

179

presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an

180

opportunity to practice their presentations with peer to peer and peer to small

181

group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.

182

7. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish

183

norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations,

184

students in the audience should be active listeners, taking notes, and asking

185

follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this

186

time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using

187

"the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.

188

8. As part of the culmination of this project, using these guiding questions students

189

make the broader connection of all migration stories represented in the

190

classroom.

Page 8 of 121

191

� How are our migration stories similar?

192

� How are they different?

193

� How does knowing the shared migration stories of your peers impact how we

194

relate to one another?

195

9. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects

196

with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them

197

on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by

198

coordinating a community presentation event.

199 Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

200

� Peer assessments are used to help students refine their oral history

201

presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the

202

practice groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having

203

difficulty with the assignment.

204

� During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students'

205

presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS

206

for ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.

207

� Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively

208

they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student

209

presenters.

216 Sample Lesson 2: Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement

217 Theme: Social Movements and Equity

218 Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies

219 Standards Alignment:

220 CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1; Historical 221 Interpretation 1, 3, 4

222 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 8; WHST.9�10. 1, 2, 4, 7

223 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 2, 6a, 6c, 11

224 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

225 This primary source analysis assignment turns students into researchers, while 226 simultaneously allowing the students to orient themselves with the history of the Ethnic 227 Studies Movement, and contemporary social movements.

228 The purpose of the lesson is for students to learn, analyze and discuss current social 229 movements happening both in the United States and abroad. By learning about past 230 and present social movements students will learn first-hand how communities of color 231 have resisted and fought for their human rights and self-determination.

232 Key Terms and Concepts: social movement, The Third World Liberation Front, solidarity

233 Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

234

1. Conduct a primary source analysis in relation to social movements and the

235

development of ethnic studies

236

2. Consider how social movements emerge, understand tactics employed, and

237

identify their overall contributions/impact to society

Page 10 of 121

238

3. Engage in critical analysis, learn to decipher credible and non-credible sources,

239

further develop public speaking skills, and work collaboratively

240 Essential Questions:

241

1. What causes social movements?

242

2. What strategies and tactics are most effective within social movements? What

243

gives rise to the proposals and demands of social movements?

244

3. What impact have past and present social movements had on society? Why

245

might people have different responses to social movements?

246 Lesson Steps/Activities:

247

1. Begin the lesson by defining what social movements are and how they start.

248

Introduce the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement and the Third World

249

Liberation Front (TWLF) strike to students. Include in the introduction/overview

250

pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting.

251

Throughout the overview, highlight that the Ethnic Studies Movement was

252

successful due to unity and solidarity building, as well as drawing on momentum

253

from other movements that were happening simultaneously, like, the Black

254

Power, American Indian, Anti-war, Asian American, Chicano, United Farm

255

Workers, and Women's Liberation movements.

256 Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:

257 Chapter 16 of the framework includes an extensive section on the Civil Rights 258 Movement and other movements that fought for social change (beginning on page 414). 259 As part of their research for this ethnic studies lesson, teachers may also ask students 260 to reflect upon past movements and how these modern-day social movements build 261 upon the accomplishments and limitations of those who came before.

Commented [J1]: College students are NOT the only protest form, and startin in 1968 really ignores the long history of America
Commented [J2]: Clearly this movement was not successful since it started in 1968 and only lead to more problems through this day? Why not define success?

Page 11 of 121

262

2. Divide students into pairs, providing each group with two primary source

263

documents including:

264

a. The original demands of the TWLF

265

b. Student proposals for Black, Asian American, Chicano, and Native

266

American studies

Commented [J3]: Other groups should get equal time, why only this group?

267

c. Images from the strike

268

d. Speeches and correspondence written by San Francisco State College

269

administrators concerning the TWLF strike

270

e. Student and Black Panther Party newspaper clippings featuring articles

271

about the TWLF strike

272

3. Introduce each of the materials, providing a small amount of context, and a brief

273

overview of what is a primary source. Instruct each pair to read each document

274

carefully, conduct additional research to better contextualize and situate the

275

source within the history of this period, and to complete a primary source

276

analysis worksheet for each source (see below).

277

4. Provide students with class time to work on this assignment. They should also

278

have an opportunity to work on the assignment as homework.

279

5. After completing the primary source worksheet, each group is paired with another

280

group where they share their primary source analyses with each other. The

281

groups are also tasked with finding themes, commonalities, or connections

282

between their four sources.

283

6. Ask each group to write on a large piece of paper/poster board what they

284

believed were the key tactics/strategies, vision, and goals of the TWLF

285

movement based on their research findings. They can also decorate the poster

286

board with pictures, a copy of their primary source, and other materials.

Commented [J4]: What about decorating a poster documenting police experience, for equal time

Page 12 of 121

287

7. While still in groups of four, assign each group a contemporary social movement.

288

Alternatively, the students can work with the teacher to select the movement that

289

they wish to research.

290

8. Let each group of four know that they are now responsible for completing the two

291

previous assignments (primary source analysis and poster board) with their new

292

social movement. Students are to identify two primary sources on the movement,

293

conduct research (including a review of secondary sources like credible news

294

articles, scholarly research, interviews, informational videos, etc.), and complete

295

the primary source analysis worksheet. They are also to complete a poster board

296

displaying the goals, vision, and tactics/strategies of their assigned contemporary

297

social movement.

298

9. At the end of the unit, each group presents their poster board and social

299

movement to their peers. After all group presentations have been completed,

300

students will have an opportunity to have a class discussion around the impact of

301

social movements. The class will ultimately return back to the original guiding

302

questions for the lesson.

354 African American Studies 355 Sample Lesson 3: U.S. Housing Inequality: Redlining and Racial Housing Covenants

356 Theme: Systems of Power

357 Disciplinary Area: African American Studies

358 Standards Alignment:

359 CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1, 3, 4; Historical 360 Interpretation 1, 2, 3, 5

361 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 4, 7; WHST.9�10. 6, 7

363 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

364 This lesson introduces students to the process of purchasing a home, while addressing 365 the history of U.S. housing discrimination. Students will learn about redlining, racial 366 covenants, and better understand why African Americans, as well as other people of 367 color, have historically settled in certain neighborhoods, whether voluntarily or 368 involuntarily. Additionally, students will be able to better contextualize the state's current 369 housing crisis. With regards to skills, students will analyze primary source documents 370 like original house deeds, conduct research (including locating U.S. census data), and 371 write a brief research essay or complete a presentation on their key findings.

372 Key Terms and Concepts: segregation, racial housing covenants, gentrification, 373 redlining

374 Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

375

1. Draw connections between what they learned from the lesson overview, A Raisin

376

in the Sun, and their own narratives, highlighting the overarching theme of

377

housing inequality.

Commented [J5]: Why only focus on African Americans?
Commented [J6]: Please provide a map of Los Angeles or other local gated community, and census data

Page 17 of 121

378

2. Understand how housing inequality has manifest in the form of institutional

379

racism through racial housing covenants, redlining, and other forms of legalized

380

segregation.

381

3. Engage and comprehend contemporary language being used to describe the

382

current housing crisis and the history of racial housing segregation (i.e.,

383

gentrification, resegregation, and redlining).

384

4. Analyze Lorraine Hansberry's play, A Raisin in the Sun, identifying key themes

385

as they relate to housing discrimination, and become familiar with the use of

386

dramatic devices in written plays

387 Essential Questions:

388

1. How are wealth and housing inequality connected?

389

2. How is housing discrimination and segregation a form of institutional racism?

390 Lesson Steps/Activities:

391

1. Introduce the lesson by posting the definition of "racial housing covenants" and

392

"redlining" to engage students in a discussion on the housing conditions African

393

Americans often encounter in urban cities, both in the past and currently.

394

2. Provide an abbreviated walk-through of how to purchase a home (identifying a

395

realtor, finding a lender, mentioning of the Federal Housing Administration and

396

loan underwriters, etc.). See videos in resources section for more context.

397

a. Make it clear that African Americans have historically been subjected to

398

housing discrimination. Provide the examples of the Federal Housing

399

Administration's refusal to underwrite loans for African Americans looking

400

to purchase property in white neighborhoods through 1968, and the

401

California Rumford Fair Housing Act (1963�1968). Furthermore, provide a

402

more contemporary example of African Americans disproportionately

403

being given poor quality housing loans (subprime), which ultimately

Commented [J7]: Please also explain why Native americans remain on reservations. Provide information on when covenants are not enforced
Commented [J8]: Do you teach how much housing costs? Please use the example of Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama houses that exceed 14 million dollars

resulted in many African American families losing their homes during the

405

2008 economic crash and recession (the use of primary sources such as

406

digital maps are suggested for this part of the lesson).

407

3. Consider using Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun as a supporting text.

408

Have students read Act II Scene III. Following the in-class reading, ask students

409

to reflect on Mr. Lindner's character and how he is connected to the larger

410

discussion of housing inequality. How is Mr. Lindner aiding in housing

411

discrimination?

412

4. After completing A Raisin in the Sun, continue to build on this lesson by

413

introducing students to "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races," two digital mapping

414

websites that include primary sources on redlining and racial housing covenants

415

in the U.S. Then provide students with an overview of the two websites,

416

highlighting the various features and resources.

417

5. For the culminating activity, assign students into pairs where they are tasked with

418

delving into the "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races" archives. After identifying a

419

California city (must be a city that is on the T-RACES digital archive) that each

420

pair would like to study, they should be tasked with completing the following over

421

two weeks:

422

a. Describe how race factors into the makeup of the city being studied

423

b. Identify any racial housing covenants for the city being studied

424

c. List any barriers that may have limited African Americans from living in

425

certain neighborhoods within the city.

426

d. Identify areas where African Americans were encouraged to live or where

427

they were able to create racial enclaves.

428

e. Identify current U.S. Census data and housing maps on how the

429

city/neighborhoods look now, specifically noting racial demographics.

430 Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:

431 Chapter 14 of the framework includes an outline of an elective ethnic studies course. 432 This course outline includes a classroom example (page 313) where students engage in 433 an oral history project about their community. This example includes discussion of 434 redlining and other policies that resulted in "white flight" and the concentration of 435 communities of color into certain neighborhoods.

436 Teachers can expand upon the current lesson by using this example, and connecting it 437 to the themes described in this model curriculum.

438 Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

439 � Students will conduct research (identifying primary sources) on the history of

440

housing discrimination and redlining across California cities.

441 � Students will write a standard four paragraph essay or 5�7 minute oral presentation

442

on their research findings.

443 � Have students reflect on how this history of housing discrimination has (or has not)

444

impacted their own families' housing options and livelihoods.

445 � Students will share their research findings with an audience such as, family,

446

community members, online, elected officials, etc.

458 Act II Scene Three

459 Man in a business suit holding his hat and a briefcase in his hand and consulting a 460 small piece of paper)

461 MAN Uh--how do you do, miss. I am looking for a Mrs.--(He looks at the slip of paper) 462 Mrs. Lena Younger? (He stops short, struck dumb at the sight of the oblivious WALTER 463 and RUTH)

464 BENEATHA (Smoothing her hair with slight embarrassment) Oh--yes, that's my 465 mother. Excuse me (She closes the door and turns to quiet the other two) Ruth! Brother! 466 (Enunciating precisely but soundlessly: "There's a white man at the door!" They stop 467 dancing, RUTH cuts off the phonograph, BENEATHA opens the door. The man casts a 468 curious quick glance at all of them) Uh--come in please.

469 MAN (Coming in) Thank you.

470 BENEATHA My mother isn't here just now. Is it business?

471 MAN Yes ... well, of a sort.

472 WALTER (Freely, the Man of the House) Have a seat. I'm Mrs. Younger's son. I look 473 after most of her business matters. (RUTH and BENEATHA exchange amused glances)

474 MAN (Regarding WALTER, and sitting) Well--My name is Karl Lindner ...

475 WALTER (Stretching out his hand) Walter Younger. This is my wife--(RUTH nods 476 politely)--and my sister.

477 LINDNER How do you do.

Page 21 of 121

478 WALTER (Amiably, as he sits himself easily on a chair, leaning forward on his knees 479 with interest and looking expectantly into the newcomer's face) What can we do for you, 480 Mr. Lindner!
481 LINDNER (Some minor shuffling of the hat and briefcase on his knees) Well--I am a 482 representative of the Clybourne Park Improvement Association--
483 WALTER (Pointing) Why don't you sit your things on the floor?
484 LINDNER Oh--yes. Thank you. (He slides the briefcase and hat under the chair) And 485 as I was saying--I am from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association and we have 486 had it brought to our attention at the last meeting that you people--or at least your 487 mother--has bought a piece of residential property at--(He digs for the slip of paper 488 again)--four o six Clybourne Street ...
489 WALTER That's right. Care for something to drink? Ruth, get Mr. Lindner a beer.
490 LINDNER (Upset for some reason) Oh--no, really. I mean thank you very much, but no 491 thank you.
492 RUTH (Innocently) Some coffee?
493 LINDNER Thank you, nothing at all. (BENEATHA is watching the man carefully)
494 LINDNER Well, I don't know how much you folks know about our organization. (He is a 495 gentle man; thoughtful and somewhat labored in his manner) It is one of these 496 community organizations set up to look after--oh, you know, things like block upkeep 497 and special projects and we also have what we call our New Neighbors Orientation 498 Committee ...
499 BENEATHA (Drily) Yes--and what do they do?
500 LINDNER (Turning a little to her and then returning the main force to WALTER) Well-- 501 it's what you might call a sort of welcoming committee, I guess. I mean they, we--I'm 502 the chairman of the committee--go around and see the new people who move into the
Page 22 of 121

503 neighborhood and sort of give them the lowdown on the way we do things out in 504 Clybourne Park.
505 BENEATHA (With appreciation of the two meanings, which escape RUTH and 506 WALTER) Un-huh.
507 LINDNER And we also have the category of what the association calls--(He looks 508 elsewhere)--uh--special community problems ...
509 BENEATHA Yes--and what are some of those?
510 WALTER Girl, let the man talk.
511 LINDNER (With understated relief) Thank you. I would sort of like to explain this thing in 512 my own way. I mean I want to explain to you in a certain way.
513 WALTER Go ahead.
514 LINDNER Yes. Well. I'm going to try to get right to the point. I'm sure we'll all appreciate 515 that in the long run.
516 BENEATHA Yes.
517 WALTER Be still now!
518 LINDNER Well--
519 RUTH (Still innocently) Would you like another chair--you don't look comfortable.
520 LINDNER (More frustrated than annoyed) No, thank you very much. Please. Well--to 521 get right to the point I--(A great breath, and he is off at last) I am sure you people must 522 be aware of some of the incidents which have happened in various parts of the city 523 when colored people have moved into certain areas--(BENEATHA exhales heavily and 524 starts tossing a piece of fruit up and down in the air) Well--because we have what I 525 think is going to be a unique type of organization in American community life--not only 526 do we deplore that kind of thing--but we are trying to do something about it.
Page 23 of 121

527 (BENEATHA stops tossing and turns with a new and quizzical interest to the man) We 528 feel-- (gaining confidence in his mission because of the interest in the faces of the 529 people he is talking to)--we feel that most of the trouble in this world, when you come 530 right down to it--(He hits his knee for emphasis)--most of the trouble exists because 531 people just don't sit down and talk to each other.
532 RUTH (Nodding as she might in church, pleased with the remark) You can say that 533 again, mister.
534 LINDNER (More encouraged by such affirmation) That we don't try hard enough in this 535 world to understand the other fellow's problem. The other guy's point of view.
536 RUTH Now that's right. (BENEATHA and WALTER merely watch and listen with 537 genuine interest)
538 LINDNER Yes--that's the way we feel out in Clybourne Park. And that's why I was 539 elected to come here this afternoon and talk to you people. Friendly like, you know, the 540 way people should talk to each other and see if we couldn't find some way to work this 541 thing out. As I say, the whole business is a matter of caring about the other fellow. 542 Anybody can see that you are a nice family of folks, hard working and honest I'm sure. 543 (BENEATHA frowns slightly, quizzically, her head tilted regarding him) Today everybody 544 knows what it means to be on the outside of something. And of course, there is always 545 somebody who is out to take advantage of people who don't always understand.
546 WALTER What do you mean?
547 LINDNER Well--you see our community is made up of people who've worked hard as 548 the dickens for years to build up that little community. They're not rich and fancy people; 549 just hard-working, honest people who don't really have much but those little homes and 550 a dream of the kind of community they want to raise their children in. Now, I don't say 551 we are perfect and there is a lot wrong in some of the things they want. But you've got 552 to admit that a man, right or wrong, has the right to want to have the neighborhood he 553 lives in a certain kind of way. And at the moment the overwhelming majority of our 554 people out there feel that people get along better, take more of a common interest in the
Page 24 of 121

555 life of the community, when they share a common background. I want you to believe me 556 when I tell you that race prejudice simply doesn't enter into it. It is a matter of the people 557 of Clybourne Park believing, rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the happiness of all 558 concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities.
559 BENEATHA (With a grand and bitter gesture) This, friends, is the Welcoming 560 Committee!
561 WALTER (Dumbfounded, looking at LINDNER) IS this what you came marching all the 562 way over here to tell us?
563 LINDNER Well, now we've been having a fine conversation. I hope you'll hear me all 564 the way through.
565 WALTER (Tightly) Go ahead, man.
566 LINDNER You see--in the face of all the things I have said, we are prepared to make 567 your family a very generous offer ...
568 BENEATHA Thirty pieces and not a coin less!
569 WALTER Yeah?
570 LINDNER (Putting on his glasses and drawing a form out of the briefcase) Our 571 association is prepared, through the collective effort of our people, to buy the house 572 from you at a financial gain to your family.
573 RUTH Lord have mercy, ain't this the living gall!
574 WALTER All right, you through?
575 LINDNER Well, I want to give you the exact terms of the financial arrangement--
576 WALTER We don't want to hear no exact terms of no arrangements. I want to know if 577 you got any more to tell us 'bout getting together?
578 LINDNER (Taking off his glasses) Well--I don't suppose that you feel ...
Page 25 of 121

579 WALTER Never mind how I feel--you got any more to say 'bout how people ought to sit 580 down and talk to each other? ... Get out of my house, man. (He turns his back and 581 walks to the door) 582 LINDNER (Looking around at the hostile faces and reaching and assembling his hat 583 and briefcase) Well--I don't understand why you people are reacting this way. What do 584 you think you are going to gain by moving into a neighborhood where you just aren't 585 wanted and where some elements--well--people can get awful worked up when they 586 feel that their whole way of life and everything they've ever worked for is threatened. 587 WALTER Get out. 588 LINDNER (At the door, holding a small card) Well--I'm sorry it went like this. 589 WALTER Get out. 590 LINDNER (Almost sadly regarding WALTER) You just can't force people to change their 591 hearts, son. (He turns and put his card on a table and exits. WALTER pushes the door 592 to with stinging hatred, and stands looking at it. RUTH just sits and BENEATHA just 593 stands.

602 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

603 Students will be exposed to contemporary discussions around policing in the U.S., 604 specifically police brutality cases where unarmed African Americans have been killed. 605 They will conduct research on various incidents, deciphering between reputable and 606 scholarly sources versus those with particular political bents. Students will also begin to 607 think about how they would respond if an incident took place in their community. 608 Students will have the opportunity, via the social change projects, to describe what tools 609 and/or tactics of resistance they would use. With regards to skills, students will learn 610 how to develop their own informational videos, conduct research, and work 611 collaboratively.

612 Key Terms and Concepts: racial profiling, oppression, police brutality, social 613 movements, resistance

614 Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

615

1. Develop an understanding and analyze the effectiveness of #BlackLivesMatter

616

and the broader Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), specifically delving into the

617

movement's structure, key organizations, and tactics/actions used to respond to

618

incidents of police brutality.

Page 27 of 121

619

2. Identify how African Americans have been disproportionately impacted by racial

620

profiling and police brutality in the U.S.

621 Essential Questions:

622

1. Why, how, and when did #blacklivesmatter and the Movement for Black Lives

623

emerge?

624

2. What can be done to help those impacted by police brutality and racial profiling?

625 Lesson Steps/Activities:

626

1. Begin the lesson by discussing a recent incident in your community where an

627

African American has been subjected to racial profiling or police brutality. If you

628

are unable to find a specific incident that took place in your community, highlight

629

a national incident.

630

2. Link this incident to the broader Movement for Black Lives. Be sure to provide

631

some context on the movement, including its history, organizations associated

632

with the movement, key activists and leaders, the Movement for Black Lives

633

policy platform, tactics, and key incidents the movement has responded to.

634

3. After completing the reading and discussion, provide an overview of the

635

Movement for Black Lives for students, detailing key shootings, defining and

636

framing terms (i.e. riot vs. rebellion, antiblackness, state sanctioned violence,

637

etc.), highlighting the narratives of Black women and LGBTQIA identifying people

638

that have been impacted by police brutality, and providing various examples of

639

the tactics of resistance used by activists and organizers within the movement.

640

4. In groups of four, assign students a specific police brutality incident that has been

641

a focal point within the Movement for Black Lives. Each group is responsible for

642

researching the following:

643

a. Describe the incident. What are the details surrounding their death?

Page 28 of 121

644

b. What are the arguments? Present all sides.

645

c. Are any laws, policies, or ordinances cited as a justification of their death

646

(e.g., stand your ground, stop and frisk, noise ordinance, police officers bill

647

of rights, etc.)? If so, which?

648

d. What was the community's response? Were there any protests or direct

649

actions? If so, what types of tactics did activists employ?

650

e. What organizations are working to address community concerns raised by

651

this incident?

652

f. What social changes, political changes, or policy changes occurred in the

653

aftermath of this incident?

654

g. What can you do to help support those impacted by police brutality?

655

5. Students are encouraged to identify sources online (including looking at social

656

media posts or hashtags that feature the name of the person they are studying),

657

examine scholarly books and articles, and even contact non-profits or grassroots

658

organizations that may be organizing around the case that they were assigned.

659

Stress the importance of students being able to identify credible first-person

660

sources.

661

6. As a second component of this lesson, each student (individually) is tasked with

662

responding to the last question required for their project, "what can you do to help

663

support those impacted by police brutality?" In response, students must come up

664

with an idea/plan of how they would help advocate for change in their

665

743 Lesson Steps/Activities:

744 Day One: Building Background Knowledge: Four I's of Oppression and Relationship to 745 Salvadoran Migration to the United States

746 In this activity students will be learning about the history and systems of oppression 747 related to the migration of people from El Salvador to the United States. In groups of 748 five, students:

749

1. Begin the activity with the following guiding question: "Why have people

750

emigrated from El Salvador to the United States?" Students should

751

write/pair/share on Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document.

752

2. Have students view and comment on the "primary text" image. Which type(s) of

753

oppression does this text (Primary text-Child's Drawing, San Jose Las Flores,

754

El Salvador) best exemplify? Record the answer(s) on the Four I's of

Page 33 of 121

755

Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document. This is where the primary text

756

can be accessed: "When We Were Young / There Was a War" website

757

http://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/yesenia/.

758

3. Have students watch the documentary "Juan's Story" from When We Were

759

Young website: https://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/juan/. Have

760

students reflect, analyze, and discuss the main themes and types of

761

oppression(s) of "Juan's Story." Record the type of oppression(s) on Four I's of

762

Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document.

763

4. Distribute one of the five informational texts (links listed at the end of unit under

764

"Lesson One Materials/Resources) to each student in the small groups of five.

765

Each student will read and annotate one of the texts for important ideas and

766

record key ideas in the "Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One

767

Document." When sharing ideas, each group member should teach the other

768

group members about the content and discuss the type of oppression in their

769

respective article.

770

5. Ask students to collaborate to answer the following two discussion questions.

771

Ask one member from each of the groups to present the group response:

772

a. What did you appreciate about this lesson?

773

b. What new insights do you have about immigration to the United States?

774 Day Two: Youth Scholars Teach U.S. Immigration Policy Shifts to the People

775 In this activity, students will investigate how U.S. immigration policies evolved in 776 response to historical events. Small groups will be assigned to research one of five 777 shifts in immigration policy and collaborate to create presentation slides on the new 778 policy.

779

1. Distribute the Push and Pull Factors Activity handout to students. Instruct

780

students to work independently first to rank the factors in terms of which have

Page 34 of 121

781

historically been the three most significant push and pull factors prompting

782

immigration to the United States. They must then select the top three most

783

significant current push and pull factors and explain why they choose those

784

factors.

785

2. Once students have determined their rankings, group them in fours and instruct

786

them to compare their rankings, and to try to come to a consensus on the top

787

three factors for each as a group. Instruct each group to share their top factors

788

for each with the class, and then facilitate a short discussion, noting similarities

789

and differences between each group's answers while asking probing questions to

790

get students to support their arguments with evidence.

791

3. Inform students that they will be learning about how the actual immigration

792

system determines who is able to immigrate and who isn't. They will work in

793

small groups to research one of six immigration policies beginning with the

794

Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965. Distribute the Immigration

795

Presentation Assignment Sheet and explain the expectations to students. (For

796

more background on the racist origins of the Immigration Act of 1924 you can

797

read with students "DACA, The 1924 Immigration Act, and American Exclusion"

798

in the Huffington Post, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/daca-the-1924-

799

immigration-act-and-american-exclusion_b_59b1650ee4b0bef3378cde32).

800

4. Next, assign students to small groups to research one of the six policies

801

regulating the American immigration system since 1965.

802

5. Have students start their research by reading the relevant section of Juan's story

803

on the tab marked "U.S. Immigration: A Policy in Flux" to get basic background

804

overview of their assigned policy

805

(https://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/juan/#top). Directions for

806

which paragraph of "A Policy in Flux" to read for each topic are in parenthesis

807

behind the topic title on the assignment sheet. Additional links are provided for

808

each of the other topics, but students can research additional online resources to

809

create their presentations.

Page 35 of 121

810

6. Instruct students to use the Immigration Presentation Assignment Sheet to

811

prepare the research for presentation on a slide presentation program. Have

812

students analyze which of the Four I's of Oppression explain the implementation

813

of the immigration policy and include it in the slides presentation.

814

7. Have students refer back to the opening activity, and ask which of the factors

815

determining immigration preference influenced each of the policies. Naturally,

816

this will lead to a discussion of whether the United States is implementing a fair

817

and principled immigration policy.

Four I's of Oppression

Student Answer

Ideological Oppression

[student response]

The idea that one group is better than another, and has the right to control the "other" group. The idea that one group is more intelligent, more advanced, more deserving, superior, and hold more power. The very intentional ideological development of the ...isms Examples: dominant narratives, "Othering."

Commented [J14]: Doesn't this ignore effort and reward? Provide examples of each group that have succeeded in the US, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson, Michael Jordan, others

Page 39 of 121

Four I's of Oppression

Student Answer

Institutional Oppression

[student response]

The network of institutional structures, policies, and practices that create advantages and benefits for some, and discrimination, oppression, and disadvantages for others. (Institutions are the organized bodies such as companies, governmental bodies, prisons, schools, nongovernmental organizations, families, and religious institutions, among others).

Commented [J15]: How are families institutions?

Page 40 of 121

Four I's of Oppression

Student Answer

Interpersonal Oppression

[student response]

Interactions between people

where people use oppressive

behavior, insults or violence.

Interpersonal racism is what

white people do to people of

color up close--the racist

jokes, the stereotypes, the

beatings and harassment, the

threats, the whole range of

personal acts of discrimination.

Similarly, interpersonal sexism

is what men to do to women--

the sexual abuse/harassment,

the violence directed at women,

the sexist jokes, ignoring or

minimizing of women's thinking,

etc. Many people in each

dominant group are not

consciously oppressive. They

have internalized the negative

messages about other groups,

and consider their attitudes

towards other groups quite

normal.

Commented [J16]: People of all colors do this not only white people. What words and phrases are common among blacks, latinos and others

Page 41 of 121

Four I's of Oppression

Student Answer

Internalized Oppression

[student response]

The process by which a member of an oppressed group comes to accept and live out the inaccurate myths and stereotypes applied to the group by its oppressors. Internalized oppression means the oppressor doesn't have to exert any more pressure, because we now do it to ourselves and each other. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, the see it reflected in the institutions, they experience mistreatment interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves.

947 Lesson Purpose and Overview:
948 The lesson is applicable to many U.S. urban areas but is written specifically about the 949 Los Angeles Boyle Heights area. Some students in urban working-class communities 950 have been impacted by gentrification (the process of upgrading a neighborhood while 951 pushing out working class communities), the growing housing crisis, and being 952 undocumented/DACAmented. Consequently, many families have experienced detention 953 and deportation, while others express growing concerns of being pushed out of their 954 community altogether.
955 This lesson introduces students to the plight of undocumented immigrants, gentrification 956 in the greater Los Angeles area, cultural preservation vs. assimilation, and Greek 957 mythology and tragedy. Students will learn about the use of immigrant laborers for the 958 construction and garment industry; the impact of drug cartels and lack of opportunities 959 in Mexico and how that factors into people's decision to emigrate; and how 960 contemporary playwrights of color are leveraging ancient literature and theatre to 961 discuss modern-day issues.

1068 1069 1070

3. Have students demonstrate their knowledge by developing and delivering a brief presentation that highlights the concepts learned from the play to current topics of immigration and gentrification in their respective communities.

1071 Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the English 1072 Language Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) Framework:

1073 1074 1075 1076 1077 1078

These two curriculum frameworks contain an extensive lesson example that shows how teachers can work with colleagues across disciplines to address a common topic. In this case, the example is how a language arts teacher and history�social science teacher collaborate to teach the novel Things Fall Apart, addressing both language arts and history�social science standards in their instruction (the example begins on page 338 in the History�Social Science Framework, and page 744 of the ELA/ELD Framework).

1079 1080 1081 1082 1083 1084

Ethnic studies educators should also consider how they can collaborate with their peers to integrate ethnic studies instruction with content in other areas. Depending on which grade level the ethnic studies course is being offered, the ethnic studies educator can include a literary selection that connects to the content students are studying in their history�social science classroom, or work with the language arts teacher on lessons that address grade-level standards in reading or writing.

1121 1122

4. What is the role of education and who should have the power to shape what is taught?

1123 Lesson Steps/Activities:

1124 1125 1126

1. Open the class by displaying the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times article, "East L.A., 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement:

1127 1128 1129

"LOS ANGELES -- Teachers at Garfield High School were winding down classes before lunch. Then they heard the startling sound of people running the halls, pounding on classroom doors. `Walkout' they were shouting. `Walkout!'

1130 1131 1132

Students left classrooms and gathered in front of the school entrance. They held their clenched fists high. `Viva la revoluci�n!' they called out. `Education, not eradication!'

1133 1134 1135

It was just past noon on a sunny Tuesday, March 5, 1968 -- the day a revolution began for Mexican-Americans, people whose families came to the United States from Mexico."

1136 1137 1138 1139 1140 1141 1142

2. Proceed to ask students why they think students at Garfield were shouting "Walkout", and what do the phrases "Viva la revoluci�n!" and "Education, not eradication!" mean? In pairs, students discuss the above questions, later sharing their thoughts with the entire class. Following discussion, provide definitions for the following terms: protest, eradication, revoluci�n, uprising, Chicano, Brown Berets, and unrest. Then instruct students to read, "East L.A. 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement".

3. After giving students about fifteen minutes to read the article and discuss their immediate reactions in think, pair and share formats, proceed to write down any questions students may have about the article on the board and respond to them.
a. To supplement the article, play a short video clip on the youth movement, "The 1968 student walkout that galvanized a national movement for Chicano rights."
4. Following the screening, lead a discussion about how the students experienced police aggression and were even targeted with federal charges for "invoking riots." Be sure to emphasize that the students were resilient and persisted in other forms of protest by organizing their peers and parents, and attending school board meetings where they presented a list of demands.
5. Hand each pair a copy of the two primary sources listed below.
"Student Walkout Demands," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Board of Education
No student or teacher will be reprimanded or suspended for participating in any efforts which are executed for the purpose of improving or furthering the educational quality in our schools.
Bilingual-Bi-cultural education will be compulsory for Mexican-Americans in the Los Angeles City School System where there is a majority of Mexican-American students. This program will be open to all other students on a voluntary basis.
In-service education programs will be instituted immediately for all staff in order to teach them the Spanish language and increase their understanding of the history, traditions, and contributions of the Mexican culture.
All administrators in the elementary and secondary schools in these areas will become proficient in the Spanish language. Participants are to be compensated during the training period at not less than $8.80 an hour and upon completion of

the course will receive in addition to their salary not less than $100.00 a month. The monies for these programs will come from local funds, state funds and matching federal funds.
Administrators and teachers who show any form of prejudice toward Mexican or Mexican-American students, including failure to recognize, understand, and appreciate Mexican culture and heritage, will be removed from East Los Angeles schools. This will be decided by a Citizens Review Board selected by the Educational Issues Committee.
Textbooks and curriculum will be developed to show Mexican and MexicanAmerican contribution to the U.S. society and to show the injustices that Mexicans have suffered as a culture of that society. Textbooks should concentrate on Mexican folklore rather than English folklore.
All administrators where schools have majority of Mexican-American descent shall be of Mexican- American descent. If necessary, training programs should be instituted to provide a cadre of Mexican-American administrators.
Every teacher's ratio of failure per students in his classroom shall be made available to community groups and students. Any teacher having a particularly high percentage of the total school dropouts in his classes shall be rated by the Citizens Review Board composed of the Educational Issues Committee.
"Student Rights," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Board of Education:
Corporal punishment will only be administrated according to State Law.
Teachers and administrators will be rated by the students at the end of each semester.
Students should have access to any type of literature and should be allowed to bring it on campus.

Students who spend time helping teachers shall be given monetary and/or credit compensation.
Students will be allowed to have guest speakers to club meetings. The only regulation should be to inform the club sponsor.
Dress and grooming standards will be determined by a group of a) students and b) parents.
Student body offices shall be open to all students. A high-grade point average shall not be considered as a pre-requisite to eligibility.
Entrances to all buildings and restrooms should be accessible to all students during school hours. Security can be enforced by designated students.
Student menus should be Mexican oriented. When Mexican food is served, mothers from the barrios should come to the school and help supervise the preparation of the food. These mothers will meet the food handler requirements of Los Angeles City Schools and they will be compensated for their services.
School janitorial services should be restricted to the employees hired for that purposes by the school board. Students will [not] be punished by picking up paper or trash and keeping them out of class.
Only area superintendents can suspend students.
6. After reading the primary source documents, proceed to have the pairs construct what their own demands would be if they were to organize a presentation to the Board of Education on flip chart paper. Once the pairs have completed their own demands, then task the students with responding to the following reflection questions related to the primary sources listed above:
a. What student demand do you think is the most important, and why?
b. What is one student right you would add to this list?

Page 64 of 121

1318

1. What is the history of Hmong immigration to the U.S.?

1319 1320

2. How did first generation Hmong immigrants' experiences differ from their children who were born in the U.S.? How did gender factor into differing experiences?

1321 Lesson Steps/Activities:

1322 1323 1324

1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone here has experiences or a personal identity that they feel could help others better understand this content, feel free, but not required, to add to our discussions"

1325 1326 1327
1328 1329 1330

2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about the Hmong in America and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about the Hmong. The teacher asks students if they have questions about the Hmong, and writes them on the white board.

1331 1332 1333 1334

4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong community in the U.S. Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.

1335 1336

5. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.

1337 1338 1339 1340 1341

6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Hmong experience in the U.S., focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a video interview of a Hmong couple who immigrated to the U.S. Note that the videos have subtitles and that students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured to get to the U.S as they watch the video:

Mee Lee also is fleeing war torn Laos, and her husband dies during the escape. Mee found herself as a near death, broken widow in the Thailand refugee camps. After losing everything, a miracle happens and these two widows find each other and a new reason for life again in each other. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWU5zP-B6g (9 mins)
7. The teacher shows two spoken word poems of two teenage Hmong females. As students watch them, they should think about how these individuals have developed their identity as being Hmong American. As students watch, they should consider what it is like to be a young Hmong American woman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XxuyYI6ho
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (How do these poets describe their experiences and young Hmong-American women?) for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� being caught between two worlds, with their parents and the pressures of American society, language barrier with parents and not fully accepted into the American society
� the frustration they feel not being appreciated for being Hmong but rather being called Chinese or from Hong Kong
� living in a patriarchy and family expectations, and family hypocrisies
� feeling ashamed not meeting the high expectations of the American educational system

� developing an identity of their own as proud Hmong Americans
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Criminalization and Second Generation of Hmong American Boys." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Hmong American male? (pages 113-116, "Criminalization and Second Generation Hmong American Boys" by Bao Lo.)
a. As students read the article, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text � annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Bao Lo, what is it like to be a young Hmong American male?
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Similar to African American and Latino young males, Hmong young males are thought of as gangsters, drop outs and delinquents by law enforcement and authority figures.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding incarceration and criminalization in research and public policy shows a need to understand it better.
iii. Teachers often treat the dress of baggy clothing, quietness, and swaggering of the Hmong boys as deviant.

1395 1396 1397
1398 1399 1400 1401 1402

iv. This implicit bias among authority members leads to racial profiling of Hmong boys and leads to the boys feeling of isolation and frustration.
v. The criminalization of men and boys of color goes hand in hand with the decriminalization of white males as a result white criminality is less controlled, surveilled and punished while black, Latino, and Southeast Asian criminality is treated at threatening and in need of punishment.

1403 Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:

1404 1405 1406 1407

Chapter 16 of the framework includes a description of the impact of the Vietnam War, including the experiences of refugees. On pages 423�425 there is a classroom example where students study the impact of the war on the United States. You can extend this context to this lesson by asking students to research the following questions:

1408 � How did the Vietnam War affect Hmong immigration to the United States? 1409 � How the experience of the war affect perceptions of Hmong immigrants?

1410 1411

10. Assessment � To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments:

1412 1413

a. Write a paragraph of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or

Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong in the U.S.
� The Hmong are an ethnic group that lives in the mountains primarily in southern China, Laos, Burma, northern Vietnam and Thailand. They are a subgroup of the Miao ethnic group and have more than one dialect within and among the different Hmong communities.
� During the Vietnam War, Laos also experienced a civil war in which three princes sought control over the Royal Lao government. One of the princes sought support from the Vietnamese communists, while the other sought support from the U.S. Both sides swept in and recruited Hmong to join their military forces.
� The most successful was the Royal Lao government, which was backed by the U.S. CIA.
� In 1961, 18,000 young Hmong men joined the U.S. backed armies in the Secret War in Laos with the promise that the Royal Lao government and the U.S. would take care of them if Laos fell to the communists.
� When Vietnam and Laos fell to the communists in 1973, the Hmong were persecuted by the communists causing most to flee their homeland. The majority crossed the Mekong River and made their way to Thailand to live in refugee camps.
� Several families stayed in these camps for years until being processed and either returned to their home countries or sent to the U.S.
� The U.S. refugee resettlement Act of 1980 brought in over 200,000 Hmong families to live in cities spread across the U.S. from 1980-2000.
� Over the years, the Hmong migrated to specific Hmong ethnic enclaves within U.S. cities within California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.

1453 1454 1455 1456

� From the mid-1980s�2000s there has been a gradual rise in undergraduate college enrollment particularly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California. This has led to college courses on Hmong language and Hmong American history and culture.

1457 1458 1459

� Today there are large Hmong communities in Fresno, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Sacramento, Merced, Milwaukee, Wausau, and Green Bay, with the total population over 300,000.

1460 1461

� The Hmong have played a key role in helping the farm communities grow and flourish.

1462 1463

� The rich Hmong culture involved embroidery, story clothes, ghost stories, and many rituals.

1464 1465 1466 1467

� Although the Hmong fall under the category of Asian American in the U.S., they endure one of the highest poverty rates at 37.8 in 2004 among all ethnic groups so they do not receive the services they need because they have been lumped into the Asian American group.

1468 1469

� The Hmong struggle with the dual identities of being labeled as the Model Minority or as criminals for the young males.

5. Excerpt from Our Stories in Our Voices "Filipinos and Mexicans for the United Farm Workers Union" by James Sobredo:
a. By the 1950s and 1960s, the remaining Filipinos in the United States are now much older. They were also working side-by-side with other Mexican farm workers. Then in 1965, under the leadership of Larry Itliong, Filipinos went on strike for better salaries and working conditions in Delano. Itliong had been a long-time labor union organizer, but although they won strikes in the past, they had never been able to gain recognition as a union for farm workers. To make matters worse, when Filipinos went on strike,

1564 1565 1566 1567 1568 1569 1570 1571 1572 1573 1574 1575 1576 1577

1591 1592 1593

Mexican farm workers were brought in by the farmers to break the strike; in the same way, when Mexican farm workers went on strike, Filipinos were brought in to break their strike. Itliong recognized this problem, so he asked Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, who had been organizing Mexican farm workers, to meet with him. Itliong asked Chavez to join the Filipino grape strike, but Cesar refused because he did not feel that they were ready. It was Huerta, who had known Itliong when she lived and worked in Stockton, who convinced Chavez to join the Filipino strike. Thus, for the first time in history, Filipinos and Mexicans joined forces and had a unified strike for union recognition and workers' rights. This led to the establishment of the United Farm Workers union (UFW), which brought together the Filipino workers of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and the Mexican workers of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in a joint strike.
One of the important labor actions the UFW did to gather support for the Grape Strike was a 300-mile march from the UFW headquarters in Delano in the Central Valley to the State Capitol in Sacramento. The march started on March 17, 1966, when 75 Filipino and Mexican farm workers started their long trek down from Delano, taking country roads close to Highway 99, all the way up to Sacramento. They were stopping and spending the night at small towns along the way, giving speeches, theater performances, and singing songs. They were following the tradition of nonviolent protests started by Mahatma Gandhi in India and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the South. The march to Sacramento was very successful. By the time, the Filipinos and Mexicans arrived in Sacramento, they were now 10,000 marchers strong, and the march brought more media coverage and national support to the UFW grape strike...
The connection to the Filipino and Mexican farmworkers remains a strong thread in the California Assembly. Rob Bonta (Democrat, 18 District) is the first Filipino American Assembly member to be elected to office. He is the

son of Filipino labor union organizers and grew up in La Paz, in Kern County, in a "trailer just a few hundred yards from Cesar Chavez's home." His parents were civil rights activists and labor union organizers who worked with the UFW to organize Filipino and Mexican farm workers...

6. While students are working in groups, write down the eight key terms on the white board, leaving plenty room between each. After the time has expired, signal to students that it is time to come back together. Facilitate a discussion where students are able to respond to each of the guiding questions aloud. Finally, ask one member from each group to go to the board. Each student is assigned a word and is expected to write their definition of the word with their group's support. After completing this task, the class talks through each term. Provide additional information, examples, and support to better clarify and define the terms.

1. Bring to class a carton of strawberries and grapes, several pieces of sugar cane, and a few asparagus spears. Engage the class by asking how many students have ever worked on a farm or have grown their own food? Then ask if anyone knows how the food items brought in are grown and/or harvested? Let students know that the food items brought in are among some of the most labor-intensive to harvest, are in high demand, and are largely hand-picked or cut by often under-paid farm workers. Proceed to display images detailing the process of each crop being harvested. Be sure to highlight that farm labor is often repetitive and menial, yet damaging to the body. After completing this overview, allow the students to eat the food items brought in.

1619 1620 1621

2. After the discussion about harvesting crops, play "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun", a song by Daniel Valdez that was popularized during the United Farm Workers Movement. After listening to the song, ask students what the song is

about? Allow for about ten minutes of discussion followed by an overview on protest songs and music that were played/sung while Filipino and Mexican workers toiled the fields and during protests. The overview should foreground the Filipino contribution in the UFW, like the book Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itliong. Then proceed to describe how protest and work songs provided a unifying message, energized crowds during rallies and marches, and helped amplify dissent.
3. Following this overview, divide students into pairs. Each pair is then assigned a protest or work song from the list below (students also have the option to create their own protest song):
a. "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun" by Daniel Valdez, Sylvia Galan, and Pedro Contreras
b. "Huelga En General"/ "General Strike" by Luis Valdez
c. "El Esquirol"/ "The Scab" by Teatro Campesino
d. No Nos Mover�n e. "Pastures of Plenty" by Woody Guthrie
f. "Solidaridad (Pa) Para Siempre" (Solidarity forever)
g. "Nosotros Venceremos" (We shall overcome)
4. Let the pairs know that they will be responsible for completing a two-page cultural analysis essay that must address the following steps and prompts:
a. Find the lyrics and an audio recording of your assigned song.
b. Analyze the song and identify three to five key themes or points.
c. What is the purpose and/or meaning of this song?
d. Who is the intended audience?

The contributions of people of color to the development of the economic development and infrastructure of the United States are too often minimized or overlooked. Chinese Americans are Americans and have played a key role in building this country. Had it not been for this work force, one of the greatest engineering feats of the 19th century (the railroad), would not have been built within the allotted timeline. Asian Americans have been active labor organizers and strikers throughout history to fight racism and exploitation. The image of the transcontinental railroads meeting at Promontory Point on May 10, 1969, with no Chinese workers exemplifies the white supremacy view of U.S. history.

5. Provide students time to reflect on what they have seen in the video by having students complete a five-minute free-write brainstorm on the following questions: Based on the interviews in the video, why is it important to recognize of the contributions of Chinese laborers? Why is that recognition meaningful to people within the Chinese-American community? How does the exclusion of Chinese and Chinese-American contributions to the United States, including the railroad, affect our understanding of history?

When the discussion begins to wind down, have the class reconvene as a whole group. Have students share their thoughts and ideas with the whole class.
7. Tell students that this video shows the importance of recognizing the contributions of Chinese laborers more than one hundred years after the building of the railroad. Ask students these final questions: How do you think Chinese laborers and Chinese immigrants were treated at the time? Provide students with copies of excerpts from David Phillips' discussion of "The Chinese Question," Edward Holton's observations about Dennis Kearney, and "Enactments So Utterly Un-American" by Constance Gordon-Cumming, which can all be found on the Library of Congress website: https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/pres entations/timeline/riseind/chinimms/. As students read, have them identify the conflicting attitudes towards the presence of Chinese laborers in California, noting the arguments presented for the exclusion and inclusion of Chinese laborers.
8. After students have read the document excerpts, explain to students that the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Have students look up this event in their textbooks and discuss with a partner whether or not they think the information provided is satisfactory. Have students come up with a list of questions they have about the Chinese Exclusion Act.

Every year on May 10, the Golden Spike Foundation commemorates the coming together of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads to create the Transcontinental Railroad. Every year, there is little to no representation of the Chinese laborers who have built the central pacific railroad. With your group, brainstorm a list of ways that the committee could recognize the contributions of Chinese laborers and how they can increase awareness of their contributions. Then, compose a professional, persuasive letter to the committee that explains why the

2107 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

2108 2109 2110 2111 2112 2113 2114 2115

This lesson will introduce students to Native American and Mexican cuisine, with a focus on planting, indigenous Mexican ingredients, the four periods of Native American cuisine, and Mexican cookery. Students will learn about biodiversity and how to "decolonize your diet". Before introducing this lesson, it is recommended that the teacher research and introduce students to the history of Native American tribes nearby and in the region where their school is located. In addition to exposing students to Native American and Mexican diets, this lesson will help students understand how these two foodways and cultures are connected.

2116 Key Terms and Concepts: foodways, colonialism, decolonization, biodiversity, well2117 balanced diet, talking circles.

2118 Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

2119 2120

1. Develop an understanding of Native American and Mexican American culture, and draw links between the two through the lens of food.

Page 103 of 121

2121 2122 2123 2124

2. Research and develop an activity that will demonstrate their understanding of a Native American cultural practice, like growing indigenous plants and cooking traditional Native American and Mexican foods that can be shared with their peers, families, and respective communities.

2125 Essential Questions:

2126

1. What does it mean to "decolonize your diet"?

2127

2. How has colonialism impacted Mexican and Native American foodways?

2128 Lesson Steps/Activities:

2129 Day 1

2130 2131 2132 2133

1. Ask students to pull out a sheet of paper for a quick free writing exercise. Instruct students to write down some cultural food dishes specific to their backgrounds. Also ask students to write what comes to mind when they think about Native American food.

2134 2135 2136 2137 2138 2139 2140 2141 2142

2. After giving the students about three to five minutes to respond to the prompts, ask students to share some of their responses aloud. After everyone has shared their responses, begin to introduce the Native American food tradition of the "Three Sisters". Explain that the "Three Sisters" are corn, beans, and squash, which represent some of the most important crops to Native Americans broadly. These crops provide a well-balanced diet--carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, and amino acids, can be planted together (companion planting), and can be stored for long periods of time when dried. Teachers should also show some images of traditional Native American dishes that can be made with the "Three Sisters."

2143 2144 2145 2146 2147

3. Following the introduction to the "Three Sisters", play the video "Why You Must Try Native American Cuisine" and ask students to write down any vocabulary words that they might be unfamiliar with and to take notes. After watching the film, have students use the duration of the class period to read and annotate the vignette below. Before closing out for the day, explain that tomorrow the class will engage in

Page 104 of 121

2148 2149 2150

a "talking circle," where they will have a conversation about Native American and Mexican food and how to "decolonize your diet." Instruct students to come prepared with at least two guiding questions for discussion.

2151 4. Close with student and community reflection on the film.

2152 Day 2

2153 1. If the teacher is familiar with community circles the following activity is

2154

recommended:

2155

a. Start by having students arrange their chairs into a circle.

2156 2157 2158

b. Explain that talking circles have historically been facilitated by some Native American tribes to reflect, problem-solve, grieve, brainstorm, or just come together to build community.

2159 2160 2161 2162

i. Also note that some circles will often use an object to represent a talking piece to help facilitate discussion--whoever has the talking piece is the only person allowed to speak. Instead of using a talking piece, ask students to respect the rule--one mic, one voice.

2163 2164 2165

ii. Ideally the class should have created a list of community agreements at the start of the year, if you have not, it is recommended that you create some in collaboration with your students for this discussion.

2166 2167 2168 2169 2170

2. Have students take turns asking and responding to guiding questions. Also create a list of your own guiding questions that you can use to support students through the talking circle discussion. If the teacher is not familiar with talking circles, the guiding questions can be done in collaborative groups, as a whole class discussion or individual writing prompts.

2171 3. Guiding Questions:

2172

a. What are the four periods of Native American cuisine?

Page 105 of 121

2173

b. What does decolonize mean?

2174

c. How can you decolonize your diet?

2175

d. What are the "magic eight"?

2176 2177

e. How is Native American cuisine connected to current zero-waste and vegan/plant-based movements?

2178 2179

f. What do traditional Mexican and Native American foodways have in common? How are they different?

2180 2181

g. How did colonialism directly impact health inequities amongst Native American tribes?

2182 2183

h. What is a food desert? How does living in a food desert affect community health?

2184

i. What is biodiversity?

2185 2186 2187 2188 2189

4. After about 25-30 minutes of discussion, introduce a new project for the students. Design a cultural production assignment that will be showcased for parents and the school community to see/experience. Students are given the option of producing one of the following (note � students with no access to resources should be provided with an alternate cultural assignment):

2190 2191 2192 2193 2194 2195 2196 2197 2198

a. Cook: Research at least five different Native American recipes across the four periods of Native American cuisine. Have students research in depth the history of the food ingredients and the history of the tribes that harvested the ingredients. After studying the various ingredients and recipe steps, work to create your own Native American-inspired dish. Each student will be responsible for creating a dish that can serve (small appetizer portions) at least 20 people. In addition to making the dish, each student will need to create 20 recipe cards listing the steps, ingredients, and a brief chef's statement explaining the significance of the dish. Alternatively, if students are

Page 106 of 121

2199 2200 2201 2202

not allowed to bring prepared foods to school, students could record a cooking-show style video preparing a dish dishes, compile a cookbook (digital or print) that includes photos of dishes they made, or create a menu of dishes (appetizers, main, dessert) that can be shown or displayed.

2203 2204 2205 2206 2207 2208 2209 2210

b. Grow: Beyond the "Three Sisters" and "magic eight" identify at least five other herbs, vegetables, and/or grains significant to Native American or Mexican cuisine. Write a brief report on these ingredients identifying where they are commonly grown, how they are used, how they are planted, and their significance (if any) to specific Native American tribes. In addition to the report, students will grow their own mini gardens. Each student will grow at least one herb and/or vegetable. Students should try to plant items that grow best during the current season, use seeds, and plant in an easily portable pot.

2211 2212 2213 2214 2215 2216 2217 2218 2219 2220

c. Learn: Research at least five different Native American recipes across the four periods of Native American cuisine or traditional Mexican recipes. Arrange a time to share what you have learned with an elder or the primary cook in your family. In addition to sharing these recipes, each student will also conduct a brief interview with the person they identified. Students are expected to come up with at least four questions to ask their interviewee, they should address the following: their family member's style of cooking, favorite recipes, cooking memories, etc. Each interview must include the interviewee sharing a family recipe. These interviews should be video recorded and the final video should be no more than three to five minutes.

2221 2222 2223 2224 2225 2226

5. After explaining the three cultural production assignment options, students use the remainder of their time to begin brainstorming and outlining their projects. Provide students time in class to complete the assignment for the next week. For the community event, the students all bring in their cultural production assignments to showcase. Have students line their plants up on a shelf in the rear of the room. The video interviews are playing on a loop via the classroom projector. And "tasting

2227 2228

stations" are setup around the room for parents and guests to sample some of the dishes that were made.

2229 6. Close with student, parent, and community reflection.

2230 Making Connections to the Health Education Framework:

2231 2232 2233 2234 2235

Review the Nutrition and Physical Activity section in Chapter 6 of the framework, which addresses the Health Education Standards for high school. This section includes a Learning Activity where students critique their personal diet for overall balance of key nutrients. How does the nutritional benefits of the diet addressed in this ethnic studies lesson compare to the contemporary diets of most Americans?

2236 Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

2237 2238

� Students will respond to writing prompts that will demonstrate understanding of Native American and traditional Mexican cuisine and diet.

2239 2240

� Students will generate discussion questions that will help facilitate a dialogue about Native American cuisine and diet.

2241 2242

� Students can start a school campaign to include Native American and Mexican cuisine into their school lunch menu.

In 1521, Spanish conquistadores, led by Hern�n Cort�s, conquered the city of Tenochtitl�n, the capital and religious center of the Mexica (Aztec) empire. Over the ensuing centuries, millions of indigenous peoples were killed or died of disease brought by the colonizers. Many indigenous people were forced to convert to Christianity. Some foods, such as amaranth in Mesoamerica and quinoa in the Andes, were outlawed because of their use in indigenous religious ceremonies. At the time of the Conquest, there were hundreds of indigenous groups, each with distinct languages, religious beliefs, and cultures. In the area that is now Mexico, in addition to the Mexica (Aztec) there were Mxtec, Zapotec, Maya, Pur�pecha, Otomi, Huichol, Tarahumara, Yaqui, Seri, O'odham, and many others. Over time, Spanish colonizers gained control of the land and resources of most of these indigenous groups, often through violent exertions of power. Because they were the most powerful group in Mesoamerica, there are many resources about the Mexica culture at the time of the Conquest, and through study, we can learn quite a bit about their food, ceremonies, and social organization. Other indigenous groups keep this information through oral tradition, and it is not as widely known or recoverable to those of us not connected to our ancestors...

2276 2277 2278

We believe that indigenous cultural traditions in religion, art, music, literature, and food were never completely suppressed by the colonizers but kept alive, sometimes surreptitiously, through daily acts of storytelling, cooking, and prayer. In a Chicana/o

context, one important site of this maintenance of indigenous knowledge and culture is the tradition of passing down recipes from generation to generation. Learning to make a corn tortilla or preparing a pot of tamales are practices that have been sustained for more than a thousand years. That we still engage in these practices today is a testament to our ancestors and their extraordinary knowledge about food.

Both of us [authors] have grandparents who spoke fondly of finding and preparing quelites (lamb's quarters) and verdolagas (purslane). Quelites comes from the N�huatl word quelitl, meaning edible wild green. Technically, verdologas are also wild green and thus a subset of the larger group of quelites; however, in the US Southwest, our grandparent used the word quelites to refer specifically to lamb's quarters. Verdologas (Portulaca olera-cea) is often said to have originated in North Africa and the Middle East; however, there is considerable archeological evidence of its presence in the Americas before colonization. One type of lamb's quarters (Chenopodium berlandieri) is native to the Americas and closely related to quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa). Another type of lamb's quarters is Chenopodium album, which is native to Europe and Asia. Throughout the world, agribusiness considers both quelites and verdolagas to be weeds and uses herbicides, such as Monsanto's Roundup, to try to kill these nutritious plants.

Global food activist Vandana Shiva critiques the single-minded corporate worldview that favors the eradication of biodiversity and modification of all nature into plantations for profit. She argues, "Not being commercially useful, people's crops [indigenous foods grown in indigenous ways] are treated as `weeds' and destroyed with poisons. The most extreme example of this destruction is that of bathua (Chenopodium album) an important green leafy vegetable, with a very high nutritive value and rich in Vitamin A." This bathua, regarded as a pernicious weed and a threat to commercial wheat crops, is the wild green our grandparents called quelites. Shiva brings attention to the horrific inhumanity of using weed killers on wild crops: "Forty thousand children in India go blind each year for lack of Vitamin A, and herbicides contribute to this tragedy by destroying the freely available sources of Vitamin A [bathua]"...

Real food has, for many of us and in many ways, become unrecognizable as such. Most Americans do not eat a plant-based diet with plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Instead, North Americans consume a lot of sugary, fried, or fake foods like sodas, energy drinks, chips and other bagged snacks, candy bars, and cookies which contain considerable amounts of high fructose corn syrup, sugar and artificial sweeteners, corn and soybean oils, and sodium. The average American eats 156 pounds (seventy-one kg) of added sugar every year. Not only are Americans eating these foods, they are eating more of them: per person we're now eating 750 more calories per day than we consumed thirty years ago. There are multiple factors that influence the dismal eating habits of many Americans. These include lack of access to healthy, fresh foods, which is a particular problem in working-class communities of color; easy access to fast food and junk food; advertising campaigns for sodas, fast food, and junk food that target youth; and agricultural subsidies that make processed and fake foods cheap and accessible.

2321 2322 2323 2324 2325 2326 2327 2328 2329

Unlike immigrant Latinas/os who grew up with ready access to fresh foods grown and produced on small local farms, many US-born Latinas/os have never ever tasted real food. One study on immigrant diets found that Latinas who brought fresh food from street markets in the US reported that the food in their home countries was tastier, fresher, and "more natural." For US Latina/o communities, the Standard American Diet has been imposed through Americanization programs, school lunch programs, targeted advertising campaigns and national food policies. Our communities are now riddled with the diseases of development--diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and some cancers.

2330 2331 2332 2333 2334 2335 2336

While we believe that individuals, families, and communities can take concrete steps to decolonize their diets by reintroducing traditional and ancestral foods, we recognize that a true solution to this problem will entail radical structural changes to the way food is produced, distributed, and consumed both in the US and globally. As we join others in calling for an end to the Standard American Diet of over-processed foods, we also want to challenge the language that frames questions of health and diet as problems related only to individual's "choices." This focus on the individual is especially pronounced in

2337 2338 2339 2340 2341 2342 2343 2344

popular discussions of obesity. Although obesity is classified as a risk factor for diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers, the relationship between weight and disease is quite complex. It is important to keep in mind that there are healthy and unhealthy people in all weight categories: underweight "normal" weight, and overweight. We think the public focus on obesity makes it too easy to demonize individual fat people without seriously engaging with the social policies that are corrupting our food supply and in turn, our health. A cultural obsession with being thin does not help our understanding of what it means to be healthy.

3. What should be done to reclaim and restore sacred lands?

2373 Lesson Steps/Activities:

2374 2375 2376 2377 2378 2379

*Lesson Note: This lesson focuses on the San Francisco Bay Area, but can be adapted to highlight a number of sacred sites that are currently or have been a space of contention. For example, a similar lesson on the Puvungna burial site located at California State University, Long Beach or the Standing Rock Movement, would also introduce students to contemporary debates and struggles regarding the use of sacred lands.

2380 Day 1

2381 2382

1. Begin with a community building activity (5-10 minutes). A sample list of community building activities is provided in the appendix.

2383 2384 2385 2386

2. Engage the class by asking how many students have shopped or visited the movie theater at the Emeryville Bay Street Mall. While students briefly discuss their experiences at Bay Street Mall, project a current image of the mall next to a 1924 image of the Emeryville Shellmound.

2387 2388 2389 2390 2391 2392 2393 2394

3. Explain to the students that the second image depicts what parts of Berkeley and Emeryville looked like prior to development, specifically noting that the Bay Street Mall was constructed atop of one of the largest shellmound sites in the area. Mention that shellmounds often served as burial grounds and sacred sites where Ohlone people would meet for rituals and traditions thousands of years before the formation of the United States. Point out that there was once over 400 shellmounds all around the San Francisco Bay Area, making the region part of the Ohlone people's sacred geography.

2395 2396 2397 2398 2399

4. As a class, read aloud a local news article, "Emeryville: Filmmaker tells story of forgotten Indian burial ground disrupted by quest for retail". After reading the article, screen two short videos, "A New Vision for the West Berkeley Shellmound" and "The Shellmound: Berkeley's Native Monument." Prior to screening the videos remind students to be attentive and take notes.

2400 2401 2402 2403 2404

5. After screening the videos, ask students to define the following terms in their own words: shellmound, monument, sacred geography, burial grounds, development, and repatriation, using context clues from the sources they recently read and watched. After taking five minutes to define the terms on their own, have students talk through each term aloud.

2405 Day 2

2406 2407

1. After reviewing the previous day's discussion, divide the class into four groups and ask them to respond to the following questions:

2408 2409

a. What is the significance of shellmounds and land in the Berkeley/Emeryville area to the Ohlone people?

2410 2411

b. Why are the West Berkeley and Bay Street sites highly sought after by non-Native American groups?

2412 2413

c. How does the struggle for shellmounds intersect with environmental issues in the region?

2414 2415

d. Do you think places where shellmounds are or once stood should be preserved?

2416 2417

e. Are there any sacred or historical sites that members in your community and/or family revere? If so, please share with the group.

2418 2419 2420

2. After allowing the groups to discuss the five reflection questions for fifteen to twenty minutes, provide a few minutes for the class to come together and debrief what was discussed in groups.

2421 Day 3

2422 2423 2424 2425 2426 2427 2428 2429 2430

1. Continue the third day of class by introducing a new assignment. Have students conduct research on both sides (the position of the Ohlone people and those in support of further developing the area) of the Berkeley/Emeryville Shellmound struggle and write a persuasive essay in response to the essential question based on the evidence they have gathered, class discussions, and their own observations and insights. The persuasive essay should be assigned as homework; however, students should be provided ample time in class over the next three days to conduct research, draft an outline and thesis statement, and have their work peer-reviewed.

2431 2432 2433

2. For additional guidance, create a grading rubric for the persuasive essay, compile a brief list of recommended sources, and let students know that their essays must include the following:

2434 2435 2436 2437

a. Your persuasive essay must be five paragraphs (introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion), be typed in 12 point times new roman font, and include a bibliography listing at least four sources (scholarly and credible) in MLA format.

2438 2439

b. Your persuasive essay must have a well-conceived thesis statement that includes your three major talking points/arguments.

2440

c. Each of your talking points/arguments must be supported with evidence.

2441

d. Your essay should be well organized and include rhetorical devices.

2442 2443 2444 2445 2446 2447

3. After a week, students should submit their persuasive essays in class. Provide each student with a 3x5 index card where they are tasked with writing down their three talking points/arguments. After everyone has finished filling out their index card, have students form groups of 3 � 5 students. Group members should take turns sharing their talking points. When all students have shared, they should collectively decide what their three or four strongest points are, create a thesis

Page 116 of 121

2448 2449 2450 2451

statement based on those points, and select one group representative to share their points with the class. Group members should help their representative write a short (two to three-minute) explanation that includes a thesis statement and their key points.

2452 Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:

2453 2454 2455 2456 2457 2458 2459

Chapter 16 of the framework discusses a number of civil rights movements that were created in response to political, economic, and social discrimination. Teachers can build upon the example of the struggle to preserve the shellmound sites and have students compare that to some of the other movements referenced in the framework, such as the 1969�1971 occupation of Alcatraz or the American Indian Movement's 1972�73 standoff at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This lesson can also be connected to the Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement lesson.

2460 Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

2461 2462 2463

� Students will conduct research on Native American sacred lands. They will analyze the positions of both the Ohlone people and developers in the ongoing movement around sacred sites.

2464 2465 2466 2467

� Students will write a five paragraph essay detailing the significance of these sites as well as the social, cultural, and environmental impact of development on and near sacred sites. They will also present their research findings and arguments to the class.
