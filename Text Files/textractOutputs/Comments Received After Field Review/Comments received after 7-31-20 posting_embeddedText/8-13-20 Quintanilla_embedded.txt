From: Blanca Quintanilla Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 11:10 AM To: IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies--support original document
I urge you to reject the CDE recommendation for a reformatted Ethnic Studies. The CDE recommendation is NOT Ethnic Studies!
As a Chicana, a retired K-12 educator, and a participant of the UC Berkeley TWLF student strike for Ethnic Studies in 1969, I am saddened and disappointed that after over 50 years, we are still in the struggle of defending our right to tell our story.
The original Ethnic Studies framework is not only more accurate, it incorporates critical thinking skills, making it more accessible to the teacher. For too many years, as educators, we have had to develop, integrate and implement alternative curriculum on our own. Having a framework created by a team of Ethnic Studies scholars and experts is necessary and overdue.
California's population is comprised of a majority of people of color. The CDE document is whitewashed and cuts out Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans. Apparently, this was done to appease a powerful white lobby. It is time that we change this structure of decision making by a few.
I remind the educators and the people of color who are members of this committee that you are responsible for representing the people focused in the original Ethnic Studies framework. You are there to give credibility to the work done by our scholars, educators and experts on Ethnic Studies. Please consider your role on this committee and know that your community is depending on you to carry their interests forward.
