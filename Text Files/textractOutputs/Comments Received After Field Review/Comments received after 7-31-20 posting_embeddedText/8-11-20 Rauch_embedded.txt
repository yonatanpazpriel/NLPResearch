From: Rauch, James Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 7:46 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Do not drop Arab Americans from CA Ethnic Studies!
To whom it may concern:
I am a Professor of Economics at UCSD and teach a course on the Economics of the Middle East that is centered on the Arab world. Many Arab American students take my course, which is one of very few that touch on their backgrounds in any way.
Arab Americans receive near-zero coverage in California education. This can be remedied by including them in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. There are close to half a million Arab Americans in California. The Arab world gave us Arabic numerals, algebra, the Thousand and One Nights, words like admiral and tariff, and countless other scientific and cultural achievements. Omitting them from Ethnic Studies would be a travesty.
Thank you for your attention.
Sincerely,
James Rauch Professor of Economics UCSD
