Hello, I am a student at San Francisco State University and active member in student organizing. Erasure begins with presenting Arab Americans and Pacific Islanders through an imperialist, orientalist, and overall white frame; which the new draft does to the ethnic groups. Arab Americans need to be discussed beyond September 11, 2001. Palestine needs to be included in the ethnic studies curriculum because Palestine has and is experiencing an ethnic cleansing and not including Palestinians is contributing to it. Palestinians are not controversial, they just exist. We need to maintain the ethnic studies framework of disciplinary knowledge, language, and pedagogy; which makes it so unique. And most importantly, FREE PALESTINE!!
