Greg Grinnell; Concerned citizen; General public comment.
The commission's outline for forced K-12 ethnics studies is ethnocentric and will create racial divide, not inclusion. Enforced identity politics and Intersectionality will lead the way to replacing civic nationalism as America's creed. Education is exposing students to ideas, not to indoctrinate them to your idea of moral clarity.
