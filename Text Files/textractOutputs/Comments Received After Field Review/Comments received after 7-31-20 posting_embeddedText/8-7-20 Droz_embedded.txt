From: Maria Rutenburg Sent: Friday, August 7, 2020 12:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Political Dogma from Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members, The curriculum is deeply flawed. I am an immigrant from Lebanon and my kid is in school. Principles" of the ESMC directly reference and are partly based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and antiIsrael narratives. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting such hateful agendas in the classroom. Regards, Martha Droz
