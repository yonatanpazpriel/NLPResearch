From: jssheff Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 12:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Jeffrey Sheff and I reside in Santa Rosa, CA.
My concern about the draft of the ethnic studies model curriculum is first: that it does not include important ethnic communities in California like the Armenian community and the Persian Jewish and other Middle East and North African Jews.
Although I am from neither of these groups, I wonder whether focusing only on ethnicities which our academic "betters" consider under attack or worthy of attention will give a false impression to young students of the "salad bowl" of immigrants that have made California the state it is.
Thank you for reading this.
