Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I can accept some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am alarmed by the agendized Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns: The committee is highly biased. I know one personally and she is an avowed anti-Semitic propagandist who has come into lots of controversy in the San Mateo School District. I have personally witnessed her vitriolic, hate-filled and biased rhetoric.
It is well-documented that this type of indoctrination creates an UNSAFE environment for our kids. My kids feel completely unable, already, to voice or exhibit their opinions or religious affiliation in public schools. This is completely UNACCETABLE and should not be further institutionalized in the curriculum. It is widely understood how propagandistic movements overtake their inhabited hosts. DON'T BE SUCH FOOLS!
I implore you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns of such grotesquely anti-Semitic vitriol.
Thank you, Douglas Bodin, Taxpayer and public school evangelist
