Hello. My name is Anna Maya, and I am a junior at Bonita Vista High School and I am a proud Jew. As an American-Hispanic female with Arabic and Turkish descent, I am well aware that my ancestry and culture is incredibly diverse, but it is thoughtful education that is needed in California high schools to teach about identities like mine. I've only been in a public high school for a little over two years, and the amount of antisemitism I have seen on campus has been shocking. From degrading jokes, to swastikas engraved on the bathroom stalls, I give the benefit of the doubt to my fellow students for I believe they are not educated sufficiently on the topic. It wasn't until I discovered the release of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft where I was surprised to see little to almost no mention of Jews, let alone LatinX Jews. The idea of this curriculum is undoubtedly necessary; although, some conditions mentioned in the draft do not foster an environment of understanding. The draft should update its curriculum in such a way where Jews may be envisioned with different identities and experiences. The Jewish identity isn't black and white; there are thousands of stories of Jewish immigrants from all over the world including Israel, Central and South America, the Arab world, Iran, the former Soviet Union, and more. Students should be able to develop a deeper understanding in respecting, appreciating, and accepting other ethnicities which would limit involuntary or accidental offense to other ethnicities. In a high school environment, teaching teens about ethnicities now will create a foundation to their own entitled beliefs, and it is crucial to make sure adolescents in this day and age are fully aware and educated on the Jewish ethnicity and culture.
