Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns :
Appears to be biased against Israel and Middle Eastern Jews (ie from Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Morocco etc)
I would like to see an approach of education that is balance, inclusive and non political.
I am a Californian and this is very important to me.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Susan Gould, MD
