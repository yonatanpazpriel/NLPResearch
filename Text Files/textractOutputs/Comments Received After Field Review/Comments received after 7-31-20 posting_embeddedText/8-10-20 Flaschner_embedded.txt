Stop the anti Israel curriculum in your ethnic studies program. As a tax payer all sides of this conflict should be equally studied. Otherwise consider losing any federal tax payer funding because of discrimination. It is extremely unfair of you to present only the Palestinian side of this conflict. Also please do some historical research on this subject and you will find out that the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem who was the head religious leader of the Palestinians met with Hitler to plan the extermination of the Jews in Pre Israel Palestine. There is a photograph of the two of them together. No one is saying that the Palestinians are not indigenous to the area. But the Jews are also indigenous and archeological proof is their to prove it. Josef Flaschner
