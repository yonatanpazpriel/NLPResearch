From: Miriam Bodin Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] why I am opposed to the revision to the ESMC
I have lived in California since 1965 and my children and grandchildren have attended California public schools.
I wrote to the committee yesterday, but I am writing again to emphasize the disappointment my husband and I share about the revision to the ESMC. Many egregious comments have been mostly removed (and rightly so) but there still remain anti-semitic slurs. They are subtle, but they are there. I have a master's degree in American Studies and I have taught American history courses. I know something about the flaws in the United States development as a country, and I also know of all this country has done to correct and modify itself. We are far from perfect, but this ESMC supports a kind of victim mentality for the minority students it is attempting to uplift and to gain respect for their contributions.
And I am appalled by the way this curriculum uses and perpetrates a one-sided political ideology. This is not the correct path for the freedom of thought and speech that we cherish in this society.
Thanks for taking time to read this letter.
