From: Cindy Shamban Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in California Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
My name is Cindy Shamban and as a Jewish resident of California, I am distressed that the inclusion of Arab American Studies has been left out of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. In addition, the decision to not include Pacific Island as originally submitted has shown a lack of respect and ignoring the expertise of the working group.
It is time to reconvene the original committee of experts and writers asked to revise the original ESMC. Scholars and teachers from the Ethnic Studies disciplines are the experts on the curriculum. These Arab American scholars and teachers are experts in the field of Arab American studies. It is important as a part of the Arab American curriculum, there is a section which focuses on Palestine. Palestine and Israel have played a central role in the US relationship supporting of Israel with almost no support of the Palestinians who were massively displaced by the establishment of the state of Israel. It is time to take a clear eyed look at the illegal Occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem and earlier, Gaza. US support has made it possible for the continued oppression of Palestinians by the Israel government.
To support the Palestinian right to self-determination is not anti-semitism which is hatred and discrimination against the Jewish people. The Jewish people are not Israelis. Jews come from many countries in the world who identify as citizens of those countries. The oppression of Jews does not make it right to oppress others.
It is critical to maintain the Ethnic Studies framework based upon disciplinary knowledge, language and pedagogy. Don't undercut or weaken the curriculum by turning Ethnic Studies into multicultural or diversity or area studies.
Thank you for your consideration,
Cindy Shamban
