From: Suzie Abajian Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 2:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] August 13 meeting- Public Comment- Agenda item 2A. 2 and 2A.3
My name is Dr. Suzie Abajian. I am an academic, K-12 educator and an elected member of the South Pasadena School Board. I am commenting on behalf of the Armenian School Board Association composed of elected school board members across California.
We are, and have been from the beginning, strong supporters of the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curiculum but we urge you today to hear the voices of Armenian American Californians and Armenian American scholars and reflect our histories and experiences of refugeehood, racialization, subtractive acculturation, subtractive schooling and marginalization in the United States within the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in a meaningful way-- not a reductionist manner that relegates our experiences to just the Armenian Genocide. The teaching of the history of the Armenian Genocide is important but so is the experiences of racialization and minoritization of Armenians within in the US over the past century. Armenian American Studies is Ethnic Studies like Arab American Studies, West Asian American Studies, etc. Please consult our scholars and include us, as well as other SWANA and MENA groups, in the West Asian American studies, under the Asian American studies portion of the model curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration! Suzie Abajian, Ph.D. South Pasadena Unified School District Governing Board Member Armenian School Board Association
