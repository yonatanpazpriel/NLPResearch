From: Mike Sweeney Sent: Monday, August 31, 2020 7:57 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] 2020 Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
I write in opposition to the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and to the mandate that students at CSU take such a course.
The curriculum is infused with radical left wing ideology that appears designed to indoctrinate students in critical theory. Most citizens oppose this ideology when presented with its beliefs, yet a small minority appears to be foisting it on our young people.
I strongly oppose the mandate. Students can choose to study this radical ideology on their own. And even better would be the diversification of what counts for ethnic studies, such as the study of Jewish, Irish, English, Armenian, Persian, and other ethnicities that comprise our diverse state.
Thank you,
