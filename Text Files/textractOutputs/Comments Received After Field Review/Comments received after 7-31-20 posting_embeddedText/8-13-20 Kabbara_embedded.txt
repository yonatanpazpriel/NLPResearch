Hello,
As a concerned parent, citizen, and community member, I am deeply disturbed about the proposed changes to erase history in our children's education regarding Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the revisions in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. Ethnic studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies Curriculum and pedagogy, not outside sources who are pushing their own narrative to serve their political purposes. Arab-American scholars and teachers are experts on Arab-American curriculum and pedagogy. The same goes for Pacific Islander scholars and teachers. We need to also include communities of color and the Native people throughout the entire model curriculum process, up to ratification. It is your job as educators to educate our children based on FACTS and not narratives that serve special interests and political agendas. You will exercise poor judgment and fail our children if you willingly chose to deceive them and future generations based on false or twisted narratives that fail to teach our children the truth on history, and allow them to come to their own conclusions based on objective facts. The children are our future and hope for creating a better and more just world.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Kindest regards,
