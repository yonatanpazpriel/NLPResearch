From: Joel Denney Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 2:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Americans cannot be excluded from Ethnic Studies.
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
How can you even think of closing an voice for the positive aspects of Arab culture? Worldwide there are so many teaching the aspects of Arab culture that appeal to the worst in people. The only reasons for closing a program that supports moderate, non-violent voices must be bigotry &/o ignorance.
Why would you hand yet another club for the Bad Actors to assault us with and with which to appeal to Arab-Americans?
Really. Why, if not for those (above) reasons.
Don't give in to bigots, powerful though they *are*.
That's not in *our* best interests.
Support what's best for America's interests, not to mention being in the best interest of reducing violence by Islamic fanatics.
I agree with what others are saying: "It's never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.
"The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as "vectors" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students need comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.
"The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes Arab American studies within Asian American studies.
"Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.
"Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students.

"In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
"TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to AYO's findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school."
Respectfully,
Sincerely, Joel Denney
