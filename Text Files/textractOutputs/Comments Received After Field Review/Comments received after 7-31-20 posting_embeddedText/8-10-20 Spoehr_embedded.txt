From: Hardy Spoehr Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 1:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Tavae Samuelu; Hardy Spoehr Subject: [EXTERNAL] Written testimony for IQC meeting
Aloha. We understand that you are receiving testimony in regards to the State of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Thank you for agreeing to listen.
How unfortunate and sad that you have neglected to include one of the faster, if not the fastest, growing population in your state, those proud Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders (NHOPI) who have adopted your state in which to live and raise their families. Too often your state has continued to lump NHOPI together with the obsolete and no longer valid population identifier formerly known as API (Asian Pacific Islander) or AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander). This definition was changed by the federal government in 1997 - more than 23 years ago.
We have attached an information flier prepared by Papa Ola Lokahi, the Native Hawaiian Health Board, a number of years ago which was done in consultation with NHOPI leadership at that time. The flier is as valid today as it was then.
Please enhance your NHOPI curriculum not only for the sake of your NHOPI population but for all of this young California generation and their families.
mahalo,
Hardy Spoehr, President Spoehr Foundation Honolul, Hawai`i
