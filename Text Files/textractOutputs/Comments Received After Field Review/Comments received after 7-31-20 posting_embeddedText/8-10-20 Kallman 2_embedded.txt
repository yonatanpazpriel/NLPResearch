From: Margaret Kallman Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 4:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies; [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Agenda Item 2, Rev ESMCn Public Comments
General Comments on "Systemic and Institutional Racism" Please include in the Revised ESMC these facts:
1. African-Americans and other Under-represented Minorities are in demand, competed for, recruited, promoted � by elite and non-elite universities, by private schools, governments, engineering firms, giant tech companies, financial companies, retailers, think tanks, charitable foundations, etc.
2. Interracial Marriage was illegal, now is commonplace. Mixed-race people now have to decide which box to check on forms for their race � everywhere � government forms, medical forms, etc. White people and People of Color marry and their children may resent the implication that their white parent and grandparents, aunts and uncles, and cousins, Dominate or Oppress anyone.
3. De-stereotype whites as simply "whites" � Be Inclusive of the vast Diversity of whites: French, English, Russian, Welsh, Dutch, Slovak, Polish, Scottish, Czech, Irish, German, Croatian, Romanian, Greek, Italian, Basque, Swiss. There are immigrants and descendants of them all in California.
4. Race, ethnicity are accidents of birth � white children who sit in Ethnic Studies class cannot un-white themselves � they may feel like 2nd-class citizens, or be bullied, for not being Foundational, for being related to Dominant or Oppressor people. Please adjust the language of the ESMC to protect all children from these implications.
Respectfully yours, Margaret Kallman California Resident, Private Individual
