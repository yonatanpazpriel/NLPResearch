Dear California Department of Education,
I taught elementary school in Santa Clara County for 4 years. I applaud your commitment to represent the full spectrum of humanity and Californian/American citizenry.
In the hopes that I am not too late to revoice my opinion in light of the newest draft of the ESMC, I respectfully request that you do not vote to adopt the ESMC as it currently stands. More work needs to be done to correct the religious and ethnic biases embedded in its claims and sources. I believe there are still antisemitic currents running through it and an incomplete/inaccurate portrayal of Jews.
Since the Israeli-Palestinian political conflict is contentious, there must be special care made to provide learners with diverse and multiple sources to understand the facets and history of the issue.
That said, antisemitic language and insinuations should be uncontroversially rejected. This includes using resources that deny the Holocaust. A definition of antisemitism should include sinister stereotyping and double standards held for Jews. Finally, the portrayal of the Jewish community should reflect the diverse ethnic and national identities that comprise it, including Sephardic, North African, and Mizrachi (Middle Eastern) Jews as well as other communities across all continents.
Thank you for your consideration.
Kind regards, Jessica Goldkind -Jessica Goldkind preferred pronouns: she, her, hers title: Ms.
