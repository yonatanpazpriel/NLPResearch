From: Jeffrey Ullman Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:13 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Holly Ullman Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please stop Antisemitism
I understand that there are some changes that take out of the curriculum the most virulent attempts to demonize Jews and Israel. Jews are an ethnic group just like others and deserve to be respected along with others.
Further, there has been an attempt by the antisemites of the left to portray Israel as picking on the Palestinians rather than presenting the true picture, which is 1.5 billion Moslems trying to destroy the tiny Jewish state. Please do not play into their hands by presenting a false view of this conflict.
