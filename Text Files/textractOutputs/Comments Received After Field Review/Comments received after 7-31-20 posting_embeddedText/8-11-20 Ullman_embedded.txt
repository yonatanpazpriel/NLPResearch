From: Holly Ullman Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for REvisions in 2nd draft
I am a California resident and voter.
I thank you very much for your support for the revisions (and deletions) in the second draft of the ethnic studies curriculum regarding references to Jewish and Israeli Americans and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. They reflect your good will and commitment to the standards of community and inclusiveness as stated in AB2016.
The language of the original document would create a highly toxic environment for Jewish students in the public school system. Essentially, it would amount to taxpayer-sponsored harrassment of one group against another ï¿½ particularly egregious since the victims are children and teenagers.
A one-sided view of a foreign political conflict should not be injected into a platform for public education. If there is discussion, it should even-handed. Recently, at UC Santa Cruz, a student resigned from her role in student government because she was hounded and harassed for expressing pro-Israel views. Surely, educators don't want to create a situation like that in a high school classroom.
I hope that you will continue to support the revisions through the review process. Regards, Holly Ullman
