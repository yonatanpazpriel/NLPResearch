From: Megan Mauriello Sent: Sunday, August 2, 2020 7:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not remove Arab Americans from our states curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
Arab-Americans deserve to be included in the Asian-American studies curriculum. ArabAmericans have repeatedly been targeted by our government and by racist individuals and entities, especially post-9/11. In order to fight this bigotry, it is instrumental that we include history of actual Arab-Americans in curricula.
Sincerely, Megan Mauriello
