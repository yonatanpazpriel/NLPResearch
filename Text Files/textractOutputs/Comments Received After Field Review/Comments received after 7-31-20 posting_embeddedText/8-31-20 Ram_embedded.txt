From: Joseph Ram Sent: Monday, August 31, 2020 8:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] a Chosen Christian's Children Learning Ideological Oppression
Hello California Ethnic Studies Board, I have read in some drafts of the "Four I's of Oppression" that "Chosen" is a type of ideological oppression. This verbiage cannot be in the curriculum because it is central to Christian doctrine. My sons cannot learn that being chosen by God, which is a good and beautiful thing, is seen as oppressive by their government. I hope you reconsider using this word, since it has nothing to do with Ethnic oppression: in fact, Christ was trying to implement the opposite, by perfecting the religion by expanding it from just Israel, to the rest of the world.
Respectfully, Joseph Ram Chicano Fresno, Ca
1 Peter 2:9 (in reference to the church, made up of many ethnicities) But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
John 15:16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it to you.
Ephesians 1:3-4 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him.
Matthew 22:14 (spoken by Jesus) For many are called, but few are chosen.
