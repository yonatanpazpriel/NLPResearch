From: Alexandrino, Maria Da Luz C B Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Reinstate Arab and Pacific Islander studies
I am writing to request the reinstatement of Arab and Pacific Islander Studies to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, with the clear inclusion of the Palestinian struggle for the most basic human rights.
We so long and with so much risk fought for ethnic studies encompassing the experiences of oppression of all peoples of color, cannot silently witness the supremacy backlash that usurps our histories, replacing them with an innocuous and bland version of multiculturalism palatable to the powers that are.
In the year of George Floyd martyrdom -- exemplifying the martyrdom of oppressed people around the world - how does this anti-factual position fit the goal of educating for anti-racism?
It comes to mind the question hurled to Senator McCarthy: "Have you no decency, Sir?" This is still the question to be asked of those who attempt to silence the voices and experience of the downtrodden.
Reconsider your position of eliminating Arab and Pacific Islander studies. It is the least you can do to help create a better world.
Africa is beautiful, paz
