Hello, My name is Rachel McCauley. I'm the mother of two students in LAUSD and I live in Canoga Park, CA. I commend the state of California for looking into creating an ethnic studies; however, doing so should not be at the risk of creating further hate for other ethnicities. As a Jewish American, it is extremely important to me that the hardships and struggles due to antisemtism not be disregarded, down played, or further ignited in the new curriculum. Anti-Zionism beliefs that are being included in the curriculum neglect to realize that Zionism and the state of Israel formed due to AntiSemiticism and the needs of Jews to escape persecution in their homelands. It also further disregards that there is a section of Jews, Mizrahi Jews, that actually came from the Middle East. While I am white as well as Jewish, I still have encountered hate during my lifetime and I ask that my children live in a world that is more compassionate and thoughtful. The following writing assignment does more to divide students than bring them together. "Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege." (Page 6, Line 8166-67) Imagine being a high school student that is struggling and then you read this assignment and identify with both populations. My sons won't feel privileged and grateful for the chances that they have because of their ancestry. They will feel targeted and ostracized. Learning about other cultures is important, but it should come at the expense of hurting others. Thank you for taking the time to rethink this curriculum. Sincerely,
