Dear Member of the Instructional Quality Commission:
My name is J Daniel Khazzoom, Emeritus Professor San Jose State University. I am writing about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding and ensure critical thinking. .
I appreciate some improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model but I am concerned by the imposition of an an offensive one-sided political ideology that still remains in the proposed flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Major revisions need to be made to the Ethnic Studies Model to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles to use more precise and inclusive terminology to build bridges of understanding, and ensure critical thinking. and align with the ESMC
Thank you/ J Daniel Khazzoom PhD.
