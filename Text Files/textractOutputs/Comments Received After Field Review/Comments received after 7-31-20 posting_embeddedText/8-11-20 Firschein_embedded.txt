From: Oscar Firschein Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] NEED FOR IMPROVING ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I feel that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) needs improvement.
Here are my major concerns
Add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development Numerous sections of the ESMC need revision to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected". I request that you change the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns by revising the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to meet the ESMC Guidelines,
Thank you,
Oscar Firschein
