To whomever this may concern,
As a black jew, I am so proud to see some steps being taken to implement tolerance, acceptance, and openmindedness into our schools. But as proud as I am to see my African-American heritage being represented in the curriculum, I was disappointed to see how poorly Jews and Israel were represented in the first draft.
Even the LA Times editorial board noticed this issue and wrote about the blatant one sided narratives about Israel and many other issues in the proposed curriculum. Pushing narrow, divisive political viewpoints prevents students from critical thinking and forming their own opinions.
Ethnic studies should study the major groups that have been discriminated against across race, religion, class, sexuality, etc to achieve its goal of increasing tolerance and acceptance of others. If we have to narrow down the curriculum, we must include two of the most oppressed groups in our country: Jews and Muslims. Just at my school, we had two incidents of anti-semitism in the three months before school closed. I like to believe that the students who carved swastikas on a Jewish kid's locker or drew a big swastika on the baseball field were not properly educated about my people and that education could have prevented them from committing those hateful, ignorant mistakes.
So if not in an ethnic studies class, how can we spread awareness about anti-semitism to prevent things like this from happening in the future? I urge you to revise the ESMC to better represent me and all the Jewish students whose stories aren't included right now.
Thank you for reading, Aiden Moseley
