From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 6:59 AM To: IQC <IQC@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As an educator, and a cultural anthropologist who has taught about race and ethnicity (as many other aspects of humanity in this and other cultures), I would make the following comment.
It is explained in detail in the article published in the Times of San Diego.
https://timesofsandiego.com/opinion/2020/08/06/opinioncalifornias-revised-ethnic-studies-curriculum-needs-morerevision/
The bottom line is that a meaningful and honest pedagogy requires inclusiveness and multiple voices across the ideological spectrum. The past ESMC and the current revision is skewed and does an injustice to all the children of California, including the presence of anti-Semitic views and an unbalanced understanding of specific social issues from redlining to immigration to policing and more.
Please require a further revision in line with the inclusive sensibility outlined above.
Sincerely, Joe Nalven, Ph.D., JD Poway, California
