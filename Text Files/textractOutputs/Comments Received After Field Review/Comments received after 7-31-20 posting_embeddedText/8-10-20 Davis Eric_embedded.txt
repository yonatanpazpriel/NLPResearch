From: Eric Davis Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 11:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: assemblymember.berman@assembly.ca.gov Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concerns about ESMC2
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
My name is Eric Davis. I'm the Father of two daughters, and a resident of Assembly District 24.
I'm writing to express my concerns about Draft II of ESMC. Some of the recommended content is surprisingly political and misleading, and it perpetuates dangerous stereotypes.
The "Eight Outcomes of Kï¿½12 Ethnic Studies Teaching" describes goals such as "developing a better understanding of others." However, the California Department of Education has added a UC a-g pre-approved course that harmfully (and inaccurately) stereotypes Jews:
...detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege. They will be asked to think critically about why and who is allowing this evolutionin white identity and how this shift is affecting the identity of Irish and Jewish Americans.
White supremacists would disagree with assigning "white identity" here -- one need only think back to their chant in Charlottesville, 2017, "the Jews will not replace us."
And, it's important to understand that there are Jewish immigrants from all over the world, including the Middle East and North Africa. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews
I respectfully request you make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address concerns such as these.
Thank you,
- Eric
