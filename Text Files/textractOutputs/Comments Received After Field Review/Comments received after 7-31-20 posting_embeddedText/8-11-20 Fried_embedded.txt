I am absolutely apoplectic over this new anti-Semetic curriculum that will be taught in California public high schools. In my lifetime as an American Jew, I never thought that anti-Semitism would be subject approved by the state of California or any state in this great country. Your reprehensible actions of turning our students into "Hitler youth" groups is a total nightmare for everyone. Your lies to impressionable teenagers will indeed be a seed to form more anti-Semitism in the world. God will see the Jewish people through this state sanctioned anti-Semitism as he has done for 2 thousand years. SHAME ON YOU!!
