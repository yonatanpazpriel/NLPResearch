From: Susan Ehrlich Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 5:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Response to your new Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Curriculum Committee:
As a longtime resident taxpayer in Los Angeles, and as a retired University academic whose children attended and graduated from LAUSD schools, I am understandably concerned about the political biases and critical omissions that still exist in your current proposal for an Ethnic Studies Curriculum. While I commend you for the improvements that you made in response to the thousands of critical comments submitted by the public and the scathing critique published by Los Angeles Times last year, I feel that there are still important changes and improvements that I would urge you to undertake. Toward this end, please see my letter that I am attaching to this email.
Thank you for your consideration of these critical issues!
Respectfully, Susan Ehrlich, Ph.D.
