Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns: the misrepresentation of Jews and the imposition of a one sided political ideology, the same problematic principles and ideological framework from which all lessons are developed and the anti-Zionist references in the footnotes, links, and bibliography.
I am a Californian grandparent who is concerned about my grand kids feeling singles out as a Jewish minority not represented fairly under this curriculum.
I ask you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of inter-group understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Efraim Michael Foster City, CA
