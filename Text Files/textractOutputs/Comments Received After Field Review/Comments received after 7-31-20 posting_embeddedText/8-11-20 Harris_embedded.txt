Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am very concerned about the suggested imposition of the revised draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
It is one-sided to the point where we would be better off with starting all over again. You can't fix things with an ill conceived patch. This is such an important issue especially in light of what is transpiring in the US today. Young people are very impressionable. If it is in print it enjoys a certain degree of legitimacy that the spoken word might not. Some teachers, if saddled with the proposed curriculum, will teach it verbatim thinking that is what your esteemed body has studied and approved.
I am sure you have seen examples in the past of despots rising to power by propaganda machines making use of a prejudiced curriculum such as that proposed. It is akin to Covid19 wherein communications from supposedly authoritative doctors and politicians sway public opinion as to not wearing masks. Covid-19 will expand exponentially as will the harm caused by your suggested revision.
I am a California retired person who wishes, when I was younger, I would have spoken up more about issues such as this. I am speaking up for my grandchildren who will not even realize this issue's effects until they are much older.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Barbara Harris
