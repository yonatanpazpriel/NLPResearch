PREFACE FOR THE CURRICULUM ON COMMUNISM
In many ways, the history of the 20th century is the story of communism, starting with the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and ending with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. At the high point of their power, communists controlled one-fifth of the world's population and influenced the course of events on every continent. And yet, the history of communism is an untold story.
The horrors of Nazism and the Holocaust are taught and highlighted in our schools as they should be. But what of communism? Do students know who Karl Marx, Joseph Stalin, and Mao Zedong were? Do they know that communism exacted a death toll of 100 million victims, surpassing that of all the wars of the 20th century? Are they aware there are still five communist regimes in the world today?
Communism: Its Ideology, Its History, and Its Legacy is a supplementary high school lesson curricular resource developed by teachers for teachers. It is offered to help fill the knowledge gap about communism and its enormous impact on world history, past and present.
Written with both social studies and common standards in mind, each of the nine lessons focuses on key individuals and key events in the story of twentieth century communism. A background essay presents essential content, while student-centered activities and numerous assessment options offer a wide variety of opportunities for students to demonstrate their understanding of the global impact of communism. Each lesson features a C3 section, Communism's Contemporary Connection, focusing attention on today's communist nations. All lessons draw upon the extensive resources of the on-line Global Museum on Communism (www.museumoncommunism.org), thus providing multiple opportunities for further research and study.
It is our hope and our goal that the lessons of Communism: Its Ideology, Its History, and Its Legacy will inspire and guide student discussion of such issues as: What are the key tenets of MarxismLeninism? Who was responsible for the outbreak of the Cold War--the Soviet Union or the United States? Why did we fight the Korean War and the Vietnam War? Why did the Berlin Wall fall?
We are pleased to provide teachers like yourself with an educational resource that will help students--the nation's future leaders--study and understand a critical part of the history of the 20th century and draw valuable lessons for the future.

Karl Marx
and His Legacy

OVERVIEW
Perhaps no 19th century figure has had a greater impact on history than the German philosopher and historian, Karl Marx. His "scientific" theory of class warfare and inevitable violent revolution has led, directly and indirectly, to the deaths of over 100 million people, as well as calamitous social, political, and economic change around the globe. A basic understanding of his philosophy and its impact on nations and individuals is a critical component for understanding the world of the 20th and 21st centuries.

OBJECTIVES
Students will: � compare and contrast the views of George
Washington, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Karl Marx on liberty, religion, and property � analyze excerpts from The Communist Manifesto � understand elements of Marxist theory � speculate about life in a Marxist society

BACKGROUND ESSAY
THE LEGACY OF KARL MARX

Have you ever thought about the number of people who have died as a result of war or conflict? Nearly 700,000 individuals perished during the American Civil War. 9 million died in World War I. 10 million people were slaughtered as a result of Nazi genocide under Adolf Hitler. 60 million lost their lives during World War II.
However, none of these totals compare with the number of people who have lost their lives as a result of communism. Between 1917-1991, over 100 million people died as a direct result of communist ideas and actions. This legacy of death has its origins in the writings of a nineteenth century German historian, Karl Marx.
Karl Marx is known as the founder of communism. His 1848 book, The Communist Manifesto, established the basis for the communist philosophy. Few ideas have been as repressive as communism. Believers in Karl Marx have violated the most basic human rights: the right to property and freedoms of press, assembly, speech, movement, and religion.

In the Manifesto, Marx stated, "The theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence: Abolition of private property." He knew that depriving individuals of this most basic freedom would not be easy. Force would be necessary.
Marx understood this. "Of course," he said, "in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads." Therefore, for at least a time, dictatorship would be necessary. Repression is the essence of communism.
Communists pledged themselves to massive redistribution of wealth. However, Marx realized that his views on property were in direct conflict with the current social and political order. Therefore, revolution alone would bring about his desired social changes.
The Manifesto presents specific actions to achieve Marx's goals. Private property would be abolished. A graduated income tax--the more you make, the more you pay--would be instituted. All rights of inheritance would be abolished. The government would control all means of production, all credit and banking systems, and all communication and transportation systems.

Karl Marx

BACKGROUND ESSAY

Marx expected that all nations of the world would eventually follow his ideas and implement his plan. "Workers of the world, unite!" was the closing call to arms in his Manifesto. The

communists had a "world to win." The followers of Marx pursued the goal of revolution worldwide. After Marx, history would never be the same.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. How many people have died as a direct result of communism? 2. What was the key element of Marx's theory of communism? 3. Why did Marx think that revolution was necessary to achieve his goals? 4. Did Marx believe in a right to private property? Do you? Why? 5. C an significant social, political, or economic change occur without violent
revolution? If not, why not? If so, how?

Lenin and the Bolshevik Revolution

OVERVIEW
Vladimir Lenin was the father of the Bolshevik Revolution. His revolution began in October, 1917 and led to nationalization, centralization, collectivization, abolition of property, and restriction of basic freedoms in Russia. These goals were achieved through state-sponsored terror and intimidation. Between 1917-1923, over 200,000 people were executed at the hands of the Bolsheviks. 300,000 more died as a result of execution, imprisonment, and forced relocation to labor camps. Lenin's denial of basic human rights was an integral component of his "dream" of a workers' paradise. His "dream" became a reality under the totalitarian Soviet Union.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
EXTERMINATING HARMFUL INSECTS

V ladimir Lenin was born in 1870. By his early twenties, he was a devoted believer in the ideas of Karl Marx. By 1917, he was the leader of the Bolshevik (Communist) Revolution. By the time of his death in 1924, he was known as the Father of the Soviet Union. Lenin created the Soviet totalitarian system by eliminating basic freedoms, executing his enemies, and promoting global revolution.
Karl Marx had denied the right to private property and called religion "the opiate of the people." Lenin, too, was an atheist. As a teenager, he removed a cross from around his neck and "tossed it in the rubbish bin." As an adult and leader of Bolshevik Russia, Lenin stated, "We do not believe in God."
Lenin and the Bolsheviks did not believe in rights that many others affirmed as natural rights. When they seized power in October 1917, the Bolsheviks began to abolish private property and restrict speech, assembly, and press. Religious belief and practice were also limited. By the end of 1917, restrictions of basic human rights were underway.
Many Russian people opposed this Bolshevik oppression and took up arms against them. From 1918-21, Russia found itself in a bloody and destructive civil war. Seven million men, women, and children perished. The Bolsheviks won the civil war, seized total power, and began to implement

their totalitarian dictatorship. The deaths and destruction had just begun.
Lenin created a secret police force, the Cheka, to eliminate those who opposed him. By 1920, the Cheka had carried out 50,000 executions. By 1923 over half a million people died as a result of execution, imprisonment, and forced relocation to labor camps.
Bolsheviks employed mass terror to remain in power. Lenin wrote countless directives ordering kulaks (wealthy peasants), priests, and other "harmful insects" to be hung or shot.
Martin Latsis, one of the first leaders of the Cheka, carried out these ruthless orders. Bolshevism was driven by class hatred, and Latsis affirmed that the Bolsheviks were in the process of exterminating full classes of human beings:
We are exterminating the bourgeoisie [middle class] as a class. In your investigations don't look for documents and pieces of evidence about what the defendant has done . . . . The first question you should ask him is what class he comes from, what are his roots, his education, his training, and his occupation. These questions define the fate of the accused.
Like Marx, Lenin was committed to the goal of global communism, and launched the Com-

BACKGROUND ESSAY

munist International (Comintern) to achieve that goal. The Comintern was based in Moscow with branches throughout the world. In America, Lenin's supporters formed the American Communist Party in 1919. The world revolution was underway.

The first years of Bolshevik Russia under Lenin (1917-24), were more repressive than any of the centuries under the czars (Russian emperors). When death knocked on Lenin's door in 1924, his chosen successor, Joseph Stalin, was ready to succeed him.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. What is the historical significance of Vladimir Lenin? 2. What were Lenin's goals when he seized power in Russia? 3. What types of people did Lenin want to eliminate? 4. How did Lenin work to make communism international? 5. B riefly describe a society in which private property is abolished and free-
doms such as press, religion, and speech are limited by the government.
6. L enin referred to his opponents as "harmful insects" and his associate,
Latsis, talked about "exterminating" people. What does this language reveal about the attitudes of Lenin and Latsis towards others?

DIRECTIONS:
Choose any one of the following quotes of Vladimir Lenin. Rephrase the statement in your own words and then answer the question below. Use the Vocab App on the back to help you understand the text.
1. The great significance of the proletariat's struggle for equality . . . will be clear if we
correctly interpret it as meaning the abolition of classes.
2. The dictatorship of the proletariat. . . cannot result merely in expansion of democracy.
. . . the dictatorship of the proletariat imposes a series of restrictions on the freedom of the oppressors, the exploiters, the capitalists.
3. We must display determination, endurance, firmness, and unanimity. We must stop at
nothing. Everybody and everything must be used to save the rule of the workers and peasants, to save communism.
4. When one makes a Revolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward --
or go back. He who now talks about the `freedom of the press' goes backward, and halts our headlong course towards Socialism.
5. It is true that liberty is precious; so precious that it must be carefully rationed.

A N AT O LY O V E C H K I N
I am Anatoly Ovechkin, a wealthy peasant from the city of Yekaterinburg. My father was also a kulak (another name for wealthy peasant.) We have been wheat farmers for several generations and own several hundred acres. We have prospered under the rule of the czars. I have a comfortable home in the countryside. I received a basic education in the village school, but my real education has taken place in the countryside, where I have learned how to nurture my plants to make the land most productive. The country would not survive without my wheat, and I would not survive without my land.
BORIS MALKIN
I am known as Father Boris Malkin, a member of the clergy of the Russian Orthodox church. I grew up in a small village outside of Moscow, but the village teacher believed that I had great potential. Through the assistance of several wealthy community members, I was able to go to school and eventually studied theology at one of Russia's great universities. I now work here in Moscow where I minister to both the poor and the wealthy. I feel badly for the poor, and encourage the wealthy to be generous in their charity. Obviously, belief in God is central to my life, just as religion has been central to the life of Russia for centuries.

FYODOR SEMIN
My workers call me Mr. Semin, but you may call me by my nickname, Fedya. I live in Minsk, where I own a factory which manufactures farm equipment. It has not been an easy life for me, but I have worked hard and prospered. I currently employ over 100 people, so you can see that I am making a great contribution to Mother Russia. Some of my workers refer to me as "a member of the bourgeoisie" and say that I am taking advantage of them. Taking advantage?! I am giving them jobs and wages--what more could they ask for? Russia will never become a great nation until she becomes more industrialized. I am helping the country to move along that path.
SERGEI VARLAMOV
Sergei Varlamov is my name, and I am currently in my third year of studies here at the university in Tsaritsyn. As a student of political science, I had the opportunity to read the works of the great German historian, Karl Marx, and I think I agree with much of what he says. The people in my home village suffered a great deal at the hands of their landlords, and the people here in the cities suffer a great deal at the hands of the factory owners. Marx calls those who suffer the proletariat and those who make them suffer, the bourgeoisie. I sometimes have trouble understanding what Marx is trying to say, but I do know that only drastic action will improve the lives of many in Russia.

EKATERINA ROMANOVA
I am Countess Ekaterina Romanova, a distant cousin of the ruling family. Growing up in St. Petersburg, I was educated by private tutors. I had a special talent for painting, so my family sent me to Italy and France to learn more about great art. As a child, I always felt close to the children of the kulaks and peasants on my father's great estate. That is why it is so hard for me to understand why so many people in Russia seem so unhappy today. I know that the world is changing, but does it have to change so quickly? And I pray every day for the Czar, his wife, and his five children. Without Cousin Nicki ruling Russia, what will become of us?
YURI KOZLOV
I am Colonel Yuri Kozlov and was born in the city of Rostov. However, I have not lived there since I was a teenager, for I joined the Imperial Army at the age of 16. I travelled around the empire, from the Black Sea to the Arctic Ocean, in the service of the Czar. My family comes from a people known as the Cossacks, and for generations we have served in the Russian military. My loyalty has been to the Czar, and so I found myself on the losing side of our Civil War. I do not like the Bolsheviks, I do not like how they are trying to change my beloved Russia, and I do not like how they treat those who disagree with them.

OVERVIEW
Joseph Stalin (1879-1953), the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953, employed terror, repression, and execution to maintain his control over the Soviet people. Famine, the worst of which occurred in Ukraine, and executions within the Gulag forcedlabor camps resulted in the deaths of millions of people. His purges in the 1930s decimated the political and military leadership of the country, making the Soviet Union ill-prepared for the Nazi invasion in World WarII. His cruelty was staggering, and his victims numbered tens of millions of Soviet people. In addition, he led a global campaign to "socialize" the world which resulted in the deaths of countless millions world wide.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
THEY WILL SHOOT YOU LIKE A DOG

Joseph Stalin (1879-1953) succeeded Vladimir Lenin as the leader of the Soviet Union. He ruled the Soviet Union with an iron fist for nearly thirty years. Executions, purges, imprisonment, famine, forced relocation, and other methods helped Stalin to stay in power. No government in history, with the exception of Communist China, caused the death of so many of its citizens.
"Death solves all problems," said Stalin. "No man, no problem." Stalin was an efficient problemsolver. Experts estimate that tens of millions people died as a result of his actions in Ukraine; the trials and executions of 1936-1938; and the Gulag, a system of forced labor camps.
Stalin believed in the abolition of private property. Throughout the Soviet Union, he seized agricultural land owned by individuals. Then, he turned these properties into collective (group) farms. Stalin believed that collectivization would improve the nation's overall productivity.
This policy was widely opposed throughout the Soviet Union. Ukraine was a rich agricultural part of the Soviet Union. Many resisted Stalin's collectivization. In retaliation, Stalin increased the quota (required amount) of grain to be produced by 44%. Individuals could only receive grain after the government quota had been met. Ukrainians would have to work harder but would receive less for their efforts. Most of their crops would be sent elsewhere.

Stalin feared Ukrainian opposition both to himself and his policies. He fully supported actions leading to genocide (the elimination of a race or ethnic group.) From 1932-1933, millions of Ukrainians died as a result of the famine Stalin created. Entire communities starved to death. Individuals were imprisoned or executed for taking even a handful of grain from the government warehouses. Soviet officials stopped starving people from travelling to areas where food was available.
Some Ukrainian and other ethnic opposition leaders were sent to the Gulag. This was a system of forced labor camps throughout Russia. Many of them were located in Siberia. There, the harsh climate and the sadistic treatment of the prisoners resulted in millions of deaths. Political dissidents as well as common criminals made up the work force. They built railroads, dams, and hydroelectric plants. They dug for coal, gold, and salt. A prisoner remembered that the guards would "shoot them like dogs" if they challenged their captors.
In 1931, Stalin was asked how long he was going to go on killing people. "As long as necessary," he responded. In the mid-1930s, Stalin began a national campaign to eliminate all opposition to his policies. People could not speak out against his policies for fear of arrest and death. Those who did were arrested and sent to the Gulag.
The years from 1936-1938 are known as the

45 �VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM MEMORIAL FOUNDATION

Stalin

BACKGROUND ESSAY

"Great Terror." Stalin wanted to purge (eliminate) anyone who might challenge him, even former colleagues and advisors. Informants reported, evidence was manufactured, and show trials were held. Confessions were obtained through the use of torture and intimidation. All classes of society were subject to Stalin's excesses. Like thousands of others, a theater director reported, "I incriminated myself in the hope that by telling them lies I could end the ordeal."
By late 1938, opposition to Stalin had been eliminated or silenced. Stalin now turned his attention to international events.
In August 1939, he and Adolf Hitler agreed that their countries would never invade each other. With this guarantee, Hitler invaded Poland one week later, precipitating the start of WWII. In June 1941, Hitler betrayed Stalin and sent his armies into the Soviet Union.
Because Stalin had ordered the execution of many military leaders during the Great Terror,

the Soviet Union struggled to mount an effective defense and lost an estimated 20-30 million men during the war. Stalin was forced to look to the United States and to Great Britain to help him defeat the Nazis.
Stalin believed that "Whoever occupies the territory also imposes on it his own social system as far as his military can reach." By the late 1940s, Stalin forcibly extended Soviet communism throughout Eastern and Central Europe. He did not honor his promise to the Allies to allow free elections throughout Eastern Europe. Instead, Stalin and his men installed puppet governments controlled by the Soviet Union. The communists seized property. They controlled the media. They suppressed religion.
Stalin's actions presented a real threat to Western Europe and the United States. By the time of Stalin's death in 1953, the Cold War was raging. It would last for another 36 years.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. How many people died as a result of Stalin's policies? 2. How did collectivization lead to genocide in Ukraine? 3. Describe life in the Gulag. 4. What was the Great Terror? 5. In your opinion, why did the Ukrainian people oppose collectivization? 6. W hat basic human rights were violated as Stalin purged his enemies? 7. How did Stalin extend communism throughout Europe?

This activity is based upon an actual letter written in 1926 to the highest officials of the Soviet Union. The letter was written by 3 prisoners from the Solovetsky (Solovki) forced labor camp. Read your assigned section (or listen to the other readers), thinking about why these people were imprisoned and how they were treated. On this sheet, circle the 4�5 statements which are most memorable to you
1.We appeal to you, asking you to pay a minimum of attention to our request. 2.We are prisoners who are returning from the Solovki concentration camp because of
our poor health.
3.We went to the camps full of energy and good health, and now we are returning as
invalids, broken and crippled emotionally and physically.
4.We are asking you to draw your attention to your Solovki concentration camp in Kemi
and in all other sections of the concentration camps.
5.It is difficult for a human being even to imagine such terror, tyranny, violence, and
lawlessness.
6.When we went there, we could not conceive of such a horror, and now we, crippled
ourselves, together with several thousands who are still there, appeal to the ruling center of the Soviet state to curb the terror that reigns there.
7.The Security Police, without oversight and due process, sends workers and peasants
there who are, by and large, innocent.
8. People die like flies. They die a slow and painful death. 9.This torment and suffering is placed only on workers who were unfortunate to find
themselves in the period of hunger and destruction accompanying the events of the Revolution.
10.They committed crimes only to save themselves and their families from death by
starvation and they have been punished for these crimes.
11.Now because of their past, for whose crime they have already paid, they are fired from
their jobs.

12.The penniless proletariat dies from hunger, cold, and back-breaking 14-16 hour
days under the tyranny and lawlessness of other inmates who are the agents and collaborators of the Security Police.
13.If you complain or write anything they will frame you for an attempted escape or for
something else, and they will shoot you like a dog.
14.They line us up naked and barefoot at 22 degrees below zero and keep us outside for
up to an hour.
15.It is possible, that you might think that it is our imagination, but we swear to you all, by
everything that is sacred to us, that this is only one small part of the nightmarish truth.
16.We repeat, and will repeat 100 times, that yes, indeed there are some guilty people, but
the majority suffer innocently.
17.The word law, according to the life of the concentration camps, does not exist. 18.What does exist is only the autocratic power of petty tyrants--other prisoners serving
time and working with our jailers--who have power over life and death.
19.Everything described is the truth and we, ourselves, are close to the grave, after 3 years
in Solovki, in Kemi, and other camps.
20.We are asking you to improve the pathetic, tortured existence of those who are there,
who suffer under the yoke of the Security Police's tyranny, violence, and complete lawlessness.

OVERVIEW
The year 1949 greatly increased already mushrooming fears about global communism. First, the Soviets detonated an atomic bomb, a successful test that few had anticipated would come quite so quickly. The other shock occurred in October when the world's most populous nation, China, became communist. Mao Zedong and the Red Army finally defeated Chiang Kai-Shek and the Nationalists, ending a civil war that had been waged off and on since the late 1920s. Mao's victory had a tremendous impact on the people of China as well as millions of others throughout Asia.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
PARENTS MAY LOVE ME, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS CHAIRMAN MAO

Imagine being forced to turn your parents in to the police because they criticized the president. Imagine being denied a high school education. Imagine being taken from your family and being forced to work on a farm thousands of miles from home. Imagine that no matter how hard you worked, you would never earn more than someone who didn't work at all.
These are not just imaginary situations--all occurred in China during the rule of Mao Zedong. Under Mao (1893-1976), China became a communist nation. In 1949, Mao and his forces finally defeated his opposition after a conflict lasting twenty years. This victory had tremendous consequences for the Chinese people. An entire nation and its people were transformed. Basic liberties such as press, speech, and religion were denied. Private possessions were eliminated-- from clothes and hygiene products to pots and pans. The group was more important than the individual.
Mao's government transformed society. 60-70 million people perished within the first four decades of communist China's existence. They died from purges, forced labor, and starvation. This tragedy happened primarily under Mao's Great Leap Forward (1959-1961) and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976).

A major goal of the Great Leap Forward was to increase agricultural production. Private lands were seized by the government and turned into collective (communal) farms. Peasants and wealthy landowners were forced to work on these farms. Individuals received only meager amounts of food for their efforts. Many people scavenged the fields during the day, looking for seeds, frogs, insects--anything to eat. The result was widespread famine. This famine was not caused by weather or natural disaster. This famine was a direct consequence of political decisions.
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (GPCR) was a social, political, and economic movement. Its goal was to rejuvenate the revolutionary ideas of socialism. Private property, economic opportunity, and individual liberty were forcibly suppressed throughout China. Millions of people died. Millions more suffered terribly.
One of the specific goals of the GPCR was to eliminate the "Four Olds": old customs, old culture, old habits, and old ideas. Groups of high school and college students, known as the Red Guards, took this message to heart. They went throughout the country and destroyed ancient buildings and priceless antiques. They encouraged young people to publicly criticize their parents and teachers.

BACKGROUND ESSAY

They humiliated and sometimes executed wealthy peasants, landowners, and educated individuals.
Education came to almost a complete stop during the GPCR. Universities did not hold exams. Teachers and professors were sent into the fields to participate in "re-education" programs. Young people from the cities were forced to leave school to live in the country.
At the center of this upheaval was Mao Zedong. Parades and propaganda helped him to control society. A little red book, Quotations from Chairman Mao, was required reading for all. Elementary school students were taught to say, "Parents may love me, but not as much as Chairman Mao."
Mao's policy was based upon the writings of Karl Marx and Lenin. They believed that the

factory workers of the world would unite in violent revolution to overthrow factory owners. Mao applied these beliefs to the agrarian society of China. He encouraged landless peasants to take up arms against the landowners and elite of society.
Mao also supported the efforts of other revolutionary movements throughout Asia. Only one year after Mao came to power, North Korea invaded South Korea to try to make all of Korea communist. Communist movements in Vietnam and Cambodia received significant financial and military support from Mao.
China today has improved economically from the Mao years. However, the country is still not free politically. The leadership of the Communist Party is unchallenged. The government continues to restrict basic civil liberties. Mao's legacy lives on.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. What were Mao's two major initiatives? How successful were they? 2. Was collectivization successful? Why or why not? 3. How did the Red Guards try to eliminate the "Four Olds"? 4. If you had lived during the GPCR, would you have joined the Red Guards?
Why or why not?
5. How did Mao's view of communism differ from that of Marx and Lenin? 6. What long-term impact did Mao Zedong have on China and parts of Asia? 7. Why did Mao eliminate personal liberty to achieve his goals?

and North Korea

OVERVIEW
In June 1950, war erupted on the Korean peninsula. Ultimately, the country was divided into two: a communist state in the northern half and a free state in the southern half. South Korea struggled but put itself on the road to political and economic success, thanks in large part to the United States, which prevented its seizure by the communists in the Korean War. In contrast, North Korea became increasingly isolated from the rest of the world, first under Kim Il-Sung (who ruled from 1948-1994) and then under his son, Kim Jong-Il (1994-2011). The two Kims ruled North Korea--which calls itself the Democratic People's Republic of Korea-- for over 60 years, aided in large part by the intentional development of a cult of personality at the expense of freedom, prosperity, and individuality.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
THANK YOU, FATHER KIM IL-SUNG

Following World War II, the Korean peninsula was divided into two countries: a democratic republic in the South and a communist dictatorship in the North. The totalitarian regime in the North began under Kim Il-Sung (who ruled from 1948-1994) and was continued by his son, Kim Jong-Il (1994-2011). The two Kims ruled North Korea for over 60 years.
Two years after coming to power, Kim Il-Sung sent North Korean forces across the 38th Parallel, the dividing line between North and South Korea. This invasion launched the KoreanWar (June 1950July 1953.) Fearful of the spread of communism, the United Nations, led by the United States, supported the forces of South Korea. Nearly 36,000 American soldiers and over 58,000 South Korean soldiers died fighting the forces of Kim Il-Sung and his Chinese ally, Mao Zedong. Civilian casualties numbered in the millions. When hostilities ended, the country remained divided by the 38th Parallel, and Kim remained the leader of North Korea.
North Korea's leaders have elevated themselves to god-like status. They demand near-worship from the North Korean people. There are over 500 statues of Kim Il-Sung throughout North Korea. Newlyweds traditionally go to the nearest statue to lay flowers at his feet. His picture hangs in every household. Families can be fined for not taking good care of his photo. Although he died in 1994, Kim Il-Sung is known as the "Eternal Leader" of North Korea.

Every North Korean attends weekly class at the local Kim Il-Sung Institute of Revolutionary Ideas to study juche. This philosophy emphasizes national self-reliance and pride. Compared to the worth of the entire nation, the individual has little value.
Juche dominates the annual Arirang spectacle. In a series of performances in a huge stadium, as many as 20,000 individuals flip colored cards to create gigantic images: the North Korean flag; farmers at work; a portrait of Kim Jong-Il. The individual cards disappear as the awe-inspiring national images appear.
The birthdays of North Korea's "Dear Leader" (Kim Jong-Il) and "Beloved Leader" (Kim Il-Sung) are days of celebration. Each February, the birthday of Kim Jong-Il is a national holiday. Parades, floats, and songs all glorify him. One of the floats includes a double rainbow and star. This represents the belief that a double rainbow and new star appeared in the sky at the moment of Kim's birth. Many North Koreans reportedly believe that Kim Jong-Il could control the weather.
Both Kims worked hard to appear as saviors of the Korean people. This strong focus on an individual as the complete embodiment of a nation's values and ideals is known as a cult of personality. The Koreans completely identify the Kims with the North Korean communist way of life. They have created a cult of personality.

68 COMMUNISM: ITS IDEOLOGY, ITS HISTORY, AND ITS LEGACY

Kim II-Sung

BACKGROUND ESSAY

Children in North Korea are taught that the Kims are "perfect" human beings who will create a paradise in North Korea. When something good happens, people say, "Thank you, Father Kim IlSung."
The North Korean people are taught to be devoted to their leaders. This loyalty is reflected in the lyrics to a popular patriotic song, No Motherland Without You.
You pushed away the severe storm. You made us believe, Comrade Kim Jong-Il.
We cannot live without you. Our country cannot exist without you! Our future and hope depend on you. People's fate depends on you, Comrade Kim Jong-Il!
We cannot live without you. Our country cannot exist without you!

Any challenge to the leadership is considered a challenge to the North Korean way of life. Organized religion has been abolished. Freedom of expression does not exist. Political prisoners and their families are sent to Camp 22, a North Korean concentration camp currently holding over 50,000 people.
Huge sums of money are devoted to maintaining the cult of personality while the nation suffers. From 1995-98, 2-3 million died as a result of a national famine. Cycles of flooding and drought contributed to this tragedy. The inefficient policies of the state-controlled economy laid the foundation for this disaster.
Kim Jong-Il died in December, 2011. His son, Kim Jong-Un, suceeded his father. He is known as the "Great Successor."

THINK ABOUT IT
1. Who are the only leaders who have ever ruled communist North
Korea? What years did they govern? What are their nicknames?
2. Why did the United States support South Korea during the Korean War? 3. According to the philosophy of juche, which is more important,
the individual or the group?
4. What is a cult of personality? 5. How does the North Korean government treat people who disagree
with any of its policies?
6. How does the North Korean government violate individual freedom
of religion?

BACKGROUND ESSAY
T O K E E P Y O U I S N O B E N E F I T, T O DESTROY YOU IS NO LOSS

He was described as "a lovely child." Pol Pot, the future leader of Cambodia, was born in the late 1920s into a large and comfortable family. He studied at a Buddhist pagoda in the capital city, Phnom Penh. Pot did so well academically that he earned a college scholarship to study "radio electricity" in Paris.
Once in Paris, young Pol Pot became a committed communist. His closest friends were also Cambodian communists who, many years later, helped him to organize the "Red Khmers" (Khmer Rouge.)
Pol Pot left Paris to return to Cambodia in the early 1950s. When Cambodia gained its independence from France, Pol Pot and his Marxist colleagues helped establish the Communist Party in Cambodia. By 1975, he and the Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia.
Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge quickly began their attack on the most basic civil liberties. He began by changing the calendar. The year 1975 was rechristened the Year Zero.
In order to bring about the revolutionary changes sought by Pol Pot, the cities and urban areas were immediately evacuated. Phnom Penh became a ghost town. City-dwellers were forcibly relocated into rural areas. In the countryside, their entire lives were regimented. All private property was eliminated. Children were raised collectively. Meals were eaten and prepared communally.

Individuals were re-classified as either fullrights people or "depositees". These were people who had been "deposited" from the cities into the countryside. They were marked for execution. According to a Khmer Rouge slogan, "To keep you is no benefit, to destroy you is no loss."
Pol Pot and his Khmer Rouge quickly focused their energies on the elimination of entire classes and professions. The educated were targeted, and doctors and lawyers were shot. Anyone who had connections with the former government or with foreigners was also executed.
Religion was despised. The vast majority of the Cambodian population was Buddhist. At the start of the Khmer Rouge's purge (elimination), more than 80,000 monks lived in the country. These monks were forced to marry and renounce their vows of faith--or face execution. As many as 40,000-60,000 monks were executed. Pol Pot's soldiers were also responsible for mass executions of Muslims and Christians.
Various ethnic groups within Cambodia were also targeted. Nearly all Vietnamese living in Cambodia were forced back to their homeland. Half of the Chinese population (over 225,000 individuals) was eliminated. Ethnic Thais and Laotians living in Cambodia were also executed.
Those set for execution were sent to one of nearly 200 prisons such as Choeung Ek, Tuol Sleng,

and S-21. To save ammunition, prisoners were often poisoned, buried alive, impaled on bamboo sticks, or bashed against trees. The Khmer Rouge was efficient and required prisoners to dig their own graves. These mass graves became known as "killing fields."
From 1975-79, Pol Pot's governing Khmer Rouge was responsible for killing approximately 2 million Cambodians--20%-25% of the population. Yet, the human faces behind the statistics tell an even grimmer story.
"My wife held the youngest of our sons in her arms," recalls one survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. "I held the hands of the other two. Our elbows were then tied. We were blindfolded and I knew we were about to be executed. I was able to untie myself and lift my blindfold. The Khmer Rouge were stuffing the mouths of those they were

leading with rags and grass to prevent them from screaming and were cutting their throats like animals--the throats of men, women, old folk, and children alike."
State-supported starvation contributed to the genocide. Bo Meng, a restaurant owner in Pittsburgh, recalls how single spoonfuls of corn kernels served as family meals. Another survivor, Loung Ung, in her memoir, First They Killed My Father, tells of how her older siblings shook the trees at night "hoping to find June bugs" to eat, while she and her younger brothers and sisters scoured the ground to catch frogs and grasshoppers for nourishment.
In early 1979, Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were driven from power by the Vietnamese. Pol Pot lived in exile for the next twenty years. He died the night before he was to appear before a war crimes tribunal.

NOTE:
In 1997, almost 20 years after the Khmer Rouge's crimes, the Cambodian government wrote to the United Nations requesting a trial against the Party's senior leaders for war crimes, international crimes, human rights violations, and genocide. The main purpose of the request was to provide justice to the Khmer Rouge's victims. Funded by more than 35 states, the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia (ECCC) were established in 2005, becoming fully operational in 2007. Included among those being tried by the ECCC: Kang Kek Iew, head of Internal Security under the Khmer Rouge and manager of the Cambodian prison camps. Iew was found guilty of crimes against humanity and was sentenced to life in prison in 2012. Nuon Chea, Pol Pot's right hand man, received a life sentence for crimes against humanity in 2014 and still awaits a separate trial for charges of genocide. Ieng Sary, former Deputy Prime minister of Foreign affairs, and his wife Ieng Thirith were accused of planning, ordering, and overseeing the crimes of the Khmer Rouge. However, he died before he could be tried, and his wife was declared mentally unfit to stand trial. Khieu Samphan, former Head of State and Pol Pot's successor, received a life sentence for crimes against humanity on August 2014.

OVERVIEW
Communism was brought to Latin America by two revolutionaries: Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Castro and Che promised democracy. Instead, they created a totalitarian communist dictatorship and the most militarized and repressive nation in the Western Hemisphere. The Cuban Missile Crisis, which could have led to nuclear war, was a direct result of Castro's symbiotic relationship with the communists of the Soviet Union. An estimated 15,000-18,000 Cubans have been directly killed by the Castro government, and some 100,000 have fled the regime. Cuba's communist philosophy, coupled with its geographic proximity to the United States, continues to have an impact on American domestic and foreign policy, as well as on the lives of millions throughout Latin America.

WE MUST PROCEED ALONG THE PATH OF LIBERATION

Communism was on the march after World War II, moving from Eastern Europe to Asia to Africa. However, it did not arrive in the Western Hemisphere until 1959 and was brought by two young revolutionaries: Fidel Castro and Che Guevara. Castro was a former law student who wanted to transform Cuba into a communist nation. Che was a former medical student who was committed to the global spread of communism.
Two years earlier, Castro and Che were fighting a guerrilla war to depose Cuba's authoritarian ruler. Castro was known for his ability to inspire others while Che was feared for his ruthlessness. Defectors and deserters were shot. Peasants who opposed the communists had their homes and crops burned. Che himself ordered the execution of nearly 150 Cubans who opposed his goals.
Since Cuba was only 90 miles away from the United States, Americans were very interested in Castro's opinion about democracy and communism. He stated, "We are fighting for a democratic Cuba and an end to dictatorship." He said he desired a "free, democratic Cuba."
Castro came to power in January 1959 and

visited the United States. He again promised that freedom and democracy were his "ideals" for Cuba. He assured the world that democratic elections would soon follow.
Fidel Castro never held those elections. He never implemented a democracy. He created a totalitarian dictatorship during fifty years of repressive rule.
The repression in Cuba was widespread and comprehensive. Rights to property, speech, press, assembly, and religion were all limited, and remain so today. Show trials and purges eliminated Castro's enemies. A prison camp system was constructed for those who disagreed with the Castro regime. Imprisoned "enemies of the state" included poets and priests, journalists and nuns, democracy activists, and gays. Even Christmas was banned in this formerly devout Roman Catholic country.
Castro embraced Soviet dictator Nikita Khrushchev. The Soviets placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. As a result, the world was brought to the edge of nuclear war when the United States challenged this situation in October 1962. War was avoided through the leadership of President

BACKGROUND ESSAY

John F. Kennedy and Khrushchev's decision to remove the Soviet missiles from Cuba. The world later learned that both Castro and Che wanted the Soviets to fire the nuclear missiles. According to Castro, "we must proceed along the path of liberation even if this costs millions of atomic victims." He and Che believed that a nuclear holocaust would pave the way for the ultimate triumph of communism.
Since the 1962 missile crisis, the United States government has pressured Cuba to restore the freedoms of its citizens. Trade with Cuba is severely limited. Travel to Cuba--even by American citizens with family members in Cuba-- is greatly restricted. Some humanitarian aid such as food and medical supplies has been sent to Cuba by private organizations, but not the U.S. government.
Castro decimated the Cuban economy and blamed American policies for his problems. However, Cuba has been able to trade with every other country around the world and Castro has improved health care and education throughout the country.
Cuba became the Soviet Union's closest ally in Latin America, and Castro's state was a leading supporter of communism around the world. Che, Castro's chief advisor, left Cuba in 1965 to train and support communist guerilla movements in Africa and Bolivia. He described his African experience as "a history of failure." In Bolivia, he was unable to attract local support for his

ideology, and was executed by government forces. Though Che Guevara died in 1967, Cuban
communism continues to have an impact throughout Latin America. Bolivia's president, Evo Morales, redistributed land and nationalized key industries, expressing his belief that "he [Che] inspires us to continue fighting, changing not only Bolivia, but all of Latin America and the world." Morales' close ally, the late President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, believed that Che Guevara is the "infinite revolutionary" and thought of Castro "as a father." Chavez redistributed land, nationalized industries, and limited freedom of expression in order to radically transform Venezuelan society. For three decades, the Peruvian communist movement, Shining Path, waged guerrilla warfare throughout the country, killing 25-35,000 Peruvians. Nicaragua's president, Daniel Ortega, who trained in Cuba to lead guerilla warfare, became a leader of the Sandinistas, a revolutionary movement that overthrew the government in 1979 and began a process of land redistribution and nationalization of industry. Since 2007, however, Ortega has adopted a policy of democratic socialism.
Castro, the political inspiration for all of these Latin American leaders, did not change his views about communism, even as the Soviet Union began reforming in the late 1980s. He recommitted his country to strict Marxist teaching. His government cracked down on private garden plots and farmers' markets. Castro

continued his banishment of private property. Major economic decisions were still made by the government. In recent years, however, limited free enterprise has been permitted, restrictions have been loosened, and religion is more tolerated.
An estimated15,000-18,000 Cubans were killed by the Castro government. Over the past thirty years, nearly 100,000 Cubans have tried to escape to Florida across a treacherous, shark-infested 70-mile channel in leaky and home-made boats.

Often, military helicopters have flown overhead and dropped sandbags upon the refugees. An untold number of people drowned as they were swimming for liberty.
Castro turned over the running of the country to his brother, Raul, in 2008. Yet, his legacy of oppression continues. Countless Cubans have gone to their graves waiting for the "free, democratic Cuba" Castro promised over a half century ago.

Germany and the Berlin Wall

OVERVIEW
The Berlin Wall was one of the only walls in history built to keep people in--not out. Constructed in 1961, the wall physically divided Berlin into East and West for the next twentyeight years. This tangible expression of communist repression restricted a basic human liberty: the liberty of movement. Less than three years after President Ronald Reagan called upon Mikhail Gorbachev to "Tear down this wall!" the edifice collapsed. East and West Berlin were united, and the Cold War was on its way to a peaceful resolution.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL!

On the morning of August 13, 1961 the people of Berlin, Germany awoke to the sounds of hammers. A wall was under construction in their city; a wall which would physically divide Berlin into East and West for the next twenty-eight years. This tangible symbol of communist repression was known as the Berlin Wall. Made of reinforced concrete and barbed wire, it was patrolled 24/7 by secret police with automatic weapons turned on their own citizenry.
The Berlin Wall reflected a communist violation of a basic human liberty: the freedom to travel. Limitations on freedom of movement had been enforced since the end of World War II (1945). The Soviet Union occupied East Germany, turning it into a satellite communist nation. The city of Berlin, located within East Germany, was divided into a free West and a communist East. Freedom to travel between East and West was severely restricted.
In 1948, the Soviet Union blocked the movement of food and fuel into West Berlin. The aim of this blockade was to isolate West Berliners from freedom. In response, the United States and other Western nations launched the Berlin Airlift, sending in over 200,000 flights in one year in order to supply the West Berliners with basic necessities. After a year, the blockade was lifted and the Soviets acknowledged the freedom of West Berlin.
With the formation of the GDR (German

Democratic Republic) in 1949, communism ruled in East Germany. Private property was limited. Agriculture was collectivized. Free speech was suppressed, and demonstrators were arrested. Border controls were tightened. Still, over the next twelve years, millions exercised their right to travel and fled to West Germany in search of freedom.
The city of Berlin remained divided in two: East Berlin was part of the GDR and West Berlin was part of the free Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). Many of those escaping from East Germany escaped through East Berlin into West Berlin. In 1961, the wall immediately ended that flow of humanity.
The decision to build a wall was made by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and East German communist leader Walter Ulbricht early in August 1961. By Sunday morning, August 13, construction was underway. 200 kilometers (124 miles) of cement and barbed wire divided the German people. This physical barrier -- completed days later -- denied East Germans the freedom to travel outside their home except for specific cases approved by the government. Onlookers wept as the authorities cemented the "captive" status of those living under communism.
From 1961 until the fall of the wall in 1989, hundreds still tried to exercise their right of travel and sought to escape. They dug tunnels, flew balloons, slid along aerial wires, and even drove

103 �VICTIMS OF COMMUNISM MEMORIAL FOUNDATION

BACKGROUND ESSAY

full-speed through fortifications in armored cars. Some escaped through the sewer system; others bled to death after being shot.
East German border guards did not hesitate to shoot those who attempted to flee, killing hundreds of their own citizens. The authorities held the guards accountable by keeping gravel raked neatly each evening. If the guards permitted people to escape, the gravel would show fresh footprints and the guards would be jailed. This was the only wall in all of history patrolled by guards who pointed their guns inside, upon their own unarmed citizens.
In June 1987, President Ronald Reagan went to Berlin and called upon Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to "Tear down this wall!" Reagan understood that since East Germany was under Soviet influence, only Gorbachev possessed the

power to remove the wall. Reagan reminded the world that if Gorbachev really believed in freedom, he should prove it by destroying this obvious symbol of repression. Gorbachev initially refused Reagan's plea. He feared a reunified Germany.
Freedom-lovers everywhere got their wish on November 9, 1989. East Germans themselves scaled the wall with hammers and champagne glasses. The communist authorities did not stop their celebration. The Soviet Red Army was not sent in to silence the chorus of liberty. East and West Berliners could now travel freely throughout the city.
In February 1989 the East German dictator Erich Honecker predicted the wall would remain for another 100 years. It fell nine months later. The fall of the Berlin Wall was a telling sign that the Cold War was coming to a close--peacefully.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. Why did the Soviet Union impose a blockade on West Berlin? How did
the United States and other nations respond?
2. How and why did the Soviet Union limit freedom of travel in East Germany
(GDR) after 1949?
3. Why was the Berlin Wall constructed? How did people react to this limita-
tion of their ability to travel?
4. What role did Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev play in bringing
about the fall of the Berlin Wall?
5. In your opinion, under what circumstances would a country be justified in
creating a physical wall to limit people's ability to travel?

OVERVIEW
American involvement in Vietnam can be traced to the Truman administration. High-level involvement began in 1961 with President John F. Kennedy, who sent military advisers to South Vietnam, troops to provide training, combat support, and a massive infusion of new weapons. By 1975, over 58,000 Americans had died in Vietnam; thousands were missing in action; tens of thousands were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder; and the American people had experienced tremendous social and political upheaval caused, in part, by American involvement in Vietnam.

Edward Holmes Martin, a U.S. admiral, was

only one of tens of thousands of Americans

who suffered at the hands of the communist

Vietnamese forces. Prisoners of war, like Admiral

Martin; those who lost their lives in combat; the

veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress

disorder (PTSD); and the American people

themselves all suffered as a result of communist

expansion in Vietnam.

Significant American involvement in Vietnam

began under President John F. Kennedy in 1961.

His goal was to stop a communist takeover that

could be part of a wider "domino effect" with

nations throughout Southeast Asia becoming

communist. China and North Korea had already

fallen to communism. Presidents from Kennedy

through Richard Nixon (1961-1974) feared that

communism might spread to Laos, Cambodia,

and Thailand. Americans were concerned these

countries might become Soviet allies.

The Soviet Union assisted North Vietnam

militarily and politically. It argued that the

Vietnam conflict was a nationalist uprising of the Vietnamese people against western domination and not a serious communist threat to American interests. American military and political leaders disagreed.
Under Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, American involvement increased significantly. By the end of his administration, America was in a full-scale war in Vietnam.
During the war, over 800 Americans were captured as prisoners of war and detained in prison camps throughout North Vietnam. Insectinfested rations, physical and psychological torture, and isolation were among the techniques used by the Vietnamese to persuade the prisoners to divulge military information.
Admiral Martin recalled, "I was there in the famous Hanoi Hilton in a section that we called Heartbreak Hotel. There was slime and mold on concrete beds, with leg irons at the end of them. The room was about 76 inches long and 56 wide. From time to time they moved us to different rooms. One time . . . there were two of us in a room with only enough room for one to sleep in."
Another POW, Henry P. Fowler, Jr. described similar conditions: "The cell we lived in was a solid concrete room either without a window, or a window boarded up. Measured 7 ft. wide, 9 ft. long and 10 to 20 ft. high, about like your

bathroom. For the first 3 years, that was my home 23 hours and 45 minutes a day, for 3 solid years. We never saw a toilet. We had a little black bucket in the corner of each room. We never saw a bed. We either slept on wooden boards or on the cement.We never saw hot water and we never saw shoes."
The effect of the war on America domestically was tumultuous. As American casualties increased, the nation's universities erupted. What began as educational "teach-ins" in 1965 became campus takeovers by 1968. The country's streets and campuses saw unprecedented unrest. Opposition to the Vietnam War reached a fever pitch. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators protested at military facilities, in front of government buildings, and on college campuses.
Protestors in the United States were in favor of peace, though many were unaware of the international involvement and dimensions of the war. Others were frustrated by the mismanagement of the war and the tremendous loss of life with no clear victory in sight. Protestors marched outside the White House shouting "Hey, hey, LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"
Returning veterans were often ignored or vilified. Many were suffering from PTSD (PostTraumatic Stress Disorder) as a result of their Vietnam service. PTSD occurs as a result of having seen or experienced life-threatening experiences. Its symptoms include flashbacks, insomnia, nightmares, and difficulty forming relationships. Approximately 30% of all Vietnam veterans suffered from PTSD at some point in their lives. Their lives were irrevocably changed by their service in Vietnam.

President Johnson declined to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency in 1968. The Republican nominee, Richard Nixon, won the presidency. He pursued a policy to end the war. In January 1973, the Paris Peace Treaty was signed, though fighting continued. In April 1975, Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese. Soon after, neighboring countries Laos and Cambodia also fell to communism, in part validating the "domino effect."
Over 58,000 American soldiers, sailors, and airmen died in the Vietnam War. 153,000 individuals were hospitalized as a result of their wounds. Nearly 800 men were captured as prisoners of war, and over 1,700 individuals are still considered Missing in Action (MIA). Even today, some American foreign policy decisions are influenced by the military and diplomatic experiences in Vietnam.
President Ronald Reagan remembered victims of the Vietnam War in his January 1989 "Farewell Address." He told a story, paying tribute to what America had tried to stop in Vietnam. Said Reagan:
I've been reflecting on what the past eight years have meant and mean. And the image that comes to mind like a refrain is a nautical one--a small story about a big ship, and a refugee, and a sailor. It was back in the early `80s, at the height of the boat people. And the sailor was hard at work on the carrier Midway, which was patrolling the South China Sea. The sailor, like most American servicemen, was young, smart, and fiercely observant. The crew spied on the horizon a leaky little boat. And crammed inside were refugees from

BACKGROUND ESSAY

Indochina hoping to get to America. The Midway sent a small launch to bring them to the ship and safety. As the refugees made their way through the choppy seas, one spied the sailor on deck, and stood up, and called out to him. He yelled, "Hello, American sailor. Hello, freedom man!"

During the Vietnam War, America had tried to play that role: freedom man. The war failed to achieve that objective. Divisions at home were often as bitter and stark as the divisions in Vietnam itself. It was a war that left numerous Americans as well as Vietnamese dead, maimed, and scarred.

THINK ABOUT IT
1. Describe the living conditions of American POW's. 2. Why did the United States become involved in Vietnam? 3. In addition to the prisoners of war, which other Americans suffered as a
result of the Vietnam War? How did they suffer?
4. What long-term impacts did the Vietnam War have on American politics
and the American people?
5. Why had America tried to be "freedom man"? In your opinion, is that
an appropriate role for the United States?

and the End of
the Cold War

OVERVIEW
Following World War II, Europe was the focal point for the conflict between communism and freedom. For half a century, nearly all of Eastern and Central Europe suffered under communist rule. However, beginning in Poland in the 1980's and sweeping across the Soviet bloc, nationalistic and anti-communist movements flourished. Relying upon strikes, demonstrations, and even songfests, the peoples of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania asserted their rights, liberated themselves, and peacefully went about the task of creating new governments, thereby ending the longest-running ideological conflict of the twentieth century.

BACKGROUND ESSAY
MAY GOD WATCH OVER YOU, MY PRECIOUS FATHERLAND

In July 2013, President Barack Obama issued a proclamation in honor of Captive Nations Week. This commemoration was first celebrated in 1959 "amidst an escalating Cold War, affirming America's support for the individual liberties of those living under Communist oppression." The nations of Eastern Europe were held captive by the ideology of the Soviet Union for over fifty years. Nearly 100 million people lived under this ideology. Their story is one of repression and oppression. Their story is also one of liberation.
Following Word War II, the Soviet Union refused to withdraw from the lands it had occupied. This action divided Eastern and Western Europe into opposing political and military alliances. The Cold War was on. Many of those living under communism remained captive for five more decades.
By the mid-1980s, the Soviet Union had begun to reform its own political and economic systems. The new Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, began a period of rebuilding the nation according to more democratic principles (a process known as perestroika). He also encouraged Soviet citizens to share their concerns openly (a policy known as glasnost) and to participate in free elections.
As the Soviet Union gradually restored some liberties to its citizens, the people of Eastern Europe demanded their rights, too. Over a few

short years (1989-1991), the so-called Iron Curtain was torn apart as these nations reclaimed their liberties. The twin legacies of Nazi fascism and Soviet communism disappeared--freedom took their place.
Poland Poland was a focal point for 20th century
oppression. The German Nazis first invaded and conquered the nation. Then, the Russian communists conquered the country. During World War II, the Soviets committed many human rights abuses in Poland. Perhaps one of the worst examples was the execution of 22,000 Polish prisoners of war in the Katyn Woods massacre in 1940.
While Western Europe was liberated after Hitler's defeat in 1945, Poland was not. The Soviet Union created a satellite government that limited and restricted individual liberties. The government tortured and imprisoned those who opposed it. Martial law was frequently imposed. Officials limited religious liberty, though the Catholic Church continued to play a significant role in the lives of the people.
Courageous individuals and organizations led various anti-communist efforts during these years. Workers in the shipyards went on strike. Finally, in June 1989, Poland held free elections. One political party triumphed in this election:

BACKGROUND ESSAY

Solidarity. Solidarity was anti-communist, antiSoviet, and independent of government control. Its leader, Lech Wale�sa, was elected president of Poland one year later. Communism was dead in Poland.
Hungary and Czechoslovakia Hungary and Czechoslovakia fell to communism in the late 1940s. Hungary changed radically. The economy was nationalized. Government officials arrested, tortured, deported, or executed thousands. Religious instruction was banned and religious leaders were imprisoned. Russian language, culture, and traditions replaced many native Hungarian customs. Hungary made a dramatic attempt to find its way toward freedom. In 1956, Hungarians rose up against their communist masters. The uprising began as a student demonstration. According to a participant,
Work in Budapest stopped. Everyone went out on to the streets weeping. People read the points [the students' demands for greater liberty] and then rushed home or to their factories. . . . The Communist Party forbade this in vain. Everyone was talking about it: in conversation, over the telephone, the news spread in a few hours and within a short time all Budapest became an ant-hill. People pinned the Hungarian national symbol to their clothes, and a really fantastic miracle occurred, for I regard it as a miracle that the whole people became unified. . . .On the morning of this day, for the first time, someone

had dared to say that the Russian troops should leave Hungary. We had reached the point where we dared to say this publicly. This was what gave us unity, and the point at which the chains were broken which had bound us until then . . . everyone was on familiar terms, everyone could be trusted, everyone had a feeling of complete unity, because the entire system based on lies collapsed in a moment on the morning of 23 October. (Excerpt from the 1957 United Nations Report of the Special Committee on the Problem of Hungary.)
The jubilation did not last. On November 4, Soviet tanks invaded Hungary and crushed the revolution. 20,000 Hungarians perished and another 200,000 fled as refugees. There would be no freedom in Hungary until 1989 when a peaceful transition to democracy began.
The Red Army also occupied Czechoslovakia in 1944. By 1948, Czechoslovakia was another Soviet satellite. Jails and concentration camps held those who challenged government policies.
In 1968, the Czechs revolted against the Soviets. This uprising, known as the Prague Spring, was suppressed. Thousands of Czechs fled the nation. Yet, the seeds of revolt had been planted. By the 1980s, failed economic policies and the Soviet Union's more moderate politics led to widespread unrest. In just ten days in 1989, a non-violent uprising, the Velvet Revolution, toppled the government. Its leader, the poet and playwright, V�clav Havel, observed, "I really do inhabit a system in which words are capable of shaking the entire structure of government, where words

can prove mightier than ten military divisions." The Czech nation had begun its transition to democracy through words--not violence.
The Hungarian and Czech revolts (1956 and 1968) were initially unsuccessful. Communism continued to dominate Eastern Europe through the 1970s. However, these early attempts to bring about political change inspired thousands of people to oppose and eventually overthrow their oppressive governments.
The Baltic Nations: Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania
Nearly fifty years earlier in August of 1939, communist oppression began in the Baltic nations. The Russian occupation in June 1940 initiated a half-century of terror and intimidation. In Latvia, thousands of Russians were moved into the country in an effort to supplant Latvian culture and nationalism. Latvians were arrested, imprisoned, and deported. At least 10-15 percent of the Latvian population was eliminated by the Soviets.
During the next ten years, resistance to the Soviets was carried out by the "forest brothers." This group of 10-15,000 Latvian fighters lived in huts and tunnels in the countryside. Through sabotage, robbery, and sometimes murder they resisted the communist system. The last of the forest brothers surrendered in 1957. It would be thirty more years before the Latvians were no longer victimized by communism.
The people of Estonia also had their own "forest brothers" as they, too, suffered under communist repression. By the late 1980's, demonstrations

throughout Estonia called for an end to Soviet domination. The most powerful and persuasive of these demonstrations were the national songfests.
The "Singing Revolution" lasted from 19871991. At spontaneous gatherings and at national song festivals, hundreds of thousands of Estonians sang the national and patriotic songs that had been banned under the Soviets. Lyrics such as "May God watch over you, my precious fatherland" fostered a nationalistic spirit that led to increased demands for Estonian independence. In 1991, this goal was achieved.
Lithuanians also endured collectivization, mass deportations, and limitations on their liberties for nearly fifty years. Yet, they retained their commitment to their national heritage and to their strong Catholic faith. Hymns and national anthems were sung throughout the nation in the late 1980s in protest of the Soviet presence.
The most memorable singing event took place on August 23, 1989. A human chain of nearly two million people began in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius and stretched almost 400 miles through Riga, Latvia, to Tallinn, Estonia. People from three nations linked hands along this chain, sang national anthems, and remembered those who had died in their struggle against communism. As one Baltic activist commented, "Until now, revolutions have been filled with destruction, burning, killing and hate, but we started our revolution with a smile and a song." Lithuania declared its independence six months later.
Actions such as these resulted in the disintegration of the Communist bloc in

2 | Gorbachev began a period of re-
building the Soviet Union according to more democratic principles (perestroika) and encouraged citizens to share their concerns openly (glasnost). As the Soviet Union gradually restored liberties to its citizens, the people of Eastern Europe demanded their rights, too.

3 | The economy was nationalized. Gov-
ernment officials arrested, tortured, deported, or executed thousands. Religious instruction was banned and religious leaders were imprisoned. Russian language, culture, and traditions replaced many native Hungarian customs.
4 | Lech Wale�sa was the leader of Soli-
darity, a Polish political party which was anti-communist, anti-Soviet, and independent of government control. He was the first post-communist President of Poland. V�clav Havel, a poet and playwright, helped to lead the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia.
5 | Forms of resistance included the fol-
lowing: strikes, student demonstrations, poetry, the "forest brothers", and national songfests.
6 | At national song festivals, Estonians
sang patriotic songs banned under the Soviets, fostering a nationalistic spirit leading to increased demands for independence. Lithuanians sang hymns and national anthems. A human chain of singers stretching 400 miles through the Baltic nations united people in their opposition to communism.
