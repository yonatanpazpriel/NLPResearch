Hi, I have attempted several times to follow your instructions about signing up to speak, but upon dialing the given phone number and access code, my TMobile phone is refusing to connect to the conference call service you have chosen. Luckily I have been able to follow the webcast, but I will not be able to comment verbally, apparently.
Several speakers have spoken about the Ethnic Studies representing a foundational value of respect and building bridges. These are wonderful goals and the current draft is an improvement over the last one in that regard. However, the current draft of the ESMC does still contain material that is contrary to those goals, including (but not limited to) Guiding Principles with links to hateful material demanding the destruction of the state of Israel. In order to fulfill the vision of an Ethnic Studies curriculum based on respect (including for the thousands of Israeli-American students in California schools), it is crucial that the guiding values and principles be revised to ensure they cannot be used to justify promoting hateful agendas in the classroom.
