From: Haute Drop-Off Denim Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 10:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Draft changes of ESMC
Thank you so much for working to re-draft the ESMC. Jewish hate on college campuses from students and professors is at an all time high with so much Mis information being sold as facts. Education is the cure for these dangerous stereotypes.

Thank you for working to include all people and to ensure generations of Jewish hate finally dissipates, when people use these stereotypes Jews are in more danger than ever, hate crimes against Jews are NUMBER one of any minority group. Both the left and right seem to buy into the stereotypes.
Warm regards, Mara Menachem
