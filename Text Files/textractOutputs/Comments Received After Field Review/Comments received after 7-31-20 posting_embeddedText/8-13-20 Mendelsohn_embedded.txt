My name is Natalie Mendelsohn. I am a Senior at Alameda High School in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am 3rd generation Holocaust survivor. My grandfather was born in Poland and lived through the Holocaust. I would like to address chapter 3's reference to American Jews when discussing populations displaced by War and Genocide. This section highlights "the effect that World War II and the Holocaust had upon the American Jewish population." While I appreciate this reference to the Holocaust, it does not do justice to the diversity of the American Jewish experience. Not all American Jews are from Eastern Europe. Prior to the mass immigration of European jews, Spanish and Portuguese Jews represented the bulk of America's thensmall Jewish population. More recently, we have had Jews come to California to flee oppression in Iran, Arab states, the former Soviet Union, and elsewhere. Oversimplifying the historical suffering of the Jewish people by emphasizing only the Holocaust dilutes our rich and diverse history. I am speaking up for students whose experiences are ignored far too often and urging you to make this curriculum more inclusive. Thank you. Natalie Mendelsohn
