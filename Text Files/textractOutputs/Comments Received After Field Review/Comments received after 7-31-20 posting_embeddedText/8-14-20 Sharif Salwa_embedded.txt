From: Salwa Sharif Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 5:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Including Arabs and Palestinians in Ethnic Studies Curriculum
As a former employee of LAUSD and strong believer in public education to do the right thing of teaching our kids the truth about Arabs and the struggle of the Palestinian people, and as a taxpayer, citizen, and longtime resident of beautiful sunny California, I demand California Department of Education (CDE) to include Arab Americans and Palestinian History in K-12 education in the curriculum of Ethnic studies.
