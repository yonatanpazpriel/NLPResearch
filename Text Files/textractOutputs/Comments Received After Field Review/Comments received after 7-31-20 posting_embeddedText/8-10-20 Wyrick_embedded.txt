Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
I applaud the board of education for removing this farce a class. If they want to learn Arab history maybe they should fund it on their own and not thru our tax dollars. This is exactly what they tried to do in SDUSD and were removed thru lawsuits from the FCDF.
I am just wondering why we would need Arab American studies in our curriculum. When most student don't even know anything about American history. Tell me why would we need to include this when our schools are ranked 47th in the nation. Why don't we focus more on the things that matter like Math, Science, English, and AMERICAN HISTORY.
The reason we see so much rioting and looting in this country right now is because the school system has been leading the children in the wrong direction for generations. Teaching them to hate this country its founding and giving them no hope for the future. California needs to rethink how we educate our children because you are failing them and we are facing the consequences for that as we speak.
Again thank you for removing a curriculum that has no place in our schools. Any classes that promote a race above another only teaches more and more children that the color of their skin is more important than the content of their character.......
And also the group (CAIR) pushing for this a know terrorist organization with ties to Hamas, Hezbollah, Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS. do not allow them into your schools or their will be lawsuits to follow.
Sincerely, kris wyrick
