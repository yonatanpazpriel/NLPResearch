Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,

My name is Judith Goldberg and I'm a California resident, grandparent and former teacher.

Our society definitely has a problem and I appreciate the IDC's efforts to address it. Hopefully, you can revise the Guiding Values and Principles, so that the curriculum will build bridges of intergroup understanding, ensure critical thinking, and foster respect for diverse viewpoints.

The second draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, while improved, still promotes a divisive "us vs. them" agenda. As an educator, I should think that your goal would be to encourage free and critical thinking by providing guidance for teachers to expose students to multiple, possibly competing sources of information There are always two sides to a story. Both sides should be presented and considered. I would like your program to build empathy and consideration. I would like you to be certain that your program does not stoke anger.

Thank

you,
