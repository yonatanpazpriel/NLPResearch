From: SHARON FRITSCH Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 4:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please keep Arab-American studies and Pacific Islander studeies in the high school curriculum
Dear Educators: I have heard huge misunderstandings among most Americans about the nature of Mideast history, politics, religion and culture. This is a problem. America has been and currently is in several Mideast wars. America's lack of understanding of this region leads voters to tolerate policies that trample human rights.
Please do not remove Arab-American studies from the high school curriculum.
Thank you, Sharon Fritsch
