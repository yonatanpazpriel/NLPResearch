Dear ESMC Committee Members,
I am Larry Yelowitz, a 41 year resident of Sunnyvale, CA and a concerned grandparent of school-age children.
I am glad to see that some of the more blatant, explicit antisemitic aspects of the previous curriculum have been removed in the latest version, but there is still a long way to go before this version is ready for prime time. At a very high level here are some of my main concerns.
Since BDS is antisemitic (despite its claims of being "only" anti-Zionist), it is disconcerting to see reference to the book Education at War, with its "linkages" and "solidarity" to BDS. According to 2018 CA Hate Crime Statistics, anti-Muslim bias events decreased by more than 40% while anti-Jewish events increased by over 20%. Antisemitism, including methods for countering it, should be given at least as prominent an emphasis as Islamophobia in the new curriculum.
It is also jarring that the primary reference to Jewish communities is in the context of our communities being beneficiaries of "white privilege." Numerous CA communities in which Jews reside also contain Mizrahi Jews, Kurds, Iranians, Coptic Christians and other minority groups that collectively represent 60% of California's Middle Eastern population. These groups all deserve equitable representation in the revised curriculum
Again, thank you for this improved version of the curriculum; I hope my comments spur much greater improvement for the next version.
