From: wrenpalmer Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
My name is Wren Palmer, and I am a Samoan student at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I grew up in California, and I have always felt so excluded in academia, even now in higher education. As a Ronald E. McNair scholar, I continue to fight for inclusivity and proper representation. Pacific Islander histories and cultures matter and deserve to be included in the curriculum. If its unique characteristics alone are not enough, I encourage you to consider its significance in American culture, perhaps then you will see it has value. Otherwise, it's broken down quite clearly here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmwvgqIjTJs
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens. We also demand that the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) committee of writers and experts be reconvened. This committee of Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Sincerely, Wren Palmer
