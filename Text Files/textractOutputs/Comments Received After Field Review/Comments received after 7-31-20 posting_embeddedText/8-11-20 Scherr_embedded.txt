Dear Instructional Quality Commission, Thank you for removing explicit anti-Jewish wording from Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum version 1. I do not like the political ideology that remains. For example, the anti-Zionist references in footnotes, links, bibliography: Appendix A, page 6, Line 8166-8167
My children learned to keep quiet when unthinking demonization of Israel came up in what should be friendly university conversations. Peers had been indoctrinated in early versions of this political ideology. Do not teach this in elementary school.
Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles to build bridges of intergroup understanding and encourage critical thinking.
Thank you
Lawrence Scherr
