Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
Stop the erasure of the rich history of Arabs. We are more than your stereotypes and without a proper education, Californians will never understand the barriers Arabs have to overcome everyday to succeed. This is outrageous and we will not stay silent about this intentional altering of history.
Sincerely, Yasmin Abusaif
