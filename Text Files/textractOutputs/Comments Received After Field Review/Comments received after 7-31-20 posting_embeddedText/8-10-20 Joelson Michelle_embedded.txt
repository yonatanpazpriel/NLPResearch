From: Michelle Joelson Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 7:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not support anti Semitic content in current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear CDE member,
My name is Michelle Joelson, I am a mother of a high school student in San Mateo- Foster city school district. I am writing to implore you to reject the current anti-Semitic draft of the ESMC.
As a Jewish woman and mother I am deeply concerned about the anti-Jewish/anti Israel nature of the current draft. References in the curriculum promote the BDS movement which at its core is an anti-Semitic movement masquerading as `anti-Israel.'
As you may know most hate crimes in the U.S target Jews; as such I expect that our childrens' schools would be a place of tolerance and education against ALL hate rather than a place which feeds anti- semitism.
Thank you in advance for rejecting the current draft and for doing all you can to combat both overt and covert anti-semitism.
Sincerely, Michelle Joelson
