My name is Jasmine Amin and I am a senior at Beverly Hills High School. I appreciate that some shortcomings from the first ethnic studies draft have been corrected and things are moving in the right direction. With that being said, there are still many problems.
For example, in the section titled "Eight Outcomes of Kï¿½12 Ethnic Studies Teaching" it says, "Ethnic studies....arose with the intent of giving voice to stories long silenced, including stories of injustice, marginalization, and discrimination". So why do the revisions still barely mention one of the most historically marginalized and discriminated people in the world, the Jewish people?
As a Persian Jew, I have spent a lot of my time advocating for the right of the Jewish people to have a homeland in Israel. A lot of the antisemitism that I have faced in my life as a seventeen-year-old girl has come from people who did not learn what the Jewish people went through during the Holocaust or as refugees from Arab states and Iran. My peers do not understand the amount of antisemitism still prevalent in this world today.
If children were taught at a young age the severity of the hate that I, and my fellow Jews still face, we could begin to put an end to antisemitism. Education is the first step, I urge you to add the `injustice, marginalization, and discrimination" of the Jewish people's story to the curriculum. Thank you.
