From: HELEN WEINSTEIN Sent: Tuesday, August 18, 2020 3:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Am concerned. Need more information please
I am very pleased that ethnic studies will be part of our children's education.
As a Jewish resident of California, I, and many others in my community are very unhappy -- even with the revised version.
I would welcome from you a list of the academics who worked on the course material. And, VERY IMPORTANTLY, their credentials that drew you to choose these academics to be responsible for the Jewish/Israel section.
Thank you very much, Sincerely, Helen Weinstein
