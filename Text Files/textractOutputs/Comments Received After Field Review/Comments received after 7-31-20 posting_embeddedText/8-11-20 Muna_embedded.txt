From: Hanikka Muna Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:30 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Curriculum: Pacific Islander Studies
Dear IQC Commissioners,
My name is Hanikka Muna. I am an SFSU alumni. I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
As I said, I graduated from SFSU and am now a homeless outreach worker for Contra Costa County and working on admission to medical school. Lack of Pacific Islander representation in curriculum is concerning to me because I see the effects of intergenerational trauma and social reproduction across my PI community everyday as an outreach worker. Our community is disproportionately affected by socio economic issues including access to immigration, healthcare and social services that in turn negatively affect our health outcomes as a people. These effects have only been exacerbated by COVID-19. Communities of color including the PI community continue to be affected by gentrification and we keep seeing more and more people of color becoming residentially segregated and unhoused/ pushed out of their homes creating instability that transcends generations.
Looking at PI studies, we would know that this trend is not new. Our people have been pushed out of our homeland, and placed in oppressive conditions throughout history since the start of colonization. PI studies gives our youth the tools for agency that our ancestors might not have had. As a PI a part of the Chamorro diaspora, I came to higher education nervous that I would not succeed. I felt out of place in my STEM classes dealing with the impacts of imposter syndrome that I still continue to feel today. The PI community at SF State taught me that I belong in higher education institutions and that I can use my education to make a difference in the community. The PI club taught me about the history of Oceania and our shared heritage and created a home that I would not have found otherwise. These spaces of shared heritage bolsters academic success and resilience in students like myself that struggled with their transitions to academic institutions. It would be a mistake to take these opportunities away from PI students, and instead continue to work within the oppressive framework of our society silencing the most marginalized by not telling our stories within PI studies.
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens. We also demand that the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) committee of writers and experts be reconvened. This committee of Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact 925-808-8570 to provide further information
Sincerely,
