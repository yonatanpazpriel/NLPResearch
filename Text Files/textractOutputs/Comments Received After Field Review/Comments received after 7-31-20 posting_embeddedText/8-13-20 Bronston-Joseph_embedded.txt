From: Emily Bronston-Joseph Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 3:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum should include Arab American Studies
To Tony Thurmond and Linda Darling-Hammond,
I am a future educator, currently getting my multiple subject teaching credential at UC Berkeley. I am writing to express my concern about the erasure of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the changes made to the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Both must be included in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
It is important that the ESMC not be diluted or changed to a different framework. Students need Ethnic Studies to build empathy, unity, and solidarity with one another. Ethnic studies also leads to improvements in academic and social outcomes for students. Following a decades-long tradition, Ethnic Studies must include both Arab American and Pacific Islander studies.
Sincerely, Emily Bronston-Joseph
