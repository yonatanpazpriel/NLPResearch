Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I a parent of 3 children raised in the public school system, having worked in the public school educational system over 10 years previously, applaud some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am highly concerned by the imposition of the offensive, onesided ideology that still remains in this current flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns (take examples from the email:
� Exclusion of organiations such as www.Hias.org an originally Jewish organization found over 100 years ago for Jewish refugees, now works for many communities worldwide including the LatinX, Middle Eastern and African refugee communities.
� The lack of identifying the variety of oppressions, that included white on black persons, as well as within POC communities that has historically existed.
� That Ford of Ford Auto Company founded the White Nationalist movement in the US that was specifically to target Jewish peoples. https://www.bridgemi.com/michigangovernment/henry-ford-and-jews-story-dearborn-didnt-wanttold https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/the-dark-legacy-of-henry-fordsanti-semitism-commentary/2014/10/10/c95b7df2-509d-11e4-877c335b53ffe736_story.html
� The countless `real estate' covenants that exist in California to this date, though not enforceable, that excluded `Blacks and Jews' from purchasing property in various communities.
� We need more conversations such as this one to unite the fight against hatred, racism and bigotry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5174qrrDB3A
� Greater understanding of Jewish identity https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsTL4GSKW2Q
� This compelling argument that we are a people indigenous to the Middle East and that it is a region of complexity rather than a monolith Jewish-Americans Are Not `NonWASP.' We Are Non-White.
