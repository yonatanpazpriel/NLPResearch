From: Suzanne Levy Sent: Friday, August 7, 2020 4:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members,
I have written before regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and would like to thank you for the efforts in revising the first draft. However, I still have concerns regarding the anti Zionism/Israel and pro BDS language that is still being used. Any curriculum that makes one group look favorable over another group is biased at its core. The Model Curriculum should be non-partial so that students learn how to think and make their own decisions.
Thank you for your consideration.
Suzanne Levy Santa Maria, CA
