Hello,
I understand the focus on the experiences of specific groups of people. I wish there was more focus on broad principles of stereotyping, prejudice, and discimination that apply across groups. It is critically important for our kids to understand the conditions that lend themselves to bias, the reasons why people embrace bias, the ways in which biases affect actors and recipients, how bias may be altered, etc. These aspects of integroup bias do not apply only to particular groups--they are general principles. There is a science focused on these principles that is not well represented in the current proposal.
Thanks for your attention, Jeff Sherman
