From: shabtai Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 7:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) proposed changes
August 11, 2020
I, Shabtai Evan, appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am both concerned and upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
�Please remove ALL explicitly antisemitic slurs from the ESMC . �Please provide addition of guidance for teachers to expose students to "multiple
and often competing sources of information". Please provide addition of guidance for teachers to foster respect for diverse viewpoints.
I am a Californian who has watched the California education system degrade for 40 years.
Please let's not go down further with stuff like the ESMC mis-information.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Shabtai Evan Californian for Life
