Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Department of Education,
My name is Bruce Yawitz, MD, and I am a concerned parent of LAUSD students in Los Angeles, California. I am the grandchild of 4 immigrants, 2 from Belarus who escaped pogroms in the early 20th century, and 2 from Europe who were escaping antisemitism. Those who remained behind in Greece were transported to concentration camps in Germany and murdered during the Holocaust. My father experienced antisemitism on the streets of Brooklyn in the 40's and 50's, going so far as thugs checking to see if he was circumcised before assaulting him. I would hardly call those the hallmarks of white privilege. My mother grew up in a multigenerational household where Ladino Spanish was the spoken language, as Sephardic Jews of Spanish descent.
I appreciate your efforts to improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. For AB 2016 to achieve its objective of "preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures," my Eastern European and Hispanic history should be covered in an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am married to a Persian Jewish immigrant who also shares stories of 'otherness' in her upbringing, and her stories are shared by many within LAUSD.
Based on current events, it would seem like inclusiveness would be a positive and not a negative in our changing society. Please see fit to include us as well.
