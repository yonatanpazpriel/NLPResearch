To Whom It May Concern:
Alianza strongly supports an Ethnic Studies curriculum in our K-12 schools. Now is a time when Ethnic Studies should be expanding and championed given the racial strife and presidentially endorsed racism we are experiencing as a nation. Addressing the representation of the four major ethnic groups in our state standards, curriculum, and textbooks will provide our students with a greater understanding of their own history and how the world works in racialized ways. It is critical that Communities of color, who are part of the global and state majority, are not marginalized as the CA Department of Education (CDE) moves forward with finalizing the AB2016 CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Schools in California cannot serve as transmitters of white Eurocentric cultural and political attitudes at the expense of students of color.
While revisions are a normal part of the process by the CDE writers of the draft, the process utilized by the writers must be transparent. It is also critical that this curriculum be driven by the voices of Indigenous and communities of color. This curriculum cannot be delayed and fundamentally diluted by people without expertise in the field. Ethnic Studies provides a space to foster critical dialogue and empowerment and is a critical space that enables us to understand important social issues that the public often ignores.
We hope that the multiple indispensable contributions of Ethnic Studies over fifty years for the betterment of our academic institutions and our society will be the significant factor that enables us to move forward with a strong Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As the students working with Alianza have stated: "our 1.9 million high school students, of which1.4 million are of color, deserve this curriculum."
