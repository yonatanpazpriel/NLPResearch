Dear Commissioners,
I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
[INSERT paragraph describing yourself, work, & why the lack of PI representation in the curriculum is particularly urgent to you, your communities, the work you do]
My name is K.G. Castillo and I am a Senior studying Film at San Francisco State University. As a filmmaker, it is imperative that Pacific Islanders and Arab American Studies be represented in this Ethnic Studies curriculum because our youth deserve to see themselves in spaces they want to be in.
My ancestors are from the island of Guï¿½han and from the islands in the Philippines, however I was raised in the State of Hawai'i where Hawaiian Studies has been established since 1978. Coming to California in 2014 as a high school junior, I was shocked by the lack of knowledge folks had on Pacific Islanders. However, its not the people's fault, it is the education they learn in our institutions. Although, I was not learning about my own culture growing up, Ethnic Studies programs have helped me, to understand the people and the issues happening around me. Ethnic Studies has given me the necessary tools and lessons to fight for representation and the voices in my communities of color. It is critical that Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans be represented in Ethnic Studies so the youth know where they come from.
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens. We also demand that the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) committee of writers and experts be reconvened. This committee of Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact me to provide further information.
Sincerely, Kiara Gail "K.G." Fantone Castillo
