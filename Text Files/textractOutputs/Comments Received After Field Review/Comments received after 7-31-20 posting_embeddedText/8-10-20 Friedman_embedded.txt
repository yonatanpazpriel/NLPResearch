While I recognize the validity and usefulness of such a curriculum, it is equally important to not allow ideological and purely political dynamics to be implicit as well as explicit in the teaching material which will be utilized in our state's classrooms. We must have an approach which is both respectful of our history and inclusive regarding all of our minority communities. There is no call for discriminating, or marginalizing, or singling out for derision or prejudice against any group. Helping all groups feel respected is not congruent with prejudice against or radical defining of any other group, especially the the Jewish people of California both past and present. Middle Eastern and North African Jews as well as Jews emigrating from Israel are just as worthy of respect as all other minority groups that seem to be the focus of the proposed curriculum. Please consider these principles when finalizing this significant development in our schools. No room for dividing people's with bias and discrimination ; lots of space for honoring all ethnicities in our glorious state. Respectfully, Dr. Alan Friedman
