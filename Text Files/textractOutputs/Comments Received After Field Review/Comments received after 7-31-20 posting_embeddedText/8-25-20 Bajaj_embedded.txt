From: Monisha Bajaj Sent: Monday, August 24, 2020 9:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to submit public comment and sample lesson plans for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for the state of California. I am concerned that there is no sample lesson plan or curricular material that addresses the rich history and contributions of South Asian Americans in California. South Asian Americans number over 5 million in the United States, and, in California in particular, South Asian migrants came to the state as early as the late 1800s, contributing to agriculture, politics and social life. Dalip Singh Saund--an immigrant from India--was the first Asian American congressperson representing the Central Valley in the 1950s. Punjabi immigrants inter-married with Mexican women, creating new subcultures and traditions. Kamala Harris, the first Vice Presidential candidate of color for a major party, has South Asian heritage.
It is a glaring omission from the sample curriculum that there is little to no mention of South Asian Americans.
Attached please find 3 lessons that could be utilized in the model curriculum and for the ethnic studies requirement once it goes into effect. (These lessons are shared under a creative commons license for reproduction from their original source here - I am one of the original authors of these lessons, and am sharing with permission for the model curriculum and CDE to utilize these lessons if deemed appropriate).
Thank you for your consideration of this comment.
Sincerely,
Monisha Bajaj
