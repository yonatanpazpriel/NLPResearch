Hi!
I'm the parent to two children at Joaquin Miller Elementary (a public school in Burbank, CA).
It has come to my attention that Arab American and Pacific Islander studies will not be included in the revisions to the ethnic studies curriculum. As someone with children who will be directly impacted by this, I must insist that both be added.
Covid-19 and the death of George Floyd's murder have further revealed the racism and xenophobia that rules our country. Our children are our greatest hope for a more equitable future. If we can provide students with anti-racist education through ethnic studies, they'll be provided with the tools to navigate through the world with more empathy and solidarity. To this end, you must pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines and include Palestine in Arab American studies to create a holistic ethinic studies program. In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American studies are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
Thank you so much for your time!
