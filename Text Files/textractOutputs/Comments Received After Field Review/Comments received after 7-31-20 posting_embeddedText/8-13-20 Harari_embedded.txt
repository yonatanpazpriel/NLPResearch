Please do not limit the Jewish narrative to stories of suffering. Address anti-semitism, but first acknowledge the following 3 facts:
1. Not all Jews are white. 2. Judaism is not just a religion, it is a culture and a diverse and varied ethnic group. 3. Jewish people are indigenous to the region of Judea-Samaria. These are all facts. Should students feel threatened by these statements, then-- once we have context and historical foundations-we can address anti-semitism.
The Palestinian narrative must be included, as well, but to call Israelis colonialists is inaccurate on account of their indigeneity.
Please include historical examples of Jewish and Muslim Arabs living alongside eachother peacefully, as they did in Morocco, where my grandparents and great grandparents lived. The narrative of North African and Middle Eastern Jews deserves a more optimistic re-telling.
Best, Emily
