Hi! My name is Amber Yada, and I'm a parent and student in Educational Research at UC Berkeley.
I'm concerned about the revisions in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Erasure of Arab American and Pacific Islander histories isn't acceptable.
They both must be included in the Model Curriculum!!
We are asking for the original committee to reconvene to revise the original ESMC. We need experts from the Arab and Pacific Islander communities to lead. We need people who refuse to erase Palestine.
Please don't dilute the curriculum or rename it, reframe it. Include the communities most affected throughout the whole process! We are asking for a transparent process that involves consensus and clear structures for accountability.
Additionally, please consider:
� In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
� TURATH (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout History) is a 2020 report researched and written by the teenage members of Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to AYO's findings, more than 66% of the students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school.
We need you to move with urgency and conscience on this issue. All students need to have access to true ethnic studies curriculum, to learn about themselves and each other.
Thank you!
-Amber Yada
