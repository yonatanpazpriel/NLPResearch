From: Sam Battles Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 6:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: Include Arab American and Pacific Islander Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello all, My name is Samuel Battles and I am emailing you today to urge you to include Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in California's ethnic studies curriculum. I was born and raised in Berkeley, CA and attended our local public schools. While I am Chinese American, it wasn't until I went to college across the country that I truly learned about the anti-Asian histories of the Bay Area. It is extremely dangerous to ignore these histories. We must confront the stories of conflict and resistance and acknowledge how these histories affect us today. As we have seen with the racist attacks on East Asian American communities with COVID-19, these histories are not just in the past. In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban and Islamaphobic rhetoric, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum must include Pacific Islander and Arab American courses, including Palestine in Arab American studies. These groups have been historically excluded from our education, and are extremely underrepresented in our curriculum. Furthermore, ethnic studies scholars, teachers, and experts must be consulted in the formation of this curriculum.
Thank you for listening, Samuel Battles
