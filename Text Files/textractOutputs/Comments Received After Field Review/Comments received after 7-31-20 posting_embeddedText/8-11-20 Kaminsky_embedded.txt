From: Yana Kaminsky Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] URGENT Call to Action: CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I, Yana Kaminsky, appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am very concerned and upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
1. Misrepresentation of Jews and other ethnic groups, historical events and perspective. 2. Imposing a one-sided political ideology.
I am a parent, an immigrant from the former Soviet Union, experienced antisemitism first hand. This program would be offensive to my family, my parents and grandparents who were Holocaust survivors.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Yana, Alexander, Max & Renee Kaminsky.
