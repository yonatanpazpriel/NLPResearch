Hi, My name is Naomi Rubalcava Levinthal. I'm a high school junior in California. I took ethnic studies my freshman year, and it was a really valuable experience for me. It's really important to have a class that centers BIPOC stories and experiences and can help educate students on how to be anti racist. There may be some issues with how ethnic studies courses discuss Israel and Palestine, however I do not believe these issues warrant throwing away the curriculum. This is an incredibly important class that I was very lucky to have taken. Please give other CA students that opportunity. Thanks.
