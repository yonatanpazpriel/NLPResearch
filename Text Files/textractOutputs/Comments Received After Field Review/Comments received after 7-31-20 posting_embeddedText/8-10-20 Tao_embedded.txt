From: Catherine Tao Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC to include Arabic and Pacific Islander culture
Hello--
I am a science teacher at Oakland High School and I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
I live and teach in Oakland Unified School District. My school has a large Pacific Islander and Arabic community. It is vitally important to me that my students see themselves and their culture in the curriculum. This act of inclusivity not only important on a DEI front, but also instills in them that their culture is valued as much as every other culture that is taught.
Curating a high school science curriculum that decenters whiteness and promotes anti-racism is difficult because there are not very many examples of it that are available. I encourage you to invest this time and money to create a district wide curriculum that accomplishes these things for the betterment of our young people's education
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact myself to provide further information
Sincerely, Catherine Tao
