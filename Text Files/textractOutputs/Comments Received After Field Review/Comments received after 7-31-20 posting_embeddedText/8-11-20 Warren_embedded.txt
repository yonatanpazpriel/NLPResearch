From: Claire Warren Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 10:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support Pacific Islander Studies / Support Arab American Studies
My name is Claire Warren Born and raised in San Francisco between District 10 and District 11
In these neighborhoods there is many friends and families who are Pacific Islander.
A lot of people from the Pacific Islander community struggle with school and would benefit from having curriculum that relates to them.
I'm Filipino and have struggled with school. But that one elective I took made me want to pursue college and help my community.
We need Pacific Islander Studies in schools! Not doing so is NOT serving our community!
For Arab American Studies this is overdue. We need to be familiar with our Arabian neighbors history especially after 9/11. We must be in solidarity with them by knowing their side of the story of discrimination and how the 9/11 attacks effected their lives by hate crimes and stereotypes.
As a San Francisco resident and a Filipino American who wants better for our country, please support these classes! Thank you
