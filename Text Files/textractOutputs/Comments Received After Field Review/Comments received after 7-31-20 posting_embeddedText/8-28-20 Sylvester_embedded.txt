From: Hilary Sylvester Sent: Friday, August 28, 2020 8:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members,
I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.
Please remove all anti Israel and all anti Semitic rhetoric. It is biased, dangerous, and leads to hatred and violence against the Jewish communities.
Thank you for helping to end bias and discrimination against ALL ethnic communities.
Thank you. Respectfully submitted, Hilary Sylvester
