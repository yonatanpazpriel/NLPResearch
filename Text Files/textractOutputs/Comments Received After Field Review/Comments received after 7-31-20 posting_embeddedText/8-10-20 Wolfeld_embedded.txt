From: Jeff Wolfeld Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 2:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) proposal
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am a California resident with grandchildren in the public schools. My family is Jewish, and we have also endured the experience of having one of our child's textbooks defaced with a swastika in school. Please think for a minute about how that effects a child.
I appreciate the efforts you have made to improve the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but it still doesn't even approach the ESMC guidelines that it accurately and equitably represent the cultural and racial diversity of California in a balanced way.
I am particularly shocked by continued references to the book "Education at War", which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS and anti-Israel narratives. How can this possibly be representative of California's shared values, or the values laid out in AB 2016? References to this book must be deleted.
Along the same lines, please remove all links to anti-Israel and pro-BDS web sites. These sites are slanderous and malicious, and can in no way be part of a balanced curriculum. And trying to add balance by adding OPPOSING views won't work: you will not find any equally virulent and poisonous sites on the other side. The references must be removed completely.
Surely you have studied the Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum. That document provides good ground rules for course development, and you would do well to adopt many of its elements.
Thank you for your time, Jeff Wolfeld
