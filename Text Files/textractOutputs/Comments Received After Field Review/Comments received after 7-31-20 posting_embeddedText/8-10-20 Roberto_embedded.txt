Hello!
Hope you all are well in these difficult times. Thanks in advance for all your hard work on these curricula - I know it's a massive and critical task.
My name is Robert (Roberto) Gyemant and I am a concerned parent of three children in the public school system here in Alameda, California.
My family has both Ashkenazi and Sephardic ancestors, and I want to say I find it critical to both provide materials on Antisemitism in my children's curriculum, as well as on the story of Mizrachi jews who were dispossessed of their properties during the transition to Israel's statehood in the 1940s and '50s.
Indeed, I find it's impossible to meaningfully consider the rights of the Arab Palestinians who suffered (and continue to suffer) during this period without also discussing the suffering and loss of the nearly 1M Mizrachi Jews in Iran, Iraq, Egypt and the Maghreb.
My family has suffered antisemitism both before coming to the US and in the US, and I am sad to hear the fever pitch of recent events and outbreaks (on social media and elsewhere) of this very old sickness. Indeed, education (and interpersonal exchanges) are the only way to combat racism and antisemitism in all its manifestations.
Thanks for your time. Please let me know if you'd like me to expand.
All my best, Roberto
