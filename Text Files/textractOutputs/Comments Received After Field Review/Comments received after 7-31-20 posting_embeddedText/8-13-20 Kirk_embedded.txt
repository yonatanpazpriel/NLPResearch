From: Gabi Kirk Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 2:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on Agenda Item 2.A CDE Recommendations to the Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
1. Agenda Item 2A Meeting August 13, 2020 2. Gabi Kirk 3. My name is Gabi Kirk and I'm a PhD candidate at UC Davis. I'm a white Jewish woman who has attended California public schools since kindergarten. I am disappointed to hear that Arab American studies has been whittled down to a single lesson on immigration to the US, which while important, does not capture the rich analysis of Islamophobia, anti-Arab racism, and Palestine present in the original sample lesson plans. I reject the assertion that the original draft was antisemitic, and am concerned that the IQC today said they will vet the Arab American studies in particular for antisemitic language. This reinforces anti-Arab racism and Islamophobia, implying Arab Americans or Palestinians are inherently antisemitic. I implore the IQC to Reconvene the original committee of writers and experts to revise the original Model Curriculum (ESMC), maintain a critical ethnic studies framework, center the needs of Arab voices in the Arab American studies lessons, and to work within clearcut structures for accountability, transparency, and consensus-building moving forward.
