This is 5780 (on the Jewish calendar.) Anti-semitism is perhaps the very first -ism to exist. Hate has no place in CA. but, more than that, education is the primary vehicle we have in combatting Anti-Semitism. Those of us who grew up in public schools know the importance of teaching about the Holocaust, the reason, The Plan, the torture and the deaths. The phrase NEVER AGAIN relies upon an understanding of what happened to Jews (and others) during the Holocaust and beyond. Misconceptions are like breeding grounds for hate and blame which causes my community to constantly defend against those who would blame us for everything bad on the planet. Education is essential and without it we will see a greater rise in Antisemitism, unabated by history and facts.
