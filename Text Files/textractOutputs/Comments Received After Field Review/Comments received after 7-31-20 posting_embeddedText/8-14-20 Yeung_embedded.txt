From: Andrew Yeung Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 3:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment Regarding IQC Meeting Agenda Item 2A, 8/13/20
To members of the Instructional Quality Committee and all stakeholders concerning the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum,
As a community-based educator at a youth center grounded in racial justice and as a grassroots organizer with Teachers for Social Justice, I would like to join the many that have called for the following demands:
1.Reconvene the original committee of writers and experts of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the expertson Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy. Arab American scholars and teachers are the experts on Arab American curriculum and pedagogy. 2.Pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies course outlines and includes Palestine in Arab American studies. 3.Maintain the Ethnic Studies framework--with disciplinary knowledge, language, and pedagogy. Don't dilute it or convert it to a different field (i.e., multicultural studies, diversity studies, or area studies). 4.Work within clearcut structures for accountability, transparency, and consensus-building. Center those structures on Ethnic Studies practitioners of communities of color and Native peoples throughout the entire model curriculum process, up to ratification.
I hope the righteous, equitable, and just decision is made.
In community,
Andrew Yeung
