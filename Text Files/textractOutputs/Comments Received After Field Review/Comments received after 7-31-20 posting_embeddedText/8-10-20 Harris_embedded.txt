Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, As a California Parent and Grandparent, it's critical that curricula respects all ethnicities. Our family has FOUR generations where an American Born married an immigrant. Thus we embrace a blend of backgrounds and cultures. California curricula and Ethnic Studies needs to encourage cultural understanding, without the myopic perspective focused on victimhood, misrepresentation or blame. Don't make it "us verses them". That's one-sided. Be careful that footnotes don't teach blame either! The whole story of ethnicity in America should include the progress society has made in overcoming racism, the many successes of millions of persecuted survivors immigrating, working hard, overcoming horrible circumstances and becoming American success stories. This isn't an Arab, Zionist, Catholic, Jewish, Chinese, Polish, Italian, Native American, Black, Brown or any other issue- it's an American issue. The melting pot hasn't gone away.
Certainly the United States has a lot more progress to be made, but a rounded story is required for real education. Please don't endorse studies where one cousin blames another!
