From: John or Barbara Erickson > Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 9:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Reinstate Arab studies
Dear Members, I was appalled to learn that Arab American and Pacific Islanders have been excluded from the ethnic studies curriculum. This is a disturbing change, which reveals an ignorance and lack of support for these two groups. Both of them have suffered discrimination and harassment in our schools and our society. We must give them equal treatment with other groups. Please ensure that they will be reinstated immediately. In anticipation of your response, Barbara Erickson Berkeley, California
