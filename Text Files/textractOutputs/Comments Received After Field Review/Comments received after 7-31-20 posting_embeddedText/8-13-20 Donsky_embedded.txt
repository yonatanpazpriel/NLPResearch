From: Joanne Donsky Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 2:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please revise overall framework and guiding principles
I am waiting in line to speak, but it is unlikely that I will be called on. Here is what I intended to say:
I am Joanne Donsky, a parent of a California public school graduate from Portola Valley California.
I am likely one of few who has actually carefully read most of draft 2. While improved, so many disturbing problems remain. I have time to mention only two.
I was disturbed to see the divisive us vs. them, oppressor vs victim agenda remains. Labeling certain ethnic groups exclusively as victims and others as oppressors is divisive and does not uplift students of color.
Most important, the positive principles stated AB 2016 are NOT reflected in this curriculum. They should be explicitly incorporated into the guiding principles for the Model Curriculum and coded, obtuse language should be removed. The overall framework and guiding principles must be revised because all of the problems in the curriculum result from them.
Thank you.
