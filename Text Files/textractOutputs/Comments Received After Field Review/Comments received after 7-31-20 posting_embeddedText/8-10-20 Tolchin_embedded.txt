From: Stephen Tolchin Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 6:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Second Draft
Here are my Main Concerns and suggestions for revision:
* ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they are the basis of each unit and lesson plan. They: - do not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016 - advocate a narrow political philosophy - establish an "us vs them" agenda - partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students
* The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and antiIsrael elements from ESMC draft 1. - Add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development - Numerous sections of the ESMC need revision to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected".
* The few references to Jews are are misleading and offensive. - Include Mizrachi and other Jews of color - Remove links to, and group advocacy of, virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide - Add a definition of antisemitism that addresses sinister stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum.
* References to Middle Eastern communities should not favor one community over others
- Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern communities should be represented on an equal basis with Arab America. - Mizrahi Jews and other MENA ethnic groups represent ~60% of CA's MENA population (estimated 500,000 Californians). - Include the lesson plan, "Antisemitism as the Middle Eastern-American Jews," covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience produced by the JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa
I appreciate your attention to these suggestions.
