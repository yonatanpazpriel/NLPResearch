From: ROBERT FRANKLE Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing as a Jewish Californian who is concerned about the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). While some positive revisions have been made, further changes are required to address the offensive, one-sided political ideology that remains in the draft ESMC. For example, the few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. Furthermore, the second draft does not prevent teaching offensive, politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from the first draft of the ESMC.
As someone who is devoted to interfaith engagement, I know that education and dialogue are key to fostering understanding between diverse California faith communities. I am also keenly aware that antisemitism is a present and growing threat to Jews in California. Following the attack in Poway, my synagogue implemented many measures to protect our facility and our congregants. An ESMC that recognizes and values diversity and honors all faith traditions is critical to educating the next generation of Californians. I urge you to make the necessary revisions.
Thank you.
