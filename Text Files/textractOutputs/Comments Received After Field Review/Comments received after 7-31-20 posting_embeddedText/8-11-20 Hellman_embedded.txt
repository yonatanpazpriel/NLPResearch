Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
As a California public school educator for over 40 years, I appreciate the work you are doing. I also appreciate that you took the concerns that many of us sent last August and were willing to make changes.
1. 2. Thank you for including an identity unit, removing the explicitly 3. antisemitic slurs, and adding the expectation that we teachers expose students
to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints. 4.
The purpose of the California State History and Social Science Framework, with particular clarity from Chapter 20: Access and Equity and the Historical and Social Sciences Analysis and Intellectual Skills identified in the Social Studies Content Standards found in Appendix C of the Framework, further supports these expectations.
2. 3. However I am concerned that the curriculum and resources are not 4. adequately balanced or reviewed to provide multiple perspectives and historical
accuracy. No source or lesson should support or promote an agenda. Our national ethnic identities are complex and I note some recommendations and resources that are, at best, 5. oversimplified or doctrinaire. 6.
Our responsibility as educators and our curriculum should provide methodologies that instruct and develop our students' independent thinking skills so they can have a strong historical, unbiased, and meaningful understanding of the value of diversity in our democracy.
I ask that the Commission continue to use the best of the skills we are required to teach to review all of the curriculum and resources cited to check to be sure we are meeting the expectations of our State Standards, including providing antiracist and not antisemitic education.

With appreciation for your important work, Joy Hellman
