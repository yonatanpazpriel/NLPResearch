I have just learned that the IQC will be called upon today to vote on an ethnic studies curriculum that was revised just last night to re-include Pacific Islanders and Americans, when those groups had not been included in the updated curriculum released last week. Indeed, the decision appears so last minute, the curriculum on Arab Americans, that you are asked to approve, has yet to be drafted. This last minute jockeying is outrageous and voting on a curriculum not yet presented is wholly inappropriate, especially when the initial Arab-American module that was deleted was heavily slanted, taught hatred of the Jewish community and Israel, rather than compassion and understanding which are the stated goals of the ethnic studies program. The Jewish community has not been included in this curriculum although Jews are the number one target of hate crimes in California and the U.S.
Hopefully, the IQC can reject the latest and last minute behind closed doors recommendations of the Department of Education and refuse to vote on the additional modules that have not been vetted or indeed drafted.
Thank you. Helene Linker
