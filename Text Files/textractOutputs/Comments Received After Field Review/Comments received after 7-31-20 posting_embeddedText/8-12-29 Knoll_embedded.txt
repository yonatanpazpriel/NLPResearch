From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 4:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I remember the ethnic studies class I took as a university student; in fact, I have never forgotten it. We were required to immerse ourselves in one culture that was not our own. We were then required to present what we had learned in order to pass the class.
This class made such an impact on me that I told the professor that I believed it should be a required class. Only now, 30 years later, are some universities considering requiring some type of class studying race and how it has impacted our nation.
I cannot emphasize how important ethnic studies of all cultures are for everyone living in this country. Ethnic studies have been linked to increases in positive personal, academic and social outcomes for students.
Please reconsider the erasure of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies.
Thank you for your consideration.
