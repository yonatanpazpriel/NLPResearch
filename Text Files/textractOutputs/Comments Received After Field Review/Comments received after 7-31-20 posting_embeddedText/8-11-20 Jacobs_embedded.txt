Dear IQC,
I appreciate the improvements made to the ESMC. But more work remains. None of us want to spread misinformation. Specifically:
� Jews are indigenous to the Middle East. More than half of Israel's Jews are of non-European ancestry. Rather than the curriculum including links to opinions on anti-Israel/boycott activities, it would be educational to include fact-based links on the history of Middle Eastern Jews.
� Since the large majority of hate crimes (from both the left and the right) are against Jews, the curriculum has a glaring omission in not having a lesson and materials on identifying this as bigotry.
Jewish students should have their identities validated. I support complete information and history for all ethnicities.
And when I see misinformation and opinion-based materials, re: Jews, I also wonder if the same is true for other groups that I don't know as well.
Please. Bridges of peace and understanding can only be built with complete knowledge. Agenda-based obfuscating only breeds more hatred.
Thank you for considering another draft, Suzanne Jacobs California parent
