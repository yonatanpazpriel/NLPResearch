Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, As a California grandparent of a school aged child, I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), especially the removal of explicitly antisemitic slurs from the ESMC. However, I am still Deeply concerned by the proposed and flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. THERE IS SO MUCH HATE IN OUR COUNTRY NOW, I AM APPALLED AND SADDENED TO THINK THAT OUR SCHOOLS WOULD FEED THESE ATTITUDES !
Here are my major concerns:
They:
1) do not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016
2) advocate a narrow political philosophy
3) establish an "us vs them" agenda
4) It is partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students
5) The second draft does not prevent teaching of offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC draft 1
6) The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive
7) References to Middle Eastern Communities should not favor one community over others.
I would hope that you would
- Add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development - expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected - Remove links to, and group advocacy of, virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide - Include the lesson plan, "Antisemitism as the Middle Eastern-American Jews," covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience produced by the JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa - Add a definition of antisemitism that addresses sinister stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum

No one wants to grow up being hated and I fear you are encouraging this in this curriculum. We urge you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Thank you,
