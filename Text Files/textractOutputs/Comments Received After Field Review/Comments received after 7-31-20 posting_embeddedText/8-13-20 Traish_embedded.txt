Hi, I find it interesting how the Jewish callers identify Mazrachi Jews as Middle Eastern, thus a very clear indication on how ethnic studies is important in deconstructing imperial and colonial narratives of racial categorizes. This sort of classification and identification as Middle East is a colonial and imperial construction to lump a region together for economic, political, and social exploitation. To be historically correct, they are Arab--, Iranian---, and Turkish Jews.
BDS is in parallel with the South African boycott to rid themselves of racial economic, political, and social inequalities. It is a crucial part of the ethnic studies definition.
Second, I find it also very interesting to see how the Jewish learners have the self-confidence to stand up and speak in this discussion. They are confident that their status quo will remain the same, while the Arab learners are intimidated to speak out of fear for retaliation by the communities they live in. This is a clear sign of who is being bullied.
Thank you, Saidah Traish
