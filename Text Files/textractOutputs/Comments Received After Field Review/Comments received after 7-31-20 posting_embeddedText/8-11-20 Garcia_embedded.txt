From: Joel Garcia Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:59 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Original Draft
I would like to state my very strong support for the original Model Curriculum as presented by the ESMC panel of ES experts and guided by the "Guiding Principles, and Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching". Their outstanding work should not be diluted or in any way be disregarded. In fact these very experts should be reconvened as a soon as possible and be given the due respect they are owed before there is a finalization. The IOC and CA DOE must do right by the inclusion and expansion of Pacific Islander, Arab American (including Palestinian aspects), and West Asian American Studies. I was personally directly involved in the original advocacy and creation of Ethnic Studies through the TWLF at Berkeley and the United Front at UCSB. We overcame resistance and will continue to enrich and where necessary correct mainstream curriculum that does not give us our due. Be wise and be he right side of history that favors us all.
