Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, Thank you for making improvements to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). After going through it, I'm still concerned by the imposition of what I feel is one-sided political ideology that remains in this draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my concerns:
1. The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and antiIsrael
2. Remove links to, and group advocacy of, virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide
3. Include a lesson plan covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience.
I grew up in California, live in California, and went to college in California. I can tell you from my own personal experience that the amount of anti-Israel sentiment on campus was definitely something I experienced 20 years ago. My understanding is that it hasn't gone away and if anything has gotten worse and anything you can do to make strides to tell a more balanced story, I am certain will result in a better and more rewarding experience for your students.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns and try to show both sides of the story. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Sincerely, David Smith San Jose, California
