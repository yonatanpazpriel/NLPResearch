As grandparents with children that will be attending high school in San Jose, we urge you to revise the curriculum that presents the positive contributions of all groups and allow for dialogue that will create greater understanding while eliminating unfair stereotypes of any of the groups. Thanks for your consideration. Bob and Arlene Lapidus (residents of San Jose)
