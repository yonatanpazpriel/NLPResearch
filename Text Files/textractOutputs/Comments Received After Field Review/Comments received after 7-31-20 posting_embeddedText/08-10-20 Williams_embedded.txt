Hello, The current version of ethnic studies curriculum has taken out Arab American studies, which was a part of the original curriculum. Why would you reject Arab American Studies? Whatever could be the reason for doing that? Who is objecting and why??? Is it Islamophobia? Is it pressure from Zionists who want to erase all mention of Palestinians and their history? Totally unacceptable. It will deprive the next generation of students of knowledge of the heritage of Arab Americans. vital to understanding their histories and current realities. Please explain the real reason that Arab American studies is being taken out of ethnic studies. We shall know the truth and the truth shall set us free. Subterfuge shows total disrespect for the people of California. Thanks. I await your response. sincerely, Lew Williams
