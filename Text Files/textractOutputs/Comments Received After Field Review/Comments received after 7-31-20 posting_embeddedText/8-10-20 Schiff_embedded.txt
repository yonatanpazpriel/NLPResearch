Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am grateful for the improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. There are still several concerns I would like to mention. I am a California teacher, parent and taxpayer! Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroupunderstanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles. I note that the antisemitic slurs have been removed. However the anti-Zionist references remain in the footnotes, links and bibliography. I am concerned that Jewish students will continue to be targets of hate and bullying until this course has been carefully retooled. Ethnic identity is a critical part of each child's understanding of self. Under no circumstances should any group feel misrepresented by another. There is still much work to be done.
Thank you.
Amy Sporer Schiff San Jose, California
