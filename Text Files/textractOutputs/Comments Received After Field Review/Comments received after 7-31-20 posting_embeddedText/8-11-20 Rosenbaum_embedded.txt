Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am glad to see some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am very upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this current draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
 The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC's first draft.
 The ESMC Draft 2 does not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016.
 The draft is still encourages and supports "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students. Even though many of those items have been moved to the footnotes, they are still in the draft and should be removed.
I am a California parent of 3 children; our children have been the object of antisemtism multiple times. The proposed ESMC would lead to even more division and animosity towards the jewish community rather than less.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Aaron Rosenbaum
