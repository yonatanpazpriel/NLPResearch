Hello,
I am a second year Arab American student at UCLA School of Law. Arab studies should not be erased from the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Far too often we are decided to not be enough. When the US chooses to paint an entire region as a land field of bombs and fear, we are all impacted. It became immediately prevalent the lack of understanding my peers have of my Arab sisters and brothers, in light of the legal teachings of the Supreme Court case Iqbal vs. Ashcroft. My peers are individuals who will one day set the course of our nation as judges and their misinformation and stereotypes perpetuate because our education system has set them up for failure. Almost no students learn of Arab history, culture, or individuals. We are misunderstood to all be one homogenous religion and far too often our names are closely followed with slurs of terrorism and oppression. This cannot change without an education. I do not understand how we can spend years learning Algebra, without a whisper of the father of Algebra, an Arab Muslim scholar named Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi. We are as much present in the history of the world as our European, Asian, and African counterparts. Please reconsider the omission of Arab studies and ask yourself and those around you who praise themselves for diverse thought- how much do YOU know about Arabs? Thank you.
Best, Yasmin Abusaif
