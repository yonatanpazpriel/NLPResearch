From: Barbara Friedenthal Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 12:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education. I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am concerned by the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. There are positive changes to the earlier draft, such as the addition of guidance for teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints. But, as a California parent and grandparent, I have some concerns:
� The proposal needs to remove links to Anti-Israel pro BDS sites with malicious slander to Middle Eastern Communities. It should not favor one community over another.
� The few references to Jews are are misleading and offensive. � The ESMC should Add a definition of antisemitism that addresses
sinister stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum.
I urge you to make significant revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns,'
Thank You, Barbara Friedenthal
