Dear Mariana Astorga-Almanza,
My name is Sophia Armen, I am a scholar and researcher in the Ethnic Studies department at the University of California, San Diego, and I am writing to you on behalf of the scholars in this thread who do Armenian-American Studies in Ethnic Studies.
We are hoping to set up a meeting with you or speak briefly on the phone with you about the upcoming Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum meeting at the IQC August 13th. We are experts in the fields of the racialization of MENA/West Asian populations, and the history of Armenian-Americans in the United States that use frameworks that undo oppressive representations of our students and speak to the intersecting systems that they are facing.
Can we discuss the Armenian-American Studies and the larger West Asian portion with you on a brief phonecall or meeting? We would love to address both the issues with the revised draft and provide insight into alternatives.
Thank you for your time. We truly thank you for all your work!
Best, Sophia Armen
