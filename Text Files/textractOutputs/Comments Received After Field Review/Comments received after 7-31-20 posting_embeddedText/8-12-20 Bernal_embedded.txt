From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] class and race and ethnicity
Lets consider we are going to study German ethnicity. Would we mention the Nazis? Beethoven? Spinoza? Merkel? Ethnics studies implies that we are to see how advanced and developed other cultures are. But what about Ivan Groesny? and Pol Pot? Hiroshima? I admit some of these are demonized for political reasons, but their ethnicity- their DNA remain intact.
If we criticize ethnicities we are deemed racist. But what if we criticize racists like the Nazis, and many others (they were never the only ones) we are criticizing racism. This has a connection with taking down the ante bellum statues. Erasing history. Pretending bad things didn't happen.
The clue is that Americans have been talking racism for centuries. It is time to put that away and start talking about class. Most people in the world act according to class, not ethnicity. That is why Trump will allow millionaire highly trained foreigners into the country but will bar ordinary workers. Black Congress people are welcomed into the ranks- why? Not because they are black, but because they are millionaires. See how quickly that clicks?
