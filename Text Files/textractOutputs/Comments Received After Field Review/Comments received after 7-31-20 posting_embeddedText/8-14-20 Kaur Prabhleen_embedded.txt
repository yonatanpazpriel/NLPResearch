From: Prabhleen Kaur Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 10:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is a copy of my testimony for the IQC meeting held on Thursday August 13th 2020. Agenda item 2.A.
� My name is Prabhleen Kaur and I am a Sikh.
� My name is Prabhleen Kaur and I am a Sikh. I attend school in Fremont USD. Despite Sikhism being in the H-SS Framework, I have not encountered effective teaching about Sikhism in my classroom. Every year we arrange events to bring awareness about the turban and Sikh articles of faith in our school. That responsibility should not have to lie with me or my friends. The responsibility is for you to make sure my classroom is safe and inclusive for me and my peers. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, supports more meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum.
� The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
