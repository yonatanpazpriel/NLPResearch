Name: Alexandra Fetherston Email: [redacted] Organization:Resident Job Title: Subject: School Curriculum Comment: Hello, My name is Alex, and I live in San Francisco. I have lived in California my whole life. I attended Bay Area schools growing up, and now, as a young adult, volunteer with the 'Reading Partners' program in the San Francisco School District. Please continue to amend the 'California Ethnic Studies Curriculum in California Public Schools' to omit and not tolerate an agenda of antisemitism and anti-Israel bias in teaching, boycotting Israel as a form of oppression or punishment, and or encouraging ties with the controversial BDS group. I applaud the California Department of Education (CDE) for making important and positive changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) thus far,and thank you for your hard work during this difficult time. The previously made changes demonstrate a conscious effort to fix numerous problems in the first draft,which were highlighted in thousands of critical comments submitted by the public last year. While this new draft is clearly a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address a number of specific issues identified in the following pages. I appreciate the removal of explicitly anti-Israel and antisemitic content from the ESMC, and the inclusion of some important references to the Jewish American experience. I have sent a follow-up email to the IQC urging for a few additional, but extremely necessary, changes! THANK YOU!
