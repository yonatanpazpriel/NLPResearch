Re: Agenda Item #2
Dear IQC Members, CDE Director, and Board President,
I am Melissa Moreno. I am a full Ethnic Studies professor who works with teachers, former advisory member of the ESMC, former Indigenous Caucus Co-chair of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS), Member of the Liberated Ethnic Studies-Native American Studies, elected County Board of Education official, member of the California School Board Association, and member of the California County Boards of Education.
I write today as a citizen of California to strongly recommend that this poor and inappropriate quality model curriculum draft #2 not be approved. It does not represent Ethnic Studies, especially Native American Studies, curriculum framework. The following are also recommended:
� Use Ethnic Studies framework, concepts, and relevant sample lessons, including for Native American Studies that are absent in this draft
� Change "Native American/Indigenous Studies" to "Native American/American Indian Studies"
� This curriculum should not be approved as is, without Ethnic Studies and California Indian "teacher" consultation
Ethnic Studies, and Native American Studies, teachers would be glad to elaborate beyond a public comment on these recommendations.
With you the decision chiefly rests. Will you be for or against creating an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum with Ethnic Studies representation and voices in a time when institutional racism has been proven once again in our contemporary history?
Our Native American, Black, and Communities of Color do not have the technology access and ability to generate automated letters to the CDE from the State or around the world. But, we have arrived to this point in history of demanding authentic Ethnic Studies k-16 curriculum because of our ancestral

legacies, humanity, and hope that you--those in power--will do what is democratically ethical in this time in history.
Take care, be well.
Sincerely,
