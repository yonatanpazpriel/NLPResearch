From: Kimberly Boral Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 6:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments and Demands Re: the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Kimberly Boral. I was born and raised in California. I attended California public schools from kindergarten through college and now work for the University of California Office of the President.
It's never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as "vectors" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education. All students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice. The current draft and the entire process thus far for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) undermines, dilutes, and sidelines communities of color and critical dimensions of Ethnic Studies.
We demand: - The original committee of writers and experts are reconvened to revise the original ESMC. - Arab American and Pacific Islander studies be included in the ESMC. - You maintain the Ethnic Studies framework - with disciplinary knowledge, language, and pedagogy. - You work within clearcut structures for accountability, transparency, and consensus-building, centering the structures on Ethnic Studies practitioners of communities of color and Native peoples throughout the entire process, up to ratification.
In community, Kimberly Boral
