CDE,
I am writing in support of the original ethnic studies model curriculum. I have reviewed the changes that have been made and they do not provide fidelity to the mission and vision of ethnic studies. I urge you to meet with the original writers of the curriculum and honor their expertise in the field. This document should NOT be published in this condition. Considering the unmasking of systemic racism that has occurred in the past couple of months, now more than ever we need an ethnic studies education that centers the voices of communities of color from the perspective of communities of color. This ethnic studies education must go beyond social studies/ history and be embedded into every aspect of schools' program structures.
Best, Ver�nica Gonz�lez
