From: Roger N. Drew Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] No more attacks on ethnic studies! Reinstate Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander Studies!
� To whom it may concern:
�
� I am writing to demand that Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander Studies are reinstated in the curriculum. It is truly shameful that you are erasing entire communities, entire peoples, entire part of the world from the curriculum. �
� Put students first and include Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander Studies in the curriculum! �
� I also demand that the original curriculum writers are reconvened to give feedback prior to the November revisions. �
� Respectfully, � Roger N. Drew
