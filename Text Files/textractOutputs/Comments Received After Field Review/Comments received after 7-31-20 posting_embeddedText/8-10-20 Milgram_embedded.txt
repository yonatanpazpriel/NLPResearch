From: David Milgram Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 1:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Current draft curriculum does not deserve approval w/o modification
The current curriculum draft, while addressing some important failings in the original document, does not meet the standard required of a constructive civic-minded curriculum. Primary among its continuing failures is the casting of ethnic communities as victims rather than as active participants contributing to the civic California and US community. This one-sided portrayal is demeaning to the vast contributions that ethnic communities in their diversity of culture and values have made and continue to make to our society.
First and foremost, an ethnic studies curriculum is a civics curriculum whose intent must be to educate the next generation of productive American citizens. It must start from the perspective that those values that have bound ethnic communities together under the American flag are worthy and even though fairness and equality demand further change, students need to respect their fundamental citizenship as their heritage.
Please do not approve the current draft without providing substantial grounding in the power and worthiness of the American experiment in Democracy.
