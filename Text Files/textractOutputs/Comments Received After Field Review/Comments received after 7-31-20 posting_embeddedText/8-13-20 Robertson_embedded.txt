Dear committee,
I have lots of Jewish friends. They are harassed, called names, threatened for their lives.
My much loved friend have had their lives in danger by "progressive" activists who conflate anti-Israel with anti-Jewish. More and more Jewish people, including students, are being pushed out of spaces in student government, local government, and activist groups.
Please make sure the ethnic studies curriculum presents an UNBIASED view of conflicts in the Middle East as well as presents the history of Jewish people accurately, including Jewish people of color.
We must emphasize how to help each other, not tear us apart. We cannot allow for more hate.
If this is not presented with an unbiased view you will be putting people's lives in danger.
Thank you,
Cheri Robertson
