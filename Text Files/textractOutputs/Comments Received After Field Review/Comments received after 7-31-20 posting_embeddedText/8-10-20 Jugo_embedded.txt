From: Hanna Jugo Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 4:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Written Statement for Public Comment on ESMC
To Whom It May Concern,
Buenas yan Hafa Adai. I am submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am greatly concerned with the lack of Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
I am a Chamorro woman, born and raised in the island of Guam. Although I was never given the opportunity to explore ethnic studies growing up in Guam, its influence on my college years in San Diego continues to aid me in everything from my self confidence to my career. The values, resources, and history I learned from my Ethnic Studies courses helps me navigate my community during times of both great and distressing change (ie, what is the Pacific Islander role in the BLM? Why should a small island in the Pacific care about BLM?). It has also given me the confidence to speak up during times of injustice and ignorance.
If I have gained so much from ethnic studies in my four short years in higher education, I can only imagine what young students may gain in all years of primary schooling. If I was given the opportunity, confidence in myself and my community would've skyrocketed. We would be more inclined to challenge policies and beliefs that discount our existence (much like this). Pacific Islanders may be divided geographically, but we are a strong and proud people whose culture deserves a highlight. I frankly cannot fathom why we have been removed from the curriculum.
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Sincerely,
Hanna Jugo, M.S. Guam, USA
