Hello,
My name is Maris Schwartz, and I'm a Los Gatos, California, resident with two teenaged sons.
I am deeply troubled by the ethnic studies program that is currently up for a vote. Even with its revisions, I find the overall program hate-filled and divisive, especially with its offensive portrayal of Jews. I couldn't believe what I was reading!
I know the political climate is rotten now, but that doesn't give you the right to scapegoat another ethnic group. You cannot trade one type of hate for another. It's not us versus them. We have to fight this together, as Jews, Muslims, Christians, whomever, whatever!
I'm a former New Yorker, born and bred in Brooklyn. As a kid growing up in the 70s, I have to say I grew up in a more culturally diverse and accepting climate than what my sons are experiencing now. This societal decline is partly due to politically motivated measures like the California Ethnic Studies program. The program seems like a plan right out of 1939 Germany. Really.
Please stop the hate. Now!
