To whom it may concern,
My name is Eitan Schwartz, and I'm a Los Gatos, California, resident with two teenage sons.
I am deeply troubled by the CA ethnic studies program that is up for a vote on Aug 13. Even with the 2nd
draft, I find the overall program continues to paint a narrative that directs teachers to push an offensive, politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel bias.
I think it's important to make it clear that racism is bad, period! Some of the claims are ludicrous such as equating Israel with apartheid even though the arab population is represented in government, and other institutions. Contrast that with the way 850,000 Mizrachi jews were expelled from muslim countries.
Instead of links to anti-Israel pro-BDS sites, they could link to human rights watch videos, such as https://www.facebook.com/hillelneuer/videos/572415140228541/
We are being bombarded by one-sided political ideology on social media pitting one racial group against the next. Let's at least ensure that our schools provide a more neutral and balanced view.
Thank you Eitan Schwartz Los Gatos, California
