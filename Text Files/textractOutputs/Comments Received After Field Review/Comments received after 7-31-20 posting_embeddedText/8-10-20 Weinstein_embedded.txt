From: HELEN WEINSTEIN Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 12:24 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: senator.hill@senate.ca.gov; assemblymember.berman@assembly.ca.gov Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Program
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I HELEN WEINSTEIN (applaud) some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am VERY CONCERNED by the overall flowed Model that is being considered!
Jewish lives matter, too. Please be sensitive and responsive to the Jewish community regarding our legitimate concerns, apprehension, and worries about the content of the Ethnic Studies Program. Please don't be a party to the current very high level of Antisemitism. Working in concert with Jewish scholars, historians and clergy people will bring about a factual and accurate lesson plan.
Thank you very much, Helen Weinstein
