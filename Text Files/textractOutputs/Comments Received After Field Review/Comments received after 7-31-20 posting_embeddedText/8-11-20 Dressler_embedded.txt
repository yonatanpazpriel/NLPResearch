From: Star Dressler Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 2:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Concerns from Citizen
Hello! My name is Star. It has come to my attention that the ESMC current draft does not respect the original pedagogy and values of ethnic studies, and does not include Pacific Islanders nor Arab Americans. The exclusions of these peoples means that you are contributing to their "erasure" from society, much similar to how America has treated the Native Americans.
This is shameful, you should not call yourselves ESMC without giving respect to these important groups of people. I am demanding that you readjust your draft to reflect foundational Ethnic Studies values and to include Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans.
