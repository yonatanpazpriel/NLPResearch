From: Gene Fichtenholz Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concerned about Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Gene Fichtenholz.
I am a California resident and a parent.
I am concerned that the second draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, while slightly improved, is still absolutely unusable if we were to think of it as educational. It:
�
� Includes one-sided political indoctrination
� �
� Has principles that advocate a narrow political ideology
� �
� Establishes a divisive us vs. them agenda. Labeling certain ethnic groups exclusively � as victims and others as oppressors can create permanent barriers between
students. Rather than build empathy and community, it is likely to stoke resentment, anger and permanent division.
� �
� Does not include a definition, much less a discussion, of antisemitism
� �
� Does not represent Jews and other minorities accurately. If the ESMC includes � ethnic groups from the Middle East, it should include Mizrahi Jews and other Middle
Eastern communities proportionately. If Middle Eastern communities are considered Asian, then under the "broadly defined umbrella of Asian studies" are Mizrahi Jews and other � ethnic groups from Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which represent ~60% of CA's MENA population (estimated 500,000 Californians)
�
I demand the IQC to revise the Draft further. We must ensure that our children receive the education they deserve. Indoctrination from any angle is not education and this current draft is pure propaganda.
Sincerely,
