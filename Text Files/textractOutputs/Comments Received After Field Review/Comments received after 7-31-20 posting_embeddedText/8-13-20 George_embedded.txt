Dear Commissioners,
Mahalo, my name is Susan Malia George. I live in Vallejo California, born and raised in Oahu, Hawai'i and descended from native Pacific Islanders. Both my mother and grandmother were born and raised on the island of Moloka'i, Hawai'i.
I wish to give immense thanks for your hard work improving the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, especially for your recent inclusion of Pacific Islanders. Our stories, our struggles, our rich oral traditions and contributions must be taught.
However, as someone also with deep ties to the Jewish community, I am concerned that references to Jews remain oriented only around the European diaspora. It is so important that the ESMC makes clear that under the "broadly defined umbrella of Asian Studies" are Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern and North African groups representing 60% of California's MENA population. California Department of Education's Chapter 3 agrees: appropriate topics in the Asian section of Ethnic Studies courses are "the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners." Their stories too must be taught.
Thank you!
Best, Susan Malia George Vallejo, California [phone number redacted]
