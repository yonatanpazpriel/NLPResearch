August 10, 2020 Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I, Philip A Pizzo, MD, appreciate some of the improvements that have been made in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), including the removal of explicitly antisemitic slurs although the anti-Zionist references in some of the footnotes and citations are still deeply distressing. However, I am very concerned by the proposed and I believe still flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Among my major concerns are the misleading references to Mizrahi Jews and Jews of color including the implied favoring of one Middle Eastern community over others. To that regard, the lesson plan "Antisemitism as the Middle Eastern-American Jews that was produced by Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa should be included. With that the ESMC should be revised to represent the cultural and racial diversity of California, including the prevalence of the Mizrahi Jews. Indeed my own genetic roots are tightly tied to these communities.
Accordingly I urge you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Philip A Pizzo, MD
