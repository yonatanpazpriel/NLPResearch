From: sarabjit kaurcheema Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 9:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Request to include Sikh Ethnicity in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Board Members,
My name is Sarabjit Kaur Cheema and I am a Sikh American. I live in Union City. I am an Educator, School Board Member of New Haven USD, serving in my third term. I also am running for Union City Mayor in Nov 2020. I have had three sons go through the California public school system. Learning about Sikhs in ethnic studies is immensely valuable to prepare students for the globalized world. Ethnic Studies takes into account how communities are racialized and impacted by colonization. As the fifth largest world faith/religion, Sikhs are amongst the most visible of minorities, so understanding them will equip students to engage meaningfully with and appreciate the diversity they will encounter. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikh experience in the curriculum.
Sincerely,
Sarabjit Kaur Cheema
