California Board of Education
HI. I have researched your curriculum and I am appalled at the content. This is a total one-sided approach to divide our nation based on color. I am a big admirer of Martin Luther King--he would not support this agenda. Where is a sense of objectivity? Our students need critical thinking skills not brainwashing. It is obvious that you want our students to become left wing radical activists. You do not represent the majority of thinking regarding our constitution, our liberties and our Republic. If this Curriculum is adapted, I will go to every school in our district and demand that they present alternative text books and readings that allow debate and objective understanding. Our founders were not perfect human beings, but they created the best form of government in the world. People of all colors have the ability to be judged by their character not be identified by their skin color. I grew up in a poor Democrat family. We worked very hard and became reasonably successful. You should be ashamed of the type of divisive Marxist philosophy that you are encouraging---and poisoning the youth of our country.
I am encouraging all my friends, contacts and parents of students to respond to your curriculum by sending an e-mail rejecting it as Marxists propaganda.
