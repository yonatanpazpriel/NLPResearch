I am a long time California resident with two children and four grandchildren born and educated in California. I am waiting to urge you to make significant revisions of the ESMC to address my concerns. The ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they are the basis of each unit and lesson plan . As written, they do not reflect California's shared values nor the values laid out in AB 2016. Currently these values and principles promote an "us versus them" agenda and encourage solidarity with BDS and anti-Israel narratives. In addition the second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC from draft 1. The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive with links to group advocacy of virulently anti-Israel pro BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide. I strongly urge you to make significant revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Andrew Lipton
