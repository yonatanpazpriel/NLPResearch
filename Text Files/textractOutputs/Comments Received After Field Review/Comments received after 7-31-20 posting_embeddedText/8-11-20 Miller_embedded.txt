From: Abraham Miller Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members,
As a parent, I am deeply concerned about the anti-Israel, anti-Semitic biases that still hang over the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. The curriculum was ostensibly designed to foster inclusion and understanding; instead, it still fosters exclusion and divisions. I applaud the changes that have been made to date, but schools in our democracy should not be places to foment hatred. Of course, I want an ethnic studies model curriculum in the schools, but one that does not enable those with a divisive agenda to use the schools for indoctrination.
Sincerely yours,
Abraham H. Miller [address redacted] Walnut Creek, California
