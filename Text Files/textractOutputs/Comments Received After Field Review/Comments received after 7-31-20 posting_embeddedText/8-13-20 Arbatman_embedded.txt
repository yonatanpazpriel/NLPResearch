Hi, my name is Natalie Arbatman and I am a Jew from the former Soviet Union. I go to Mountain View High School in Mountain View, CA. Recently, at a conference for teens, I sat at my desk and listened to over 120 Jewish students all around the country recount their experiences with anti-Semitism.
Across California and beyond, teens are forced to confront people who believe not only that they have no right to live in their ancestral homeland of Israel, but that because of their religious or ethnic identity, they deserve ro be ridiculed and threatened. Whether it be their synagogues vandalized with graffiti swastikas, their friends being called "dirty pigs" because they chose to display their Judaism through a Star of David necklace, or having their lives threatened online for posting about their family's safety as rockets fly from Gaza into their neighborhoods, Jewish students face blatant racism everyday.
As a daughter of Soviet Jews, I am beyond grateful to live in America, a place where we can more freely express our culture, opinions, and faith, but I also know we can't take that freedom for granted.
While the ESMC is better than before, it does not represent the full diversity of the Jewish community, including my family's experiences escaping persecution in the Soviet Union. It still leaves room to promote antisemitic agendas in schools. It does not educate about antisemitism in all its forms across the political spectrum, meaning students will not come away with a full understanding of racism in America.
I urge you all to consider the impact this curriculum will have on Jewish students like myself. Please do not let our history be erased, and our present be threatened. Thank you.
