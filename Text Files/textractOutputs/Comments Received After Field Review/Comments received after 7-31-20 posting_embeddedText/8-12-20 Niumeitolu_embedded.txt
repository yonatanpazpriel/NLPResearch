Good morning,
My name is Dr. Fuifuilupe Niumeitolu and I'm a Faculty member in the Department of Gender and Women's Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm writing to humbly inform you that I am interested in making a comment to advocate for Pacific Islander Studies here in California. I will talk about my role as a Tongan/Pacific Islander scholar and educator. I will talk about the importance of PI studies in my own life and its role in creating rehabilitation and healing so that I could graduate with my PhD from UC Berkeley. I will also talk about the important role of PI Studies in my work with PI prisoners, PI communities and I will show the important role of PI Studies in supporting marginalized communities PI LGBTQ. In addition, I will show how PI Studies contributes new and unique methodologies and epistemologies to the diverse social justice organizations here in California. I will show examples of how this work of creating collaborations is thriving, alive and crucial for California.
I am going to be administering final exams here at UC Berkeley on Thursday and will leave class at 2:00PM. I am available to make a public comment at 2:00-5:00PM. My phone number is (510) 9432811.
Very sincerely
Fuifuilupe Niumeitolu PhD Faculty Department of Gender and Women's Studies University of California, Berkeley
