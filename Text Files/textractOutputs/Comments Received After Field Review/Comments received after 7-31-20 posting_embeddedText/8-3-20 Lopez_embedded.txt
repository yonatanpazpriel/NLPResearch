From: Brenda D. Lopez, EdD Sent: Monday, August 3, 2020 10:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Recommendations to Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Hello,
I saw that the CDE recommends that the model curriculum remain rooted in four foundational disciplines of ethnic studies--African American Studies, Asian American Studies, Chicano Latino Studies, and Native American and Indigenous Studies, but I am wondering where and if pacific islanders will be included in the curriculum.
Thank you
