From: Dexter Louie, MD
I am the parent of 4 children who went through the California public school system. I grew up in Chinatown, San Francisco, and went to the public schools. I served on my local school board for 14 years. My father was an immigrant from the farming region in Southern China.
I am very much in favor of an Ethnic Studies Curriculum. The current draft is an improvement over Draft 1, but it can and should be further improved.
I am not in favor of a curriculum that: 1. emphasizes oppression and victimization, 2. is based on racism, indoctrination, and identity politics, and 3. focuses largely on the negative, not the positive.
Our children are easily influenced. They need to be educated, and in a balanced and constructive way. The drafts as proposed fail to educate our children about the histories, customs, beliefs, and achievement of other cultures and societies. There is unmistakable racism, something we are trying now to overcome. There is little emphasis on positive role models.
The model curriculum needs more work and should: 1. teach diversity and inclusiveness in a balanced manner, both the negative and the positive, 2. promote empathy and understanding, 3. and encourage our children in a constructive way.
Respectfully,
Dexter Louie, MD
