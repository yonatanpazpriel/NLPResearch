From: Charlene Woodcock Sent: Wednesday, August 19, 2020 To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American and Pacific Islander Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Greetings.
It is extremely disturbing to learn that Zionist organizations have intervened in the process of revising the California Ethnic Studied Model Curriculum, presuming to dismiss the work of an experienced, hardworking commission and demand the elimination of Arab American and, evidently, Pacific Islander Studies in the curriculum.
I write as a native Californian, a mother and grandmother, and a strong supporter of public education. Especially given the broad diversity of California's population, it is essential that California children learn to understand and respect the native cultures of their schoolmates, including California indigenous culture.
The obvious resolution to this unwarranted intervention is to reconvene the commission of Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers and to recover the work of this commission in order to serve the interests of all Californians. We need Ethnic Studies as it has been developed from 1969, not watered-down multicultural or area studies that pointedly excludes Arab Americans.
Our state government should not be influenced by this sort of programmatic lobbying to serve a single interest group. I have seen this effort at work in driving out of business a media institution that presented a range of voices including both Israeli and Palestinian. The Zionist response was vicious. It should not be tolerated.
Sincerely,
Charlene M. Woodcock Berkeley CA 94709
