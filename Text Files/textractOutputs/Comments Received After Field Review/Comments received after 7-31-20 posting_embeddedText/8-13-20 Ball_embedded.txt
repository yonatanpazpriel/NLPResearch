From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 4:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC),
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I Charna Ball, appreciate the minor attempt to improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), However, I am disturbed by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this Flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns
� �
� Includes one-sided political indoctrination
� � �
� Has principles that advocate a narrow political ideology
� � �
� Establishes a divisive us vs. them agenda. Labeling certain ethnic groups exclusively as victims and others as oppressors can create permanent barriers between students. Rather than build
� empathy and community, it is likely to stoke resentment, anger and permanent division.
� � �
� Does not include a definition, much less a discussion, of antisemitism
� � �
� Does not represent Jews and other minorities accurately. If the ESMC includes ethnic groups from the Middle East, it should include Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern communities proportionately.
� If Middle Eastern communities are considered Asian, then under the "broadly defined umbrella of Asian studies" are Mizrahi Jews and other ethnic groups from Middle East and North Africa (MENA), which represent ~60% of CA's MENA population (estimated 500,000
� Californians)

I am a Californian, a teacher, and a concerned citizen of the USA! I am a person who has taught and coached students from all walks of life.

I have many years of first hand experience with what is in the best interest of a diversified population of students.THIS IS NOT in the best interest of ANY of them. Victimization never is in anyone's best interest. Division is never in the best interest of anyone. One sided dogma is not in their best interest. We are here to educate NOT indoctrinate our future leaders of the Country and world.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
I advise Strongly the IQC to revise the Draft further. We must ensure that our children receive the education they deserve. Indoctrination from any angle is not education and this current draft is pure propaganda.
Thank you, Charna Ball San Francisco,CA Resident Berkeley /Oakland Teacher and Coach.
