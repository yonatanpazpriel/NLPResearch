From: Noah Cohen Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] concern over ECMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I, Noah Cohen, am grateful for some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am still concerned by the currently proposed ESMC.
Here are my issues:
1. Does not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016 2. Partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and
anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students 3. The few references to Jews are are misleading and offensive 4. Needs to include Mizrachi and other Jews of color
As a middle school history teacher at a local private school, I am aware of how important standards are in guiding me in what material I am expected to cover, as well as the various perspectives students need to hear in order to draw educated conclusions. It's imperative that young people have a clear, honest, and unbiased account of all ethnic studies perspectives. 
I ask you to make revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Noah Cohen
