From: Philip Bowles Sent: Monday, August 31, 2020 12:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed changes to history curriculum
I realize that the passage of time requires us to reevaluate history. That does not mean replacing one outdated view with a new inaccurate one. The majorly of our high school graduates do not even know the basic facts (not opinions) about the Constitution, how legislation is made, nor can they recognize the names of more than a handful of US Presidents. They can wait until college to major in Grievance Studies or whatever fad they care to go into debt to learn. Just do the job that my elementary school did for me before you It your creative talents to work generating young adults brimming with resentment, excuses, and entitlement. Sincerely, Philip Bowles San Francisco
