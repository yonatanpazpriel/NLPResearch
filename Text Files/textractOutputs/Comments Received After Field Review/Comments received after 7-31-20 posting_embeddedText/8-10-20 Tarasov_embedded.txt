Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I Isaak Tarasov, appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns: � ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they are the basis of each unit and lesson plan. � The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC's first draft. � The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. � References to Middle Eastern communities should not favor one community over others. � The ESMC should be revised to accurately and equitably represent the cultural and racial diversity of California so it is balanced, as required by SBE standards and ESMC Guidelines. I am a grandfather of 4 kids I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Isaak Tarasov Hayward, CA
