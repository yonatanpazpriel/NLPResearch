Dear IQC Members:
Can you please consider my comments below on the ESMC?. I am a resident of San Francisco and parent of a 16-year old student..
I am happy that the CDE is planning to make significant changes to the ESMC. The updated new draft is in a promising direction, Can the CDE please consider making further changes to address the following issues in the curriculum.
� Chapter 1 includes a section titled "Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies." These Guiding Values and Principles directly reference and are partly based on a book called Education at War. This book has portions that can be interpreted as anti-semetic and anti-Israel. It encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, which would be deeply disturbing to many Jewish students.
� In Chapter 3, Middle Eastern communities, such as Mizrahi Jews, Iranians, Kurds, AssyrianChristians, Coptic-Christians, Yezidis, Baha'is, and Zorastrians, are lumped together as "other Middle Easterners." Can they instead be represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans?
� In Chapter 3, references to American Jewish experiences. Can this chapter also include the experiences of Moroccan, Mizrahi Jews, Jews of color, Jews from the former Soviet Union, and other Jewish communities in California?
� The only unit included in Appendix A that places significant focus on Jews compares them to Irish Americans. Why is this comparison only to Irish Americans? This unit also disregards the diversity of the American Jewish community.
Thank you for considering my comments.
Regards, Harold Tuchfeld
