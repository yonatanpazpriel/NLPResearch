From: Winty Singh Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 3:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is a copy of my testimony for the IQC meeting held on Thursday August 13th 2020. Agenda item 2.A.
My name is Winty Singh and I am a Sikh in Elk Grove, California. As a community advocate, I have run countless trainings for educators, who share that it is eye opening to learn so much about their Sikh students. Community members should not be expected to bridge this gap. It is the responsibility of the CDE. Teachers cannot teach about Sikhism without the right curriculum and training. I saw last night that lesson plans have been added about the Arab American and Pacific Islander communities. This is a positive step and I would like to ask why our sample lesson plan about Sikhs, and the petition signed by 1220 community members continues to be ignored?
The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach aboutthe positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC iswilling to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
Thank you.
Winty Singh
