From: Claire Urbanski Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 8:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please keep Arab American and Pacific Islander Studies in the ESMC
Hello,
I am a doctoral candidate and instructor in the Feminist Studies and Critical Race and Ethnic Studies Departments at the University of California, Santa Cruz. I am writing to please implore you to keep both Pacific Islander Studies and Arab American Studies in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As an instructor of Critical Race and Ethnic Studies, of Indigenous and Native American Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, I can speak from my own knowledge and experience of how important Pacific Islander Studies and Arab American Studies are to any curriculum covering United States history and its socio-cultural, political, economic dynamics and relations. Especially on the Pacific Coast and in the state of California, Pacific Islander Studies is extremely vital and tremendous to the formation of the West Coast states, both historically and in its contemporary context. One cannot teach an indigenous history of the United States, nor a history of United States political and economic relations without Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies. To remove these from the ESMC means removing and erasing entire rich, complex, dynamic, lively narratives, movements, histories, and relations, without which, students will have such a major gap in their perspectives of the world they live in - on a local and global scale. Thank you for your time.
Sincerely, Claire Urbanski
