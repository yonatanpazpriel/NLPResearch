From: Greg Sokol Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 6:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC2 concerns
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am deeply concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns (take examples from the email:
- advocate a narrow political philosophy - establish an "us vs them" agenda - partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to all Jewish students
I am a Californian and a parent of 2 girls. Biased and anti-israeli curriculum will create an unwelcoming and even unsafe environment for my kids.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
-Greg Sokol, Pleasanton, CA
