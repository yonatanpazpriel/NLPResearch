From: Emily Hirsekorn Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 8:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Committee:
I am a mother of two preschool-aged children in San Diego and a law school administrator. I am Jewish, as is my entire family. We have a nearby neighbor who drives around with swastika flag on the truck, a former client of mine in the legal industry used to make offense comments about Jews, and we live with ongoing news of planned attacks on the religious institutions we frequent.
While I have always considered myself politically progressive, it's becoming harder and harder with "progressive" activists conflating anti-Israel sentiment with anti-Jewish sentiment. More and more Jewish people, including students, are being pushed out of spaces in student government, local government, and activist groups. Please make sure the ethnic studies curriculum presents an UNBIASED view of conflicts in the Middle East as well as presents the history of Jewish people accurately, including Jewish people of color. It is imperative now more than ever that we emphasize how to help each other, not tear us apart.
Thank you for your time, Emily Hirsekorn
