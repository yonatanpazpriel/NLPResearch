Hello,
I am a voter and parent in Arcata CA., 95521.
I appreciate your improvement of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Thank you.
Please make further revisions to address these concerns:
Revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and ensure critical thinking.
It is important not to pit one group against another but to teach children to create a society of diversity inclusion and tolerance of ALL minority groups, racial, religious, cultural, gender, etc.
My children were raised in a rural area with a Jewish lesbian mom and happily, in their lifetimes, attitudes about LGBT have improved-- but tragically, antisemitic violent incidents have increased terribly. They now attend a synagogue with security guards, even in our small town. It is very important to include antisemitism as an important "ism" or "phobia" that students should learn about as an example of bullying, discrimination and hatred.
Thank you, Jerryl Lynn Rubin
