[contact information redacted] August 6, 2020 The Instructional Quality Commission California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814-5901 To the Commission: As a longtime Californian, a Jew and the parent of a student attending a UC school, I need to make comment regarding changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I am outraged that you include the language Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege. Am I correct that you are teaching children that this so called "racial privilege" is a given and not to be challenged? If that is so, every non-Jewish student in this state will grow up to look upon every Jew as having such privileges due to their faith and not "the content of their character. I thought the whole point was to eliminate such stereotypes. This is consistent with the "Blame the Jews" mentality that has plagued us for thousands of years. I implore you to rethink this. Finally, having been married to a first-generation Irish American for 27 years, lumping Irish and Jewish Americans demonstrates an alarming misunderstanding of the two cultures. Please reconsider this entire concept. I am more than happy to provide you with deeper insight.
Sincerely, Ken Ferber
