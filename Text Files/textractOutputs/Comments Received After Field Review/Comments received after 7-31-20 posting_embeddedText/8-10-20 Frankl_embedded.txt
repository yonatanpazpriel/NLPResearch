From: Adam Frankl Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 1:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Issues with ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate the improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am a Californian parent, veteran, and small business owner. Educating everyone on the truth of ethnic studies is essential.
Here are my major concerns:
ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they are the basis of each unit and lesson plan. They: o do not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016 o advocate a narrow political philosophy o establish an "us vs them" agenda o are from the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students
I ask you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Adam Frankl, Hillsborough CA
