Dear CDE Ethic Studies Curriculum development team,
Many thanks for listening to the first round of community feedback on the draft curriculum. As a California resident with a Jewish heritage, I am grateful you have investigated and then removed any anti-Semitic language in the draft.
I would urge you to ensue our students learn the essential skills of critical thinking and investigation, that can cut through the hot-button issues, to go several layers deep in any issue, to find a deeper understanding of the truth.
I urge you to include essential fact-finding tools to help students cut through the mass of internet-based falsehoods, to arrive at the much more satisfying truth.
And a section on "Reconciliation" is helpful to point students towards the love and understanding needed to bridge centuries-long multi-etnic conflicts. Of course, reconciliation can take many trajectories; reconciliation ITSELF is rooted in ethnic diversity. Judeo-Christian Torah-/Bible-based reconciliation is also a very valid and useful model to teach on today's world.
Thank you all again for listening.
-David Abramsky Concord CA
