To whom it may concern:
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) needs revision. It does not reflect the values laid out in AB 2016, including "the objective of preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures." Instead, this curriculum adopts a divisive tone as opposed to the inclusiveness mandated by the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines.
California students need to be exposed to multiple perspectives. They need to be taught to think critically so they can form their own opinions on difficult, complex issues. Our students need a curriculum that encourages the building of empathy and community.
Thank you for your continued work to ensure that California students have the best possible ethnic studies curriculum.
Sincerely,
Kirby Conrad Retired teacher, Los Altos School District
