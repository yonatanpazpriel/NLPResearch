From: Jawad Frangieh Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 9:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment Re: Save Arab American Studies
Dear CA Board of Education IQC,
As an Arab-American educator, I support ESMC including Arab American studies. The reasons are simple:
1. Data shows that students who study Ethnic Studies demonstrate an increase in academic achievement and positive behavior in schools.
2. We cannot let our Arab American students remain invisible by excluding Arab American studies in curriculum, especially given the discrimination that Arabs and Arab Americans face in the U.S. Our voices need to be heard, our contributions need to be acknowledged, and our histories and current realities need to be taught in public schools.
Any revisions affecting Arab American studies should be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners, to ensure accuracy and positive representation in the curriculum.
Thank you for considering these points.
In solidarity, Jawad Frangieh
