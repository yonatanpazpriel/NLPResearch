From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 7:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] public comment -
To the CDE:
I wish to comment on the proposed ethnic studies curriculum.
The idea of learning about other ethnicities is good, useful and would be informative to California students.
But limiting the ethnicities to a chosen few, and then inserting partisan political and ideological content into the ethnic studies curriculum, while denigrating and stereotyping other races and ethnicities, particularly the white community, as though all the same, while also denigrating our system of government, denigrating our economic system, capitalism, and denigrating our country, its founders, and the founding principles of our country, is, in my view, crossing the line, is incredibly divisive, and, in my view, extremely inappropriate in a tax payer financed forum, as a required course in CA public schools.
Please remove all partisan and ideological and racist and inflammatory content from the ethnic studies curriculum.
Thank you.
Best,
Kathy Jordan
