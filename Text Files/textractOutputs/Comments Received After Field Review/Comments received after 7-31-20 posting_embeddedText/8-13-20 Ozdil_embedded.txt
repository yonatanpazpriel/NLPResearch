I am an immigrant Turkish Jew with a proud family history that I can trace hundreds of years back in Turkey. Living as a minority and often under persecution has been a part of my indigeneous community's identity for millennia so you can imagine education and normalization of minority groups in the region is of utmost importance to me.
All of us dealing with ethnic studies believe that education makes a difference or we wouldn't care to engage with the topic. However, it would be remiss not to mention that education has also been used in negative ways in countless ways to indoctrinate populations-- Marxism being a standout example.
So if we can all agree education matters and that it can cause blowback on communities if not done right, my first question is: What is the rush to institute the curriculum as it is? Isn't getting it right important? I heard a gentleman representing the curriculum on the IQC call saying he wants to move forward with it as it is. How is this yet justified when so many voices from different groups feel misrepresented?
Secondly, criticising BDS in American curriculum is not suppressing Arab Americans voices. BDS is a movement based on misinformation that wrongly conflates the Palestinian narrative with American civil rights movements. That is not academic, that is propaganda.
Teach, don't preach.
