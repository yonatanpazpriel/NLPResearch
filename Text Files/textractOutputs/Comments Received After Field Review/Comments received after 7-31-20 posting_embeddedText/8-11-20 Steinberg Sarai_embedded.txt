From: Sarai Steinberg Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 7:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concern over the current draft of ESMC
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education --
I was glad to see some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am very concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in the current draft.
My major concerns are that the curriculum is partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and links with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives. This is harmful to many Jewish students -- and directly affect me and my family, as three out of the five of us have dual U.S. and Israeli citizenship. The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. and link to anti-Israel, pro-BDS sites. Also, please Include a lesson plan covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience.
As a Hispanic Jew and rising high school senior, I know the power that education and its narratives hold -- both in mind, in heart, and in action. Please consider your responsibility and its consequences, both positive and negative.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
