From: Roneta Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
My name is Roneta Dickey, and I am a California resident, voter and parent.
I am concerned that the second draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, although improved, is still seriously flawed. The ESMC is one-sided and divisive. It identifies certain ethnic groups exclusively as victims and others as oppressors. It does not include a definition of antisemitism, which is the #1 religious hate crime in the U.S. It is essential that students learn to understand each other and work together cooperatively. The ESMC will not further this goal.
The ESMC should be revised to accurately and fairly represent California's racial and cultural diversity as required by SBE standards and ESMC Guidelines.
Thank you for your consideration.
