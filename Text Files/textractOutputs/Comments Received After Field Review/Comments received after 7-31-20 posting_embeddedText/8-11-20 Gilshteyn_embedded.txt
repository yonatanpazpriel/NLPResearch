Hello to whom it may concern,
Thank you you very much for implementing a change to the ethnic studies curriculum. Most of the explicit anti-Semitic and anti-Iarael content were removed. Some additional guidance has been added to encourage teachers to expose students to "multiple often competing sources of information," and offer respect for diverse viewpoints, rather than promote a particular political or ideological view.
The ESMC should better represent me as a Jew whose parents immigrated after the world war 2. My grandma's grandmother was an orthodox jewish person with 16 children who she sent to Hebrew school. She was then murdered in a pogrom with her husband, and my grandmother's mother was sent to an orphanage with no more hebrew education. My grandmother was still born Jewish without being taught Hebrew and had to hide her Jewishness while growing up in Russia. Her children also grew up in Russia and had to hide their Jewishness. I am also born Jewish even though much of my ethnicty has been erased by Russian culture. This education program nonviolently perpetuates my ethnic cleansing by teaching children that I am not born jewish and that I am white culture or ethnicty because of my skin color. I want to indentify as Jewish, not white. I am unqiue from other Jewish immigrants and there are many other types of diaspora Jews in the united states.
Please listen to us because this rhetoric makes people hate us jews and Anti-Semitic hate crimes have increased 72% since 2016. Jews remain the number 1 target of Hate crimes in the United States and the number 3 target of hate crimes in California.
Humble regards, Nina Gilshteyn
