Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,
Please consider the following suggestions to improve the proposed ethnic studies curriculum.
A "General Principle" in the "Model Curriculum Guidelines" should include a goal that the students appreciate why democracy and capitalism are better than marxism, socialism, and facism. That in spite of all the failures studied in our history. This can be accomplished by including in the study materials:
1. The failure of modern day Venezuela. Contrasting democracy/capitalism and socialism. 2. The dictatorship in Cuba and how the citizens suffer under the Castros'. 3. Modern slavery in China, Eritrea, and the Central African Republic. Children should be
aware that the USA leads the world today in trying to eradicate slavery. 4. Celebrate through study entrepreneurs like Martha De La Torre and Herman Cain;
as examples. The list can be extensive and impressive.
Augment or replace the current section on "Self and collective empowerment" with teaching The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz. I have presented these materials to children/teenagers detained in juvenile hall and the materials are very well received. Frankly, the current materials are too politically focused, with all due respect. The Four Agreements will empower the children in all aspects of their lives.
If our children understand the horrible mistakes made in our country through the study of history but still love our country in spite of its mistakes and current challenges and feel empowered then the program will be a success.
