From: Sidney Orr Sent: Monday, August 3, 2020 11:18 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] The concept of "ethnic studies" - as to be taught in Calif schools
The whole concept is disingenuous, deeply-racist, and obviously antisemitic. Its a transparent enterprise of the left.
There are already many educational venues, perhaps countless such venues for study of the concept. The question is not whether "ethnic studies"per se, its whether the CDE is an appropriate channel. Its certainly not. Please cease work on such gratuitous, wasteful, uninformed, incompetent, and biased "curricula".
Has anyone at CDE observed that the quality of elementary and secondary education in California, for the past several decades, has declined, by any measure? Initiatives to study ethnicity are one of the reasons.

I'm a product of Calif schools, and higher education (UCLA, Stanford), and have raised children, who have gone through Calif schools. The education they were offered is not exactly the quality of what was offered to myself. An understatement.
