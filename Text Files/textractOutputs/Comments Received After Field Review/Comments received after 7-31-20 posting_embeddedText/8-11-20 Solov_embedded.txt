From: Jo Ann Solov Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 2:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am JoAnn Solov, a parent and grandparent, concerned about the removal of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the revision of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. They should both remain as essential components.
As a reformed Jew and retired teacher, I regret that this education has not been included in the high school curriculum over the course of my life. Living in the multicultural city of Sacramento, it is essential for students to be aware of the diverse backgrounds, histories and conflicts that have brought us to the current fractures in our communities. Xenophophia, Islamophobia and anti-semitism need to be included within the framework of the curriculum. As difficult and complex as it is, the Israeli Palestinian conflict needs to be addressed. I am proud to contribute to a variety of organizations working to bring peace, dignity and equality to this region.
It's never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is. The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as "vectors" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point to the need for anti-racist education: All students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.
We must illuminate the rainbow that is our world with a bold curriculum that is not watered down. The current state of our country makes this an urgent issue.
Thank you for your diligence in working on this project.
