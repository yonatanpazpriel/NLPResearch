From: Lori Krauss Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I, Lori Krauss appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am greatly upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns (take examples from the email: The misrepresentations of Jewish people and other ethnic groups One sided ideology and pandering to communities who don't "like those that are not like them".
I am a California attorney, parent, and atheist. With the rise of hate crimes, anti-Semitism and toxic political environment, I cannot see how this biased curriculum will help reduce the hate.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Lori Krauss- Saratoga, CA
