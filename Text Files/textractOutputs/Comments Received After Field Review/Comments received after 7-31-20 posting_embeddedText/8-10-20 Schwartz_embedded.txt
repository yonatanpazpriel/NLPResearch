From: Schwartz Rochelle Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns: -Misrepresentation of Jews and other ethnic groups -Anti-zionist references remain in footnotes, links, & bibliography -Imposing a one-sided political idealogy -The experiences of Mizrahi Jews, Kurds. Assyrian Christians & other immigrant communities are not represented on an equal basis with Arab Americans, and just mentioned as other Middle Easterners
I am a California teacher and parent and I have personal experiences seeing how uncomfortable students have been in history classes when the teachers have belittled and misrepresented the history of students' ethnic identity or their religious group, on a daily basis. I have had former students and their parents contact me for help in how to deal with these horrible situations. It is the job of our education system to promote and foster respect for diverse viewpoints and teach tolerance and not promote hatred. I am pleased to see the removal of explicit antisemitic and anti-Zionism slurs and the inclusion of an identity unit in the instructional guidelines.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Rochelle Schwartz
