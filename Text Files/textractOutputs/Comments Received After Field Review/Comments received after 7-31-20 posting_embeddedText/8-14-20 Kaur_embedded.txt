From: Inderpreet Kaur Sagoo Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 10:25 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is a copy of my testimony for the IQC meeting held on Thursday August 13th 2020. Agenda item 2.A.
� My name is Inderpreet Kaur and I am a Sikh.
� I was pleased to see the press release yesterday that two additional lesson plans on the Pacific Islander community and Arab American Studies will be added. I would like to ask why a lesson about the Sikh community has not also been added despite our petition signed by 1220 people and the submission of a sample lesson plan. I was born and raised in LA and went through the public school system in LAUSD. I faced bullying and harassment because of my religious identity - my peers were not aware of the positive contributions Sikhs have made over the last 125 years. Half of the 500,000 Sikhs in the US live in California, the first Sikh Gurdwara, or house of worship, in the US is in Stockton. Dalip Singh Saund, from California, was the first Asian American to serve in Congress. These contributions must be included in the curriculum through a lesson plan also.
The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
