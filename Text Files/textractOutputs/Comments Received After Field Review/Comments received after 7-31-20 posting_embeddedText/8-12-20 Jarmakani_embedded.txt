Greetings California Educational Officials,
I write to you concerning the omission of Arab American and Pacific Islander Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum. I write to you as a retired CA nurse, mother and grandmother of students in CA schools and as a resident of Hawaii. We live in an age of increasing insensitivity and ignorance regarding our cultural and racial diversity. I have witnessed the lack of understanding among many Americans of the culture of the Arab American and Pacific Islanders. Including these ethnic groups in our education is essential in furthering better understanding. I request that you:
1. Reconvene the original committee of Ethnic Studies who are the experts in this field.
2. Pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines and includes Palestine in the Arab American studies.
3. Please do not divert to another field but maintain in the Ethnic Studies framework with disciplinary knowledge, language and pedagogy.
4. I'm requesting work within clearcut structures for accountability.,transparency, and consensus building. Center the structures on Ethnic Studies of communities of color and Native peoples throughout the process.
I appreciate your attention to this educational concern.
