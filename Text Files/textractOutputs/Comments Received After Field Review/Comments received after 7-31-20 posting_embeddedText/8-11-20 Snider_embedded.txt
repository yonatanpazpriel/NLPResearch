I am a citizen of California, residing in San Mateo. I am disturbed by reports I read about some of the language in the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Judaism is the religion of Jewish Peoplehood. It is an ancient religion. Its tenets are prescribed in the canon of its scripture. In modern times these tenets are often referred to (in a manner which seems to me as more than slightly ironic) as "Judeo-Christian values."
Academia should study Jewish history in the light of these tenets, It is not fair to categorize the Jewish people according to attributes and labels constructed by others.
Sincerely,
Yash Snider
