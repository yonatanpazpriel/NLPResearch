From: Roger Lazarus Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:34 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Input to ESMC deliberations
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am most concerned based on the coverage I have read on the deliberations for an ethnic studies curriculum that the proposed guidelines have the potential to reinforce differences and enhance prejudices. We aspire to develop a diverse and fair society where each person is judged for who they are and not for their ancestors history or faith. The broad principles create the risk of - or worse allow the opportunity for - the teaching of ignorant and bigoted content, allow for the teaching of woke politics and worst ï¿½ creating a sense of victimhood in each community Rather, we must educate our youth to understand the multi-cultural foundations of our country. We learn from history by accepting, growing and being together as Americans.
Sincerely
Roger A. Lazarus
