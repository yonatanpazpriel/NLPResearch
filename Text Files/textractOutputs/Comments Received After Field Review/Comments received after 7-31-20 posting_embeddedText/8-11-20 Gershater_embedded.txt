Dear Commission,
Thank you for your hard work in these trying times. I am very pleased to see significant improvements in California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum recommendations that were made public last week.
I hope that you will continue to improve the curriculum, as follows. The curriculum must fully represent the ethnic diversity of the Jewish community, particularly Jews of Color and Jews whose families originate from the Middle East, as well as other minorities represented in California's population. Additional lesson material on contemporary antisemitism is necessary, within the body of the curriculum, for a fuller understanding of racism and discrimination in America, (particularly in light of the fact that hate crimes against Jews have risen by 71% since 2016, and Jews continue to be the #1 targets of religious based hate crimes in California). Additional safeguards, such as adding Los Angeles Unified School District Balanced Curriculum guidelines, are still needed to discourage political bias in classrooms.
I look forward to seeing continued improvement!
Regards,
