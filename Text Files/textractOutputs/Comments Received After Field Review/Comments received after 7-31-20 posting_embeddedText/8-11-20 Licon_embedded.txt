Hello,
Asian Pacific Islander and Arab Studies must be restored to the ethnic studies curriculum as originally drafted.
I was there at the daily picket lines during the Berkeley Third World Liberation Front strike. That pioneering, and now widely honored ,movement's achievements was born of much sacrifice and blood. Yes blood ,as I personally witnessed the blood flowing from the heads of people beaten at the picket lines. That sacrifice is being disrespected by such a removal of Pacific Islander/Arab studies. As academics is being disrespected by the surrendering to political lobbying.
