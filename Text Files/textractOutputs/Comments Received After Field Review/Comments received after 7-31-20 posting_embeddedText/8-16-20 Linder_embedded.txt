From: Alison Linder Sent: Sunday, August 16, 2020 11:03 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
Hi, I wanted to add some of my thoughts to the discussion on the ethnic studies curriculum. I understand that the point is to to lift up the least privileged people of color in the state. I think it is important to address the structural and historic features that institutionalize racism and lack of opportunity in the four groups offocus. I also encourage a discussion of how capitalism is flawed in leading to these outcomes.
I also feel that other groups are marginalized and subject to hate and discrimination, and violence and this should not be ignored. In particular, anti-Semitism is still strong and Jews are often scapegoated and blamed for societies problems,resulting in violence and vandalism against the community. The history of the holocaust, and formation of Israel as a direct result of the horror of the holocaust should be included.
I am also resharing some points from the Israeli-American council, which I feel are valid and should be considered. I feel particularly strongly about points 4, 5 and 6.
Thank you for your consideration.
1. I commend the CDE for including "the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence" as a topic for study in the ESMC. I believe this should beedited to say "the recent rise in anti-Semitic violence and hatred", to ensure discussions include antisemitic harassment, vandalism, discrimination, and rhetoric which may not fit within the category of "violence". (Page 20, Lines 527-528)
2. Instead of providing clear definitions for the terms mentioned in the "Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies", the ESMC includesfootnotes for educators to delve deeper into the sources of such terms on their own. Sources mentioned include Maira and Shihade (2006) and Spade (2011), which lead educators to connect social movement principles with the BDS movement. This citation refersto Israel as a "Settler-colonial" state, connects anti-Zionism in the Middle East to anti-racism and anti-imperialist movements in the U.S., and attacks the CDE's partner organization, the ADL.
By not accurately defining these terms within the ESMC, educators will follow the terminology of these problematic references mentionedin the citations, ultimately promoting the hateful content originally removed from the first draft of the ESMC. (Page 9, Lines 179-194).
3. I commend CDE for adding language about transparency and public input regarding the development of local ethnic studies curriculums aswell as encouraging the exploration of "multiple and often competing sources of information". I urge you to strongly emphasize this point in communications to local schoolboards as well as communicate that educators refrain from conveying their own politicalviews and potential biases. (Pages 5, 10, 11)
4. "Students will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege." (Page 6, Line 8166-67)
1.Targeted Jewish communitiesall across America are currently dealing with antisemitism through the spread of the belief that Jews are responsible for racial and financial inequalities in

America. Such a chapter falsely representing the Jewish American narrative would only promote suchantisemitic rhetoric and instill such ideology. 2. This prompt leads students to the assumption that all Jews are white, rather than taking into consideration the vast Mizrahi Jewishimmigrant population that hailed from Arab countries as a result of persecution as well as Black Jews, Spanish Jews, Latino Jews, and Jews form North Africa. 3. Also, the reference to "white" Jews (those from Eastern Europe) does not mention that these very "white" Jews are still targeted todayin the U.S. by white nationalists and other groups who carry out antisemitic violence. The victims of recent synagogue attacks were murdered because of the perpetrators' perceptions that they are non-white and are enemies of the "white race." Irish Americanstoday do not face this kind of violence by white supremacists.
5. "the unique experiencesof Arabs and other Middle Easterners" should include Mizrahi Jews. By not doing so the ESMC will be erasing the narrative of non-Arab and non-Muslim ethnic and religious groups from the Middle East who form the Middle Eastern immigrant communities in America. (Page 20, Lines 527-528)
6. Given the problems listedabove, this should not be the only example of a unit covering the experiences of Jewish Americans that teachers have access to in the ESMC. At minimum, the following materials should be included as well: (Page 6, Lines 8159-69) Antisemitismand Middle Eastern-American Jews, 9ï¿½12 JewishAmerican Studies Course Outline: The Jewish American Experience in the United States and California
