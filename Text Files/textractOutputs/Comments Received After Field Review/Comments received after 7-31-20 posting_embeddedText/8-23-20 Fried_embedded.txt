I am shocked and disgusted that the state of California will be teaching anti-Semitism to it's students. Is this pre World War 2 in Germany, Poland and Austria? You will be indoctrinating young minds to be antiSemitic just as Hitler did with his Hitler youth organizations.I am nauseated over this reprehensible act! I hope my grand children do not grow up in California and be victims of state sponsored anti-Semitism. God will punish you in time. I do not know how you can live with yourselves knowing the false propaganda you will be instilling into young minds. SHAME ON YOU!!!
