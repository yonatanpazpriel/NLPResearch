Dear Colleagues,
Hï¿½fa adai and greetings. My name is Keith L. Camacho, and I am a professor in the Asian American Studies Department at the University of California, Los Angeles.

I am now writing to support the addition of new faculty, curricula, and related resources for the teaching of Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies (and ethnic studies in its entirety) in the K-12 system of California.
