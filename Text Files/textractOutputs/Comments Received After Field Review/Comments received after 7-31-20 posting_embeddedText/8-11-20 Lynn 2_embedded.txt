please also include
� comparisons between violent and nonviolent action groups, � the amount of damage to property (monetary) as well as physical damage in any
examples you give to students � include any suggestions by Chief James Craig of Detroit police, they have been
quite successful � include any suggestions from former sheriff of Milwaukee David Clarke, also
successful � include failures of leadership, both local and federal. note that the Black Lives
Matter started in response to a case that occurred when Barack Obama was president. With better leadership, this could have been nonviolent. � note the results of the federal investigations at Fergusson and other places in terms of findings of wrongdoing or innocence of the police

With kind regards, Judith Lynn
