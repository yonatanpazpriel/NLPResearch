From: Barbara Schapira Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please continue to improve the ESMC
To: Ethnic Studies Committee:
I am a former special education teacher, affirmative action professional, parent and now grandparent. I am most concerned that the revised ESMC, even though much improved, does not meet the high standards and qualities that will inform and enrich our students to be open minded, critical thinkers and better informed about the diversity of CA. In our current fractured society, it is even more important than ever that a course does NOT advocate such a narrow political view.
Major concerns: *There are links to and group advocacy of virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with
malicious slander about imaginary genocide *Jews of color not included, major concern in our current times of the need for improved
racial justice *Jews from Arab countries need to be included-not all Arabs are Moslem * It is crucial to include the stores of the 60% of CA's MENA population (est at 500,00
Californians). References to Middle Eastern people need to include Mizrahi Jews, Coptic Christians, Kurds, Iranians, Assyrians and other minority groups from the region.
*A lesson plan needs to be included that addresses contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry and the Middle Eastern-Jewish Experience.
*Having had family murdered in the Holocaust, I am very concerned about the report of the 2018 CA Hate Crime Statistics that hate crimes against Jews increased by over 20% while Anti-Muslim bias evens decreased by more than 40%. Students need to learn about both Islamophobia and Antisemitism in an ethnic studies framework.
I know you do understand the importance of having a balanced, informative and thoughtful educational experience for all our students. Our state will be better for this experience if the ESMC addresses the glaring weaknesses, biases and omissions.
Thank you. Barbara Schapira Sunnyvale
