From: D Dorenz Sent: Monday, August 24, 2020 11:30 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on the ESMC
Dear Dept of Education and the Ethnic Studies Curriculum Committee:
� All references to Middle Eastern people in the curriculum should include, specifically name, and teach on the diverse groups of Mizrahi Jews, Coptic Christians, Kurds, Iranians, Assyrians, and other minority groups from the region who together represent 60% of California's Middle Eastern population and have asked for inclusion. In order for the curriculum to avoid an essentialist understanding of Arabs and the Middle East, and in order to be well balanced, each group should be equally and equitably represented in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. All units and lesson plans referencing any Middle Eastern group should be titled either "Middle Eastern-Americans" or "Southwest Asians and North African � Americans."
� I would like to see the next draft of the curriculum include the lesson plan, "Antisemitism and Middle Eastern-American Jews" produced by the organization, JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa, as it will provide students with highquality instruction on contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience.
� The ESMC should make clear that under the "broadly defined umbrella of Asian Studies" are Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) groups which represent ~60% of CA's MENA population. California Department of Education's Chapter 3 agrees: appropriate topics in the Asian section of Ethnic Studies courses are "the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners."
Sincerely, -Dorothea Dorenz
