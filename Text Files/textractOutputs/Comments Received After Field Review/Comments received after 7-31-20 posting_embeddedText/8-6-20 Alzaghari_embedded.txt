From: Iman A. Sent: Wednesday, August 5, 2020 10:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment: Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello,
I am a lifelong California resident and am proud to have been educated through the California public education system.
I am emailing to voice my support for Arab American studies. As the daughter of Palestinian immigrants in the Bay Area, I cannot stress enough the importance of ethnic studies curriculum to California students. Students of color deserve to see themselves in the school curriculum. All students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.
Ethnic Studies is now under threat, as there is an organized effort to remove Arab American studies from the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Especially during this time, in which Arab Americans are facing increased racism, Islamophobia, and bigotry from the federal administration, it is unacceptable that outside interest groups are promoting that same racism and trying to remove Arab American studies from California schools.
I would like to reiterate that it is integral at this time to include West Asian American experiences in the ESMC. Furthermore it is important to include the history and current struggles in Palestine be included in the curriculum.
Thank you,
Iman Alzaghari
