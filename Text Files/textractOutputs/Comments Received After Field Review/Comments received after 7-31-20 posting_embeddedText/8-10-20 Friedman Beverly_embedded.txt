> There has been some improvement in the proposed curriculum but there are still many concerns. We must have an approach which is both respectful of our history and inclusive regarding all of our minority communities. There is no call for discriminating, or marginalizing, or singling out for derision or prejudice against any group. Helping all groups feel respected is not congruent with prejudice against or radical defining of any other group, especially the the Jewish people of California both past and present. Middle Eastern and North African Jews as well as Jews emigrating from Israel are just as worthy of respect as all other minority groups that seem to be the focus of the proposed curriculum. Please consider these principles when finalizing this significant development in our schools. There should be factual information, not political opinions.
Sincerely, Beverly Friedman
