To the Instructional Quality Commission,
I, as a High School teacher who has taught World History and am of native Hawaiian decent have long been shocked by the lack of Pacific Island History and culture in our curriculum. At the high school level this consists of a few paragraphs in our history books.
For example: that Hawai'i was a constitutional monarchy internationally recognized and developed to the point that it had a higher literacy rate than the US, and a capital (Honolulu) with street cars and electricity before most American cities did is known to very few in California.
Pacific islanders may have one of the smallest populations in the world and are perhaps the smallest minority in the US but they deserve representation.
As an 30+ year teaching veteran and active member of the LA Pacific Islander community I offer to you my assistance in this effort
