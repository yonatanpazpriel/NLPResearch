From: jd phillips Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:44 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Jenna Phillips, and I was one of the original members of the Curriculum Committee for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I have been in education for over 16 years in roles as a classroom teacher and instructional coach.
I urge you to not adopt the model curriculum in its current form. The current draft of the model curriculum does not include critical segments of the current Ethnic Studies
community, specifically Arab American and Pacific Islanders. Also, the lesson plan on the Cambodian American community has been removed. The revised draft is also missing information classroom teachers need to develop lesson plans, including the Ethnic Studies Guiding Principles, the glossary, significant historical
figures, and other removed sections. I hope that the original material will be returned to the curriculum or that the original committee will be able to continue its work to create a model curriculum that is authentically centered in Ethnic Studies and is a true resource to classroom teachers.
Thank you for considering my comments, Jenna Phillips
