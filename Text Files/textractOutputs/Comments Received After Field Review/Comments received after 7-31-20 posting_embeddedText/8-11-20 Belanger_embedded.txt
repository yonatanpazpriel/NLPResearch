From: danielle luz belanger Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment for 8/13 IQC Meeting
My name is Danielle Luz Belanger and I've been a resident of California for 27 years. As a community organizer, archivist, and graduate student, my work centers the need to preserve and visibilize underrepresented histories. This task should not fall on the shoulders of a few individuals--education about histories of oppressed peoples across the world should be normalized in public schools to provide our youth with knowledge that is directly relevant to their lives. I commend the California Board of Education for their initial efforts in addressing this need by forming a committee to author an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) for California youth (grades 7-12). However, the revised ESMC raises some serious concerns and contradictions that threaten to undermine the original gains made by the BOE.
The California Board of Education has a responsibility to lift up marginalized and oppressed histories, rather than participate in the perpetuation of their erasure. I urge the Instructional Quality Commission to include Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander studies in the Ethnic Studies curriculum, without which the integrity of the discipline will be compromised.
As a publicly funded project, the IQC must also be accountable to revealing the identities of those who authored the revised ethnic studies curriculum. We residents of California have a right to know who is shaping and defining ethnic studies.
Thank you.
