From: Jasmine Kaur Sent: Saturday, August 15, 2020 6:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Jasmine Kaur and I am a SIKH AMERICAN. I have been through the LAUSD school system and am pursuing a Masters in Public Policy at USC.
Having grown up and not seen Sikhism accurately or effectively taught in my classroom, despite its inclusion in the H-SS Framework, meant that my peers did not encounter my story, my family's story or the Sikh community's 125-year story.
Specifically including teaching about the Sikh community in a positive way in the curriculum, is the only way teachers will actually bring it into the classroom.
One of MY state-approved textbooks in seventh grade gave completely FALSE information about the origins of Sikhs and who they are today. Not only was the district not teaching about my community, but was giving false information when doing so.
The impact my community has made to the California economy, transportation systems, agriculture and the harassment my brothers and father face every-time they step out of the door, needs to be known not hidden or tossed aside.
The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative that only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
