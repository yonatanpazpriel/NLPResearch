From: Ealon Joelson Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 6:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Reject the ESMC
To whom it may concern:
I am a taxpayer in California, with an unbroken line of public education from the time I entered kindergarten until the time I graduated medical school. I had always considered my exemplary education to be a reflection of the quality of instruction promoted by the public school system of this State. For that reason, I am chagrined to learn of the content in the proposed, revised ethnic studies curriculum (ESMC).
I recognize the improvements made over the first draft, where overtly anti-Semitic themes have been removed from the body of the curriculum. However, source material in the footnotes and references continue to advocate the BDS movement, which seeks to demonize Jews living in their ancestral homeland (Israel), thereby castigating Jews in pursuit of their right to selfdetermination. The ESMC sees only one group-the Jews- as not having that human right. Just for perspective, the German Government has determined that BDS is anti-Semitic in nature (and I assume they know it when they see it), and likewise many State legislatures- including California- have passed bills prohibiting state business activity with firms participating in BDS.
To rectify this flaw I suggest the curriculum more clearly define anti-Semitism; specifically including the notion that double standards imposed on the Jewish nation are a form of ethnic hatred. And for that reason reliance on references that support BDS must be removed from the ESMC.
I urge you not to fall prey to short-sighted individuals who have allowed the ESMC to have been co-opted by those who have a political agenda that targets Jews. I do not think this is the lesson that Californians expect their future leaders to be taught within our public school system.
