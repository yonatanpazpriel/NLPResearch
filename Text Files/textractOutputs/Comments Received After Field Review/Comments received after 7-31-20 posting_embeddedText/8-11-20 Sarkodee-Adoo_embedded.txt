From: Nana Sarkodee-Adoo Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:50 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Adding Pacific Islander Studies to the CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good morning,
I am writing to express my support for the inclusion of Pacific Islander studies in the new curriculum for CA students. Children deserve to see themselves in their curriculum. Please consider adding this topic not only so this happens, but so students are taught accurate and larger history.
Thank you!
Best, Nana Sarkodee-Adoo MSW, MPH student, UCLA -Nana Sarkodee-Adoo Masters of Public Health Student, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health Masters of Social Welfare Student, UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs
