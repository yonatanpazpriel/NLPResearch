Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am glad that some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), however, I remain upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this current, flawed, draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
One of my major concerns can be seen in Appendix B and is the lesson included on the Movement for Black lives (M4BL), which is a separate organization from Black Lives Matter. M4BL is an aggressive pro-BDS group which calls Israel "an appartheid state" on their website, as well as blaming Israel for"the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people." This is a clearly one sided source of information which should not be included in the curriculum, as there as some links to the M4BL website in the curriculum.
I am a Californian Highschool student and I was born in Israel. Both of my parents lived in the soviet union but escaped to Israel near its collapse. It wouldn't be fair to teach a biased curriculum that only shows one view point and that has the potential to corrupt future minds into ideologies which are derived from misinformation and in extreme but rare cases, anti-semitism. Rather, the ESMC should strive to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected."
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Signature
