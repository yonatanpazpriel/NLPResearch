It is fine to mention in curriculums the ways Jews are oppressed wherever it is, but to use the Holocaust to justify the current illegal and racist oppression of the Palestinian people by the Israeli government is both ignorant and dishonest,. Would it be right to criticize and call those who opposed apartheid in south africa as anti white?, or call those who might oppose a murderous Latin American dictators policies as being anti hispanic? of course not! i hope this committee of educators will not fall into the false logic that criticizing Israeli policy is antisemetic, being a jew does not equate to being Israeli or being Zionist. so Palestinian history should be included in ethnic studies.
