From: JOSEPHINE FAITH ONG Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 5:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comment
My name is Josephine Ong, a Ph.D. student in Gender Studies at UCLA. I am originally from Guam, and am trained in its histories and ongoing social issues at UCLA. As an Ethnic and Gender Studies scholar that grew up in the Pacific Islands, I am writing out of concern around the lack of content about Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans in the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am a California resident with a M.A. in Asian American Studies from UCLA, one of the centers of Ethnic Studies in California, I have conducted research and have taught UCLA undergraduates about the 1968 Ethnic Studies movement that has culminated in the successful proposal for a statewide Ethnic Studies curriculum. As Pacific Islander scholars like Vicente M. Diaz and J. Kehaulani Kauanui argue in their 2001 article "Native Pacific Cultural Studies on the Edge," subsuming Pacific Islander Studies within the larger umbrella of Asian American Studies has invisiblized their historical and ongoing struggles.
At UCLA, my advisor, Associate Professor Keith L. Camacho of the Asian American Studies Department, and Political Science Associate Professor Randall Akee have led to the budding formation of Pacific Islands Studies at UCLA. With California containing one of the largest Pacific Islander populations in the United States, it is becoming more and more important to learn about their struggles at the college and secondary school level. Therefore, I write in support of including Pacific Islanders in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for the state of California.
Best, -Josephine Ong, M.A. (she/her/hers) Ph.D. Student, Gender Studies University of California, Los Angeles
