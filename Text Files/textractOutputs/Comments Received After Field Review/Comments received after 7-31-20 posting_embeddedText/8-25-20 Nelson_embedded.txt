From: Kristine Nelson Sent: Tuesday, August 25, 2020 9:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies in California Public Schools
I wanted to register my disagreement with this approach to achieving a greater understanding of race and racism and addressing issues of racial injustice and institutionalized racism. I do not want to see an ethnic studies approach to topics like math and science in particular - I do not think that centering an approach of racial identity in these subjects will be healthy for a unified, collaborative and inclusive approach to tackling issues of race in our state.
