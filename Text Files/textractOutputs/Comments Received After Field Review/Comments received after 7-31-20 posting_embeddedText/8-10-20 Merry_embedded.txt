Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
Although I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), I am very concerned by the flawed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
� Biased teachers can and will teach offensive anti-Israel content as historical truths. This has occurred in my three children's courses. They are afraid to raise their hands and announce to the class that the teacher is biased. In addition, their grades can and will suffer for being pro-Israel. � Pro-BDS is taught as a way to fight Israel. Nothing is taught about Jew's historical rights to be in Israel. In reality, the Jewish people have been in Israel for over 3,000 years. � Jews are stereotyped in this curriculum.
You have the power to end hatred, stereotypes, and brainwashing of young students.
I urge you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Linda Merry
