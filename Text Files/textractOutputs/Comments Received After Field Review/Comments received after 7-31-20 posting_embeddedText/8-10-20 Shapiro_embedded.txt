From: Matthew Shapiro Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:17 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Revised CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I understand that some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)has been attempted, but I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns
Asking Students to write a paper in the course detailing certain events in American history that have led to Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege is an inherently flawed perspective in the course curriculum.
Assuming that Jews have achived some sort of privledged place among minirities is on its face an inherently anti-Semitic perspective. It generalizes typical amnti-Semetic tropes and places Jews as above other minorities. This is divisive and a flawed set of facts in and of itself.
I am a Californian parent to two High School aged students and will not want my children to be placed into a class with this type of flawed curriculum. This type of teaching is something that I was subjected to in my university studies and forced a wedge between my Jewish community and other ethic minorities that my family supports.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Signature
