Hello,
I support the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) and consider the Arab American Studies component, within the rubric of Asian American Studies, to be critical and integral. Pacific Islander Studies must also be reinstated. I urge you to include both of these at the August 13th IQC convening.
In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
Furthermore, ethnic studies instruction has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for all students.
Additionally, I insist that an accurate telling of Palestine's history, as well as the current situation there, be included. It is not antisemitic to defend human rights - and the Zionist government (not Judaism, nor Jewish people on the whole) has been committing gross human rights violations on the Palestinian people for decades now. This fact is well documented, and to teach this history is simply to tell the truth.
All students need Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity and solidarity with each other, strengthening our movements for justice.
Lastly, I demand that the original curriculum writers are reconvened to give feedback prior to the November revisions.
Thank you, Benjamin Bonnet
