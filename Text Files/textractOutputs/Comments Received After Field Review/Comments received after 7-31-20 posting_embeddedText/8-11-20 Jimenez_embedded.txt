From: Jordan Jimenez Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 8:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and Pacific Islander/Arab American History
To whom it may concern,
I urge you to include pertinent information about Pacific Islander and Arab American history in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
As an educator, I see the value of representation and the power and potential it presents to kids. Please, in your design of culturally responsive curricula, be culturally responsive.
I have good faith in the intentions of this team, and I hope to see that our simple request is met.
Thank you for your time, Jordan Jimenez
