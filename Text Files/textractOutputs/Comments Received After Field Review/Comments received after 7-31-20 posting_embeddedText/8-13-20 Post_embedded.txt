Dear IQC members,
I want to thank you for the work you've done on the most recent revised draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I know it's hard and often thankless work, and I want you to know that as a Californian, I appreciate your efforts. I especially like how much easier this draft is to use, and the commitment to teaching students a diversity of perspectives.
However, I have concerns when it comes to references of Jewish Americans and antisemitism. It is highly centered on East European Jews, and this presents a misleading picture of American Jewish history, especially in California. My family is Persian, Jewish, and American, and as the Jewish and Middle East references are written now, they are totally erased.
I would encourage the committee to ensure that the ESMC should make clear that under the "broadly defined umbrella of Asian Studies" are Mizrahi Jews and other Middle Eastern and North African groups which represent 60% of California's MENA population. California Department of Education's Chapter 3 agrees: appropriate topics in the Asian section of Ethnic Studies courses are "the unique experiences of Arabs and other Middle Easterners."
Yad Vashem, The World Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa and the ADL are all excellent resources to address these shortcomings in any revisions. I look forward to seeing them!
Thank you.
All the best, Lauren Post
