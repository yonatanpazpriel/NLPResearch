From: Julie Mabel Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 12:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Objections to ESMC
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) that have recently been proposed, but I am deeply concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this most recent draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
My major concerns include the misrepresentation of Jews and other ethnic groups, as well as the imposing of a one-sided ideology. Numerous sections of the ESMC need revision to expose students to multiple and often competing sources of information and ensure that diverse viewpoints are respected. Furthermore, there should be a lesson plan covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience. There should be a removal of links to, and group advocacy of, virulently anti-Israel and pro-BDS sites with malicious slander about imaginary genocide.
I am a retired California educator, teacher, parent, and grandparent. I am a Jew. I want my own family and community, as well as those of future generations, to know and understand the detailed history and truths about my fellow Jews and the perspectives of people on all sides of stories and events.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised curriculum.
Respectfully, Juliet Mabel Foster City, California
