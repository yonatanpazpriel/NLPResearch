As a Jewish parent in Los Altos, I appreciate the changes made in the revision to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, but I am still appalled at its treatment of Jews and antisemitism. The Holocaust was only 75 years ago, but California educators seem to have forgotten about it. My murdered relatives deserve better.
I am also disappointed (but unfortunately not surprised) at the Curriculum's radical, unbalanced, left-wing perspective. This is not what our children deserve from Public education.
This can't be what the Legislature intended.
