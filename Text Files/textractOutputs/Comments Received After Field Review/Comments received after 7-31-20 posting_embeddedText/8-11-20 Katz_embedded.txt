Esteemed Committee members,
As a former teacher, now retired, I am reminded the the sacred responsibility that educators at every level hold. As we strive, during these tumultuous times, to create a world in which all humans are valued and all lives matter, I send a simple message regarding the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I urge each and all of you to craft a curriculum which presents ONLY factual historical background and that all resources to which young minds are directed be in that context. Optimally, too, teachers must separate any personal biases when presenting ANY information. These principles should guide your choices of both material and and individual/collective voices from which you derive guidance. I am extremely concerned that any extremist and racist propaganda, for example , related to the Arab- Israeli conflict serves to promote bias and hatred. I am concerned that finger pointing and isolating any of the parties involved serves to promulgate misunderstanding and to fan flames of discrimination. In your hands lies the responsibility of helping our youth understand and contribute to a world order based the most positive qualities of humanity which exist in each of us. I have confidence in your ability to provide the foundations to achieve this goal.
With thanks for your efforts,
Respectfully, Janice Katz
