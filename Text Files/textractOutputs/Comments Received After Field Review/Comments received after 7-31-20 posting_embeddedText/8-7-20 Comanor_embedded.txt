From: William Comanor Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 10:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members,
I am submitting this message as my comment on the ESMC. To start, I appreciate the important changes already made to the ESMC. While the new draft moves in the right direction, there are still issues that should be addressed.
I offer these suggestions as a UCLA professor who has taught university students for a great many years. There are important improvements in the curriculum to be made, and I hope you will consider the suggestions below.
All ethnicities have their own narratives, which often conflict with others. I would strongly emphasize that diverse viewpoints should be respected in all class discussions; and that the goal of inclusion refers also to opposing beliefs and opinions. Offering respect for divergent positions is an important trait to be valued and applauded.
Good luck with your project.
