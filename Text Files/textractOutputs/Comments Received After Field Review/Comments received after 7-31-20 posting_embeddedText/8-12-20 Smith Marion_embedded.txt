Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am reaching out about the proposed changes to California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation applauds the improvement that was made in Draft 2, such as the removal of explicitly antisemitic slurs and the addition of guidance for teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information"; however, there are still revisions that should be made to the current version.
Tens of millions of Americans trace their heritage to current or former communist countries, including 9 million Polish-Americans, 1.5 million Hungarian-Americans, and 660,000 Lithuanian-Americans. This past decade has demonstrated that communism still poses a threat to the human rights of one-fifth of the world's population who live under communist regimes today. The Foundation's most recent annual poll on U.S. Attitudes Toward Socialism, Communism, and Collectivism showed increased support for communism (36%) among Millennials compared to 2018. Seventy percent of Millennials say they are likely to vote socialist and only 57 percent of Millennials believe the Declaration of Independence better "guarantees freedom and equality" over the Communist Manifesto.
It is vital that our educational systems teach the truth about communism to all students. In the current ESMC Draft, the description of Pol Pot's genocidal reign is benign. There are many Cambodian-American students whose families fled the Khmer Rouge's bloody killing fields and they, along with all students, should learn the truth about this stain in history.
Based on the problematic "Guiding Values and Principles," the ESMC promotes and romanticizes specific political ideologies with no counterbalancing perspective. Guidelines should be added, and the sample lessons revised, to ensure that ethnic studies courses focus on a thorough understanding about ethnic groups, social issues, and civic engagement, without political proselytizing.
The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation has a curriculum, Communism: Its Ideology, Its History, and Its Legacy, intended for public, private, and home schools across the country. The curriculum

consists of 10 chapters and can be taught as one continuous series of lessons or chapters can be used as standalone supplements to an already-existing curriculum. Each chapter includes a historical lesson, notes which school standards are being met, and provides supplementary materials and activities for students. I am attaching a PDF version of our curriculum and encourage you to use this resource to modify the current ESMC Draft. I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Sincerely, Marion Smith Executive Director
