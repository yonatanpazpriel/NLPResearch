From: Mantej Singh Sent: Sunday, August 16, 2020 1:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
My name is Mantej Singh and I am a Sikh. I attend school in Fremont USD and have been a part of it for 10 years. From personal experience, I can say that the youth still do not feel represented or seen in the classroom, and we remain targets of bullying at a rate over twice the national average. For the past two years, I have been organizing events and activities to increase recognition of our Sikh faith, due to the fact that we do not have inclusion in our curriculum. Please do not continue to ignore our voice. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, supports more meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum. The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
