From: Jay A. Rosenheim Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 4:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education:
As an educator in California and the parent of two children in California's public schools, I want to express my strong concern regarding the 2nd draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I was, frankly, horrified to read the first draft, and felt that a completely new start was needed. This second draft is not that. It retains most of the key problems with the first draft ï¿½ primarily that it represents a particular political viewpoint and does not present balanced perspectives on controversial issues.
Please send this effort back to the start line. Building a deeper understanding of diversity issues in our state is important, but it needs to be done in an inclusive, truthful, and just way.
Sincerely,
Jay Rosenheim
