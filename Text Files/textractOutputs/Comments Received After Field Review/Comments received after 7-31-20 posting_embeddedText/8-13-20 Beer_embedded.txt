From: michael beer Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 9:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Ethnic Studies as Conceived
Dear Committee,
As a Jew whose ancestral home town was razed to the ground by the Nazis, I beseech you, I insist that you allow Arab Studies to continue as part of the ethnic studies curriculum. I want my children and grandchildren to grow up knowing the history of their Arab brothers and sisters. I want peace in the Middle East. I need you to foster that peace by allowing my people and Arab peoples to know and respect each other's traditions. Please do not give in to pressure from right-wing Zionist organizations who do not speak for the 67% of Jews who live outside the State of Israel.
Sincerely yours, Michael Beer [address redacted]
