Shereen Bhalla, Director of Education at the Hindu American Foundation
Agenda #2.A.3 As a Californian Hindu, I look forward to an inclusive ethnic studies curriculum. One that represents the many contributions made by different immigration groups and one that is fair and equitable in its portrayal of these groups. I ask the committee to please use my expertise as an educator and one that has a career in Hinduism to be a resource for the next draft. My email address is shereen@
