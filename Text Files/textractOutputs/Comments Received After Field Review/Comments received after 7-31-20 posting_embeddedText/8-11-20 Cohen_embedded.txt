From: Lisa & Bob Cohen Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 7:56 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] curriculum concerns
In the 38 years we have been in California we have witnesses a steady deterioration of the public school curriculum.
Instead of focusing on reading,science,writing, literature, and math, the adopted revisionist curriculums have turned students into helpless, whining, entitled victims.
Entitlement does not make the world a better place. Demonizing successful institutions and traditions such as the Constitution, capitalism, does not improve society. Revisionist history such as this curriculum and that of the communist Howard Zinn does not bring people of different backgrounds closer together.
This divisive indoctrination has to stop if you really want our children to succeed in the world in order to improve their lives and society.
We have grown children and now we have grandchildren. If this is the poison you plan to teach in the California public schools, we will ensure they attend charter or private schools or encourage them to leave California.
Best regards, Lisa and Robert Cohen
