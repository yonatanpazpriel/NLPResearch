The Black Lives Matter movement is proof positive that we need more aggressive ethnic studies education in our schools (as well as appreciation for toxic multi-generation stress on the Black community). The rise of AAPI hate incidents during this COVID-19 quarantine is proof positive that our youngsters, soon to become young adults, need to understand the history, culture, contributions of people of color. The president's continuing attacks on immigrants, Muslims, people from Mexico, middle East and China is proof positive that our students need to learn and appreciate other cultures and not be manipulated by inflammatory rhetoric and falsehoods coming from him. It is within your roles to see that the focus on expanding ethnic studies is done on a statewide basis. Thank you for your consideration.
