To whom it may concern,
I was pleased to note the removal of antisemitic slurs and the addition of guidance for teachers on dealing with competing sources of information. However, I remain very troubled by the latest ESMC draft.
The second draft still includes material and references that to advocate the BDS movement which seeks to demonize Jews living in their ancestral homeland. This is a highly politically charged and extremely misunderstood topic, in addition to being used as an antisemitic tool in this country.
In addition a few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. These references need clarification and a definition for antisemitism that addresses stereotyping and double standards against Jews. So many of these stereotypes remain in active usage.
It is so important that we get our curriculum to reflect our cultural and racial diversity. Education should work toward building links, not creating division.

I therefore ask you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns. Please work toward making the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to build bridges of intergroup understanding and to ensure critical thinking.
Thank you,
