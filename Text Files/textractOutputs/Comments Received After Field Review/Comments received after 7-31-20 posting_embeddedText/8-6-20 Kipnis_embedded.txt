Dear IQC Members,
Please find below my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work during this time. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.
Best,

I applaud the California Department of Education (CDE) for making important and positive changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), and thank you for your hard work during this difficult time. In particular, I appreciate the removal of explicitly anti-Israel and antisemitic content from the ESMC, and the inclusion of some important references to the Jewish American experience. These changes demonstrate a conscious effort to fix numerous problems in the first draft.
While this new draft is clearly a step in the right direction, there are still significant areas of concern in the ESMC which must be addressed. For example, the "Guiding Values and Principles" of the ESMC directly reference and are partly based on specific pages from a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives. The guiding values and principles should be revised to ensure that they cannot be used to justify promoting those agendas in the classroom.
I thank you once again for your hard work and hope you will accept my constructive feedback regarding this crucially important curriculum for our state.
