From: STEPHEN LEVIN Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:52 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pacific Islander and Arab American Content in the ESMC
To Whom It May Concern,
This email is in regard to the wrongful and, frankly shameful, removal of the Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies content from the California ESMC. Visibility and inclusion is essential in K-12 education; in fact, it is essential in all education. All of our California students--from PK through college--deserve to see themselves in school curricula and for far too long have been erased from texts and classroom discussions.
I find it especially disappointing that Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies content, having already been created by Ethnic Studies scholars, was present in an earlier draft and was removed by CDE staff. The content should be returned to current drafts and remain present in the form that is finally published for our use.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely, Steve Levin -Steve Levin (he/him) Teacher, RISE Academy, English Language Development (ELD) OUSD Oakland High School Every Student Thrives!
