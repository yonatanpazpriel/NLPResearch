From: Wan, Alva Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 4:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] In support of Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies
Hello,
My name is Alva Wan. I am a middle school teacher at Visitacion Valley Middle School. I teach English Language Development.
I was born and raised in Guam (Guahan) before moving here to California.
I am Chinese, and I am Guamanian. It's important for me to not only see Asian American studies, but also to see my home island and fellow islanders represented in the curriculum. I have always identified more with being Guamanian than with being Chinese. The lack of PI representation in my educational experiences has made me feel like I was inferior and that my home was not important and worthy to be mentioned. I can empathize with the devastating effects our PI students and Arab American Students feel without representation in their schools' curriculum. And when you take away those opportunities where they could learn about themselves, see themselves and their heritage, and develop strong and proud identities, that's unacceptable.
I am advocating for: -Reconvening the original committee of writers and experts with the inclusion of additional Pacific Islander representation. -Passing a model curriculum (w/Ethnic Studies Principles) that includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American content inclusive of Palestine.
Not including representation is perpetuating systemic racism. We are in this fight together, so I urge you to help us fight against inequitable representation in our education system.

Best, Alva Wan
