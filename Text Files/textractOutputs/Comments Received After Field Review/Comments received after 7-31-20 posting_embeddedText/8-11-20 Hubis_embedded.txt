From: Kyra Hubis Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 11:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Second draft ESMC
To the Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Eduication:
I am a CA resident, taxpayer, former educator and the parent of a high school educator.
I understand that there was some improvement in the ESMC but i am still amaze by the continued imposition of an offensive, historically inaccurate and one-sided political idealogy that still remains. Few mentions of the use in the curriculum of reliable statistics and influences upon ethnic disparaties is evident...it all seems to be resting on the "victim status" of minority groups and the "racism" of those with whom they come into contact. There does not seem to be an emphasis on teaching our young people all sides of the issues minorities...and yes all of us...sometimes face. I have served on faculty search committees wherein the major criterion for hiring seemed to be the race of the propective faculty rather than merit and experience. Is this the process with which we want to inculcate our children? There are many facets to the ethnic divides and let us teach them all fairly and in an unbiased manner. Please make significant further revisions to the ESMC and align the ESMC more closely with the orignial ESMC guidelines. The future mind set of our children must not be politicized and manipulated by our schools by adopting the ESMC so hastily
