From: Lucy Janjigian Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 5:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] PUT ARAB ETHNIC STUDIES BACK IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CURRICULUM - IT SHOULD NOT BE REMOVED . WHO DID IT?
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT ARABIC STUDIES AND ETHNIC STUDIES OF MINORITIES BE INCLUDED IN THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL CURRICULUM.. WHO REMOVED THEM AND WHY?
STUDENTS SHOULD STUDY AND KNOW ABOUT THE OTHER AND NOT ONLY ABOUT THEMSELVES.. AND WHO ARE THESE ? THIS WOULD BE CONSIDERED RACIAL PROFILING. IT IS RACIST - THAT IS WHAT THE NATION IS FACING AND PEOPE ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE. ARE WE GOING BACKWARDS?
WE ARE A DEMOCRACY - ALL ARE EQUAL ETHNIC STUDIES SHOULD AND MUST INCLUDE STUDIES OF ALL ETHNIC GROUPS.
THANK YOU FOR CARING AND RESPONDING.
