From: Eira Kien Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 10:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Keep Arab American Studies and Pacific Islander Studies in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello,
My name is Eira Kien and I am a City College of San Francisco student that largely benefitted from our very our Ethnic Studies curriculum.
I am emailing because there are major gaps in the current Ehtnic Studies Model Curriculum as there is currently no representation of Pacific Islander and Arab American communities.
I am urging the CDE to: - Reconvene the original ESMC committee of writers and experts with the inclusion of additional Pacific Islander representation - Pass a model curriculum that includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies inclusive of Palestine.
As an Asian American, it was essential to learn about my own history, and strengthen my identity, and it even led to getting employed as a tutor. Pacific Islanders and Arab Americans should have their same opportunity and representation. They should not be ignored or erased in this K-12 curriculum.
Sincerely, Eira Kien
