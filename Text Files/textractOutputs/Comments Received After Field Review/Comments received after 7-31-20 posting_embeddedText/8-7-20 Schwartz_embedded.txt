From: Ruth Schwartz Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 9:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear IQC Members, I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work during this time. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.
I am a CA resident and a former teacher whose grandson recently graduated from UC Berkeley and is working toward a teaching credential. I am encouraged by the changes made to the ESMC with a greater inclusion and sensitivity to Jews in our country.
I was surprised and disturbed to see that teachers are advised to create linkage with anti-Zionism, BDS and anti-Israel narratives. I hope that I misinterpreted that information. Anti-Semitism is often disguised as anti-Zionism.
I do not know how much information is given to the existence of anti-Semitism in the revised curriculum. In 2019 there were 2,107 acts committed, a 12% increase over 2018. A significant number of anti-Semitic acts occurred at K-12 and college campuses. You have the power in your curriculum to change minds for good or evil. What an awesome responsibility. The statistics are from the ADL, a respected, mainstream civil rights organization.
Thank you so much for the changes you have made and continuing to consider the suggestions from the community.
Sincerely, Ruth Schwartz
