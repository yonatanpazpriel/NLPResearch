From: Margot Lurie Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 7:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum chapter: "Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies."
Dear California curriculum managers,
As a native Californian, educated in our public school system, I write to express lingering concerns over the new curriculum. While the revision is a positive step, there are remaining flaws that denigrate and devalue the Jewish community, representing a skewed and ahistorical perspective.
Take chapter 1, "Guiding Values and Principles of Ethnic Studies." These Guiding Values and Principles directly reference and are partly based on a book called Education at War. The relevant section of the book effectively encourages teachers to "develop solidarity and create linkages" with anti-Zionism, BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, which would be deeply harmful to many Jewish students in the classroom. This is a skewed historical narrative that does not represent the truth.
I urge you to revisit this chapter and confront the biases inherent in it.
Yours in gratitude,
