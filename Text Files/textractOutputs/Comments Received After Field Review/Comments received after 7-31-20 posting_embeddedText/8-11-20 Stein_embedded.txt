I am a retired physician. My public education in the San Francisco School district was excellent. I believe that, in part, it was a reflection of the quality of instruction promoted by the public school system of California. For that reason, I am somewhat shocked to learn of the proposed, revised ethnic studies curriculum (ESMC).
I recognize that some good changes were made from the first draft. However, serious concerns remain. Source material in the footnotes and reference continue to support the BDS movement. This results in demonizing Jews living in their ancestral homeland (Israel), thereby castigating Jews who pursue their right to self-determination. The ESMC sees only one group, the Jews, as not having that human right. For example, Germany has determined that BDS is anti-Semitic in nature. Many state legislatures- including California- have passed bills prohibiting state business activity with firms participating in BDS.
I suggest the curriculum more clearly define anti-Semitism; including the notion that double standards imposed on the Jewish nation are a form of ethnic hatred.
It's imperative to remove from the ESMC all references to BDS which not only targets Israel, but Jews. I do not think this is the lesson that Californians expect their future leaders to be taught within our public school system.
Sincerely,
Morton J. Stein, M.D.
