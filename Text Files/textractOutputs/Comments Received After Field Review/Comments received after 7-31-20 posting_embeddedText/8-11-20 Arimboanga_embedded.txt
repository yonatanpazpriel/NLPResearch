From: Jr Arimboanga Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 6:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support To Include Pacific Islander Studies in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriulum
As an Ethnic Studies high school teacher for over a decade in Oakland, San Francisco, and now Stockton, it is imperative we include the voices and experiences of Pacific Islanders in the Ethnic Studies model curriculum. The PI struggles, triumphs, and current experiences are in direct alignment with the history, purpose, and vision of the curriculum. With so many of our students coming from PI communities, we must ensure that they are reflected in the curriculum.
