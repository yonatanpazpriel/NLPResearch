Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
� The curriculum advocate a narrow political philosophy. � In my opinion the curriculum does not reflect California's shared values, nor the values
laid out in AB 2016 � I would like to see a definition of antisemitism to address various contemporary
manifestations of antisemitism, including stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum. � In my opinion, the curriculum should have specific lesson materials on antisemitism as a form of racism and bigotry.
I am a Californian parent of 3 children of a Jewish descent and a Santa Clara County foster Family. My Family survived the holocust and I'm outraged that political views are making their ways to school curriculum.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Kobi Meir, San Jose CA
