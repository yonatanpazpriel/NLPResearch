My name is Bob Gordon.
In 1993, I moved to California from a state with very few Jews, very few people of color and very little understanding of one another.
As a gay Jewish man, I sought out an environment of diversity, with respect for that diversity.
I would like to thank the California Department of Education for working so hard to improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I would like to see the next draft of the curriculum include the lesson plan, "Antisemitism and Middle EasternAmerican Jews" produced by the organization, JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa, as it will provide students with high-quality instruction on contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern-American Jewish experience.
2018 California Hate Crime Statistics noted that Anti-Jewish events increased by over twenty percent while AntiMuslim bias events decreased by more than forty percent. As a Jewish person who has experienced anti-Jewish hatred, I believe our students deserve to learn about both Islamophobia and Antisemitism in an ethnic studies framework.
Thank you for your kind consideration.
Bob Gordon, San Francisco
