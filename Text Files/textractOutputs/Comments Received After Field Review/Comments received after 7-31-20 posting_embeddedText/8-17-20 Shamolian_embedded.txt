From: Jasmine Shamolian Sent: Monday, August 17, 2020 2:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Subject: [EXTERNAL] Letter from Councilmember Koretz to Gov. Newsom: Veto AB 1460!
August 17, 2020
Governor Gavin Newsom 1303 10th Street, Suite 1173 Sacramento, CA 95814
Dear Governor Newsom:
I echo the call of 90 groups urging you to veto AB 1460. I also ask you to call on CSU Chancellor Timothy White and the CSU Board of Trustees to institute robust safeguards against using CSU classrooms to promote one-sided political advocacy, bias, and hate. I am deeply concerned that without adequate safeguards, the discussions in these classrooms could morph into one-sided political advocacy and activism that will both subvert the academic mission of the university, and incite bigotry and harm against students.
Israel and Jewish students have been the target of biased and unwarranted harassment for the past decade in colleges and high schools. Vetoing AB 1460 is necessary because anti-Zionist advocacy and the promotion of BDS are an intrinsic part of critical ethnic studies and it has repeatedly been demonstrated by critical ethnic-studies faculty, a willingness to promote BDS and anti-Zionist advocacy in their academic programming and classrooms.
Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns and I urge you to veto AB 1460. It is in our best interest to strive for the equal treatment of all and we hope that your actions will send a similar message.
Sincerely,
PAUL KORETZ Councilmember, 5th District
