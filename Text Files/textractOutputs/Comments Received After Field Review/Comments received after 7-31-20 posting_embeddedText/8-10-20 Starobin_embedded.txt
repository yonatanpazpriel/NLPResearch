From: Julie Starobin Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Americans cannot be excluded from Ethnic Studies.
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
I think the original committee should be reconvened and their original suggestions be implemented. Do not eliminate Arab-American people or Palestinians or Pacific Islanders from Ethnic Studies.
The different communities represented in an Ethnic Studies curriculum should be the ones who make the decisions about that curriculum and should be listened to.
Ethnic studies should maintain the principles and values that were in the model originally developed by 18 community members.
Thanking you in advance for these changes.
Sincerely, Julie Starobin
