From: Emilly Rodriguez Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 4:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Including PI and Arab studies in Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello,
My name is Emilly Rodriguez and I am a middle school social studies teacher in SFUSD.Thank you CDE and Superintendent Thurmond for moving forward with conversations to include Pacific Islander and Arab American Studies.
I also want to highly encourage the commission to:
1. Use a transparent and inclusive process moving forward, reconvening the original committee of writers and experts WITH the inclusion of additional Pacific Islander representation.
2.Pass a model curriculum that aligns with Ethnic Studies Principles to eradicate racism - and includes Pacific Islander studies and Arab American studies content inclusive of Palestine.
This is important because ending, rather than contributing to systemic racism benefits everyone. It is important now more than ever, to include all people's stories.
Thank you.
