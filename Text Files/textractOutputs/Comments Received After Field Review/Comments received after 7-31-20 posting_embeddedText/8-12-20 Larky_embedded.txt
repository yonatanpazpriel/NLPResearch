8/11/20 Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, As a third generation Californian and a parent I write to state that improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is essential. I remain extremely concerned by the use of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that misrepresents Jews and other ethnic groups. Given that anti-semitism is rampant on college campuses we need to stem this tide through accurate teaching and education in the elementary, middle and high school years. All you need to do is read this story, one of many such stories, to recognize that change is needed, but that the proposed curriculum does not address important issues such as that discussed in the article with the below link,https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/columnist/editors-note/319995/the-failureof-usc-leaders-to-condemn-jew-hatred-allows-a-virus-to-spread/.
Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles, since all lessons stem from these Principles. Just as I don't recall learning about Manzanar in my high school education, we must ensure that historical topics continue to be taught in a thoughtful manner and discussed without cultural or religious bias. It is very important that multiple and often competing sources of information are provided for discussion in class and for students to consider, contemplate and discuss in a safe and inclusive forum without curriculum or teacher bias.
Thank you,
Jan Larky Cupertino, CA
