From: Meira Gotesdyner Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 4:23 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] concerns about the curriculum
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns
_
�
� The BLM lesson in the African American section lists the following as THE resource:
� https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/summer-2017/bringing-black-lives-matter-into-theclassroom-part-ii
�
In it, Palestine equated with South Africa and Stonewall. This is the same article that describes non-violent civil rights leaders as "passive" and "docile" and considers Black Panthers to be "heroes."
�
� Appendix A lists a course with the following lesson plan: "Students � will write a paper detailing certain events in American history that have led to
Jewish and Irish Americans gaining racial privilege. � They will be asked to think critically about why and who is allowing this
evolutionin white identity." � Among the many issues with this assignment is that it, in itself, can be
considered anti-Semitic.
�
�
� One of the approved courses in Appendix A uses Amal Amireh's essay `Palestinian Women's Disappearing Act: The
� Suicide Bomber Through Western Feminist Eyes.'

I am a Californian teacher and parent and my daughter suffered from a misguided and ignorant teacher when she was in 11th grade. He went to a teacher workshop that was sponsored by some Israel and Jews haters under the umbrella of "social justice". He incorporated this hate and lies in his curriculum without even searching it before. After he was challenged with facts , he apologized and had to retrieve, but it caused a spark of hate against Jews.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Meira Gotesdyner
