From: Filipinx Health Initiative Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:58 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC - Comment by FHI
Dear IQC Commissioners,
On behalf of Filipinx Health Initiative (FHI) - SF, we are submitting comments in response to the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. We write to express grave concerns regarding the lack of Pacific Islander (PI) AND Arab American Studies representation in the latest draft of the ESMC.
As an organization and as individuals, we are committed to the work in solidarity with PI and Arab communities. Our people, our histories and our current movements are intertwined, though our specific experiences differ. We maintain the community that we cultivate together and we maintain advocating for each other.
The lack of representation of PI and Arab communities would be detrimental to youth, whether they identify as such or not. It would further lead to invisibility, insensitivity, and the feeling of not being welcome. These harms already contribute to systemic disparities of health regarding PI and Arab communities.
I urge the CDE Curriculum Team and Instructional Quality Commission to pass an ESMC that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines moving forward and work with the respective communities to ensure this happens. We also demand that the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) committee of writers and experts be reconvened. This committee of Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy.
Thank you for the opportunity to submit comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do not hesitate to contact FHI to provide further information
Sincerely,
Erin Rose Cruz Filipinx Health Initiative (FHI) - SF Program Coordinator
