From: Emily Blumenthal Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 4:15 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good afternoon,
I hope you're doing well. My name is Emily Blumenthal and I'm currently a masters student at UC Berkeley in their teacher education program working towards my secondary mathematics teaching credential. Ethnic Studies is a crucial class to teach students about the histories of those who have been historically marginalized and continue to resist oppression. This is so relevant and necessary to include in our schools because of the rampant violence against people of color by our police and the inequities exacerbated by COVID-19.
As a Jewish American woman, I stand in solidarity with the continued fight for justice and freedom in Palestine. I'm incredibly concerned by the removal of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the revision of Ethnic Studies curriculum. This act of erasure not only diminishes the power of Ethnic Studies curriculum, but is siding with the violent oppression of Arab American communities. I'm demanding that you allow Arab American scholars who are the experts of Arab American curriculum and pedagogy to be a part of the revisions to the ESMC.
I hope you listen to the cries of the communities and return to the roots of what Ethnic Studies pedagogy truly is.
Sincerely,
Emily Blumenthal
