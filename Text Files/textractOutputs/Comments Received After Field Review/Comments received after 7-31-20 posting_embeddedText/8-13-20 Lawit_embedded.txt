I am a retired teacher and a concerned community member living in Oakland. My concern is for all students to feel represented in our California schools. I believe there should be no erasure of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies - they both need to be included in the ESMC and Palestine needs to be included within Arab American studies. The original committee of writers and experts should be reconvened to revise the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It's necessary to have the scholars and teachers who have the expertise on ethnic studies curriculum and pedagogy to do this work. Thank you, let's do the best for all our students!
