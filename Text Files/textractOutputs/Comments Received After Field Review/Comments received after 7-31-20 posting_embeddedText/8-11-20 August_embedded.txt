From: Barbara August Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 5:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concern about the ESMC Draft 2
To whom it may concern:
I am concerned about references to Jews in the second draft of the ES curriculum, as they are misleading and offensive. I believe that antisemitism should be taught as racism and bigotry, which it clearly is.
I hope that you will consider these points in the final writing.
Thank you,
