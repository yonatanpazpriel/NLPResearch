As a former student of CA public schools and a current resident of CA, I can't stress enough how important it is to include Arab American Studies into the curriculum of Asian American Studies. The history of Palestine and the current struggles of Palestine are important topics that must be included in our Ethnic studies curriculum. It is not anti-Semitic to defend human lives of indigenous people. Moreover these revisions should be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies practitioners. The public is watching you. Do the right thing.
