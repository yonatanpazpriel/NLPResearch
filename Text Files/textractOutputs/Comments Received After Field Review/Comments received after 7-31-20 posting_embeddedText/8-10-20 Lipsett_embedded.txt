Hello,
I am writing to you as a Jewish educator in the Bay Area, urging you to include Arab American studies in California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It is crucial that all our students learn with and amongst their Arab classmates about Arab history and movements of struggle and liberation. Ethnic studies should focus on examining systems of power and privilege, and it not synonymous with multicultural studies. It would be a disservice to all students to exclude Arab American studies from this curriculum.
In the post-9/11 era, made worse by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are in desperate need of a curriculum that refelcts thier histories and current realities. According to Arab Youth Organizing's findings, over 65% of students surveyed said they learned about Arabs and/or Muslims from internet and TV, and only 2% from Arabs/Muslims themselves. This must change. We must teach our students about Arab American history and reality through the lived experiences and curriculum-writing of Arabs and/or Muslims themselves.
Thank you, Kara Lipsett Oakland, CA
