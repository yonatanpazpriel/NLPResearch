Hello, The driving points in the California Department of Education discussion revolves around how to create empathy among various groups. First, a criticism of Israel is not anti-semitism. All nations have their dark and bright histories. Second, watering down the curriculum especially the colonial, imperial, racial, and structural violence foundations of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict only poloarize learners to seek answers elsewhere. Third, the attacks on the Jewish learners and Sikh is only a manifestation of the watered down histories of the region. Learners find it difficult to separate between Muslims and Shikhs due to lack of in-depth and rigorous curriculum. In addition, the current history of the Palestine-Israeli conflict is riddled with vagueness and inaccuracies make it difficult for learners to identify with the Jewish experience. Fourth, it is not the goal of Ethnic Studies to give a happily ever after narrative because the struggle is systematic because of the colonial, imperial, and white privilege embedded structures in our daily lives.
