Dear Mr. Thurmond; I have been informed that you have authorized the story of the plight of the Palestinian people. While I applaud acknowledgement of all people, I am concerned that any inference that the Palestine people were victimized by the state of Israel, implies that Israel is an oppressive state. Given the thousand of years of institutional antisemitism and the current level of such in our nation, I would caution about adding fuel to fake, racist arguments.
Similarly, I would hope that any revision of textbooks accurately reflect our nation's history, including the genocide against native Americans, the atrocity of slavery, and American imperialism and aggression in the 19th and 20th century. Ideas like Manifest Destiny and Communism domino theory need to be explained for perspective. As you know, those that do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it. As a country, we need to own up to our past actions, not excuse it.
Thank you,
Rick Kohl
