From: Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 5:24 PM To: Superintendent Subject: [EXTERNAL] ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
Dear Superintendent Thurmond --
I supported your candidacy for this job exactly for matters such as this, knowing you could be counted on to take a principled position.
I'm a long-time resident of California, grateful that 27-yo child received an excellent education in California public schools, K-12.
Diversity of voices, particularly of under represented communities makes for high quality learning and strengthens the entire community.
Please reconvene the original committee of writers and experts to revise the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Ethnic Studies scholars and teachers are the experts on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy. Arab American scholars and teachers are the experts on Arab American curriculum and pedagogy.
Requesting you respond to this issue with clarity, courage and transparency.
Thank you,
Ellen Toomey
