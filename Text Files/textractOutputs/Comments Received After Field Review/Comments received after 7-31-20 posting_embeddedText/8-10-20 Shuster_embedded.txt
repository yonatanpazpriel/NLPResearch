Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I, Luda Shuster, am pleased with some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I'm particularly pleased with addition of guidance for teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints.
However, I am concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are some of my concerns:
� ESMC guiding values and principles are partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students
� The BLM lesson in the African American section lists the following as THE resource: https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/summer-2017/bringing-black-lives-matterinto-the-classroom-part-ii In it, Palestine equated with South Africa and Stonewall. This is the same article that describes non-violent civil rights leaders as "passive" and "docile" and considers Black Panthers to be "heroes."
� One of the approved courses in Appendix A uses Amal Amireh's essay `Palestinian Women's Disappearing Act: The Suicide Bomber Through Western Feminist Eyes.'

I am a Californian grandparent. It is important to me that in my granddaughter's classroom there is atmosphere of respect and inclusion of all ethnicities, free of bias and misinformation.
I ask you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address my concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
Luda Shuster
