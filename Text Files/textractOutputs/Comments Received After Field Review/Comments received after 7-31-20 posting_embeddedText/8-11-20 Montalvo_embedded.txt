From: Marcelo Felipe Garzo Montalvo Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 3:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies; IQC Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Greetings ICQ and Ethnic Studies committee,
I am writing to express my support for the original ESMC and my profound disapproval of the current revisions. I am writing as an alumni of UC Berkeley's Ethnic Studies programs, with a BA, MA and PhD in the field, and as the first Lecturer in Latinx Studies at Harvard University, a position I am beginning in the Fall. The stakes of this model curriculum are extremely high, and the specific pieces that were removed in this past revision have effectively taken the essence out of the curriculum as an Ethnic Studies project. I urge you to honor the original draft and coauthors, and find a way to work with current Ethnic Studies scholars and educators to ensure the integrity of this important curriculum. The revisions that were made under the pressure of conservative and outside forces should not be allowed to silence these important voices. If you move forward with these current revisions, you all will be directly participating in this historical silencing and marginalization of communities of color and our voices. Please find a way to create a genuine Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in this historic moment.
Your constituent, Marcelo Garzo Montalvo, BA, MA and PhD, UC Berkeley Ethnic Studies Visiting Assistant Professor, Latinx Studies (Ethnicity, Migration and Rights), Harvard University
