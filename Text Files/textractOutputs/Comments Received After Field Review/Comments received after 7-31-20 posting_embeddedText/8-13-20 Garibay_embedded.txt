From: Oscar Garibay Sent: Wednesday, August 12, 2020 10:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good evening,
My name is Oscar Garibay, I am an Ethnic Studies educator out of Stockton, Ca.
I am emailing you because I would like to urge you that it is critical that we pass an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that includes both Pacific Islander and Arab American course outlines (including Palestine in Arab American Studies). Leaving these two groups out of Ethnic Studies erases their experiences and contributions. I would like my Pacific Islander students and Arab American students to be seen within the curriculum.
I would also like to urge you to please reconvene the original committee of writers and experts to revise the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. It is important that our Ethnic Studies teachers and experts continue to be part of the process till the end.
Best,
Oscar Garibay
