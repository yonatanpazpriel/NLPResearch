Dear IQC Members, I am submitting the attached document as my comment on the ESMC. I applaud the CDE for making important changes to the ESMC, and appreciate their hard work during this time. While this new draft is a step in the right direction, I urge you to make further changes to address shortcomings that remain in the curriculum.
The Ancient Civilization of India, needs lots of correcting. Starting from calling BRAHMIN/ CASTEISM/ RACISM.
Bhartiya/ Indian- social structure was established based on VARNJATI. In Sanskrit it means VARNA (to choose), JATI( blood/ born in)
We never had a word CASTE, it's a Portugeese word. Just like PANEER we call it COTTAGE CHEESE in America just 'coz its easy to understand universally.
And BRAHMINS are scholarly people. And they are part of the Hindu social culture. Demeaning them and using them as a Racist is not right.
Also, school teachers need to connect with local parents and work with them when it comes to teaching these materials. There are certain tricky words, phrases which change their meaning if we translate them. Kindly, look into it.
Thank you for giving me a chance to express my views. Appreciate it.
