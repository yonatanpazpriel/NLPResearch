From: Rania Bilwani Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 11:32 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hello,
I am a UC student and I am concerned about the erasure of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the revisions to curriculum.
I would like to see an ESMC passed that includes Pacific Islander and Arab American studies course outlines and includes Palestine in Arab American studies.
Thank you, Rania Bilwani
