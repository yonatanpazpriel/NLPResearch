From: Moe Cevallos Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 8:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comments on Item 2 History-Social Science SMC
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
My name is: Mauricio Cevallos
My brief Background: Born in Quito, Ecuador arriving at age 8 into New York City public school system: US Army veteran ( Vietnam, linguist); BS, MS Degree in Finance, followed by a 45-year employment history. Currently a 25-year resident of California, now retired.
My Organization: LATINX for Quality Education
My Comments:
After reading the 2nd Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, I would encourage a better sense of balance and inclusion, in particular, the broad, diverse Latinx community. In addition, the overwhelming emphasis on oppression of certain groups overlooks the significant assimilation of various Latinx communities throughout California and the broader USA.
I would encourage more focus on the following goals for a more inclusive and balanced curriculum:
That students should not be encouraged or required to think of themselves as victims.
That the curriculum should include positive role models.
That the curriculum should be representative of all Latinx, not just those of select populations.
That students should learn about inspirational Latinx leaders who have succeeded in America.
That many Latinx fled Marxist governments and have thrived in the democratic, capitalist system here.
While I recognize the complexity of developing a curriculum that is more inclusive and balanced, I would strongly encourage additional efforts to eliminate any sense of divisiveness, victimhood, and any overt or subtle emphasis that oppression and anti-capitalist narratives are the only avenues for discussion when viewing Ethnic Studies in California.
Thank you for your consideration of my recommendations.
Mauricio F. Cevallos
