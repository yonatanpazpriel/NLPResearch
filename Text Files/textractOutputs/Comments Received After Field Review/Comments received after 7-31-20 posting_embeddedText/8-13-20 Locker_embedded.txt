Yes, include a lesson plan about Palestine. And make sure you include: � When Rome conquered the Jewish people and renamed the land Palestine � The Jewish people, who were identified as Palestinians prior to 1948 � Arab grand-mufti who sided with Hitler � How the Palestinians were created by Arafat an Egyptian born terrorist in 1964 The fact that a mosque was built on top of the holy temple by Islamic colonists � The 800,000 Jews who were forcibly expelled from Arab lands � That BDS is conceived as a way to isolate and destroy the only Jewish nation
When you include these facts, we will no longer consider the Arab and pro-Palestine opinions as Jew hatred. Because the way it's worded now, it most certainly is.
As outlined by a multitude of callers, many of us are horrified that you're using our tax dollars on this deeply flawed, polarizing, and divisive venture. No one is happy with this outline.
