I write as a member of the Board of the American Jewish Committee. I am deeply disturbed by the late night, last minute and secretive modifications to the ethnic studies curriculum recommendations of the Department of Education. Asking the IQC to approve adding two additional ethnic groups, Pacific Islanders and Arab- Americans, when those curriculum have not been reviewed and indeed with regard to Arab Americans not yet drafted, is inappropriate and outrageous. This is particularly true when the initial module regarding Arab Americans contained heavily anti-semitic content, received 30,000 comments from the Jewish Community objecting to that content and was then deleted altogether under the Department of Education curriculum recommendations, until late last night. We are now asked to take on faith and approve an as yet unseen module. I strongly support a comprehensive and inclusive ethnic studies program and believe that should include the Jewish community, the number one victims of hate crimes in California and the United States as well as other minority groups that make up the rich fabric of California society. The stated goals of the Ethnic Studies Program are to teach compassion and understanding to the children of California. The only version of the Arab American module that has ever seen the light of day, taught hatred, blame, and violence. Please do not approve this last minute stealth jockeying. Thank you.
