Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I remain very concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this proposed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns (take examples from the email:
The second draft does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC's first draft.
� Add Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the LA Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum to provide solid ground rules for course development
� Numerous sections of the ESMC need revision to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected."
The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive.
� Remove links to, and group advocacy of, anti-Israel pro-BDS sites � Include Mizrahi and other Jews of color � Add a definition of antisemitism to address various contemporary manifestations of
antisemitism, including stereotyping and double standards against Jews and � Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum. � Add specific lesson materials on antisemitism as a form of racism and bigotry
I am a native Californian with 3 kids who have attended or will attend public CA high schools. I am also a Licensed Clinical Psychologist who works with school-age children and teens in the SF Bay Area. This curricula is critical to the proper education of our youth and is critical to the future of our state. Misunderstandings, ignorance, racism, and prejudice are harming our youth this curriculum, if designed fairly to educate based on facts, can and will lead to a much stronger state. It's so important that this curriculum builds connections rather than inflaming and further fracturing different groups of students in our schools.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Jessica Rosenbaum
