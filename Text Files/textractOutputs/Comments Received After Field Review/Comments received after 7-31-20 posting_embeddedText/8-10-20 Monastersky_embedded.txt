From: Eva Elizabeth Monastersky Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 2:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Model Curriculum (ESMC)
To the members of the IQC, I am a grandparent of 4 California primary school age children, and the daughter of Holocaust survivors. I am also a product of California's public education system. With the rampant rise in anti-Semitism, it is critical that our school's curriculums provide an honest, fair and hopeful representation of ethnic groups. The current revised draft of the ESMC is a good start, but does not go far enough in accuracy about Israel and how antisemitism is manifested in malicious stereotyping. It also includes harmful links to anti-Israel and BDS sites. The earlier in life that children can be taught about diversity, and given the basis for meaningful dialogue, the greater possibility for a respectful future for all. Sincerely, Eva Monastersky
