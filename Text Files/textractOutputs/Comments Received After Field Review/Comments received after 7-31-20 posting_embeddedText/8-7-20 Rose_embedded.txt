From: Olivia Rose Sent: Thursday, August 6, 2020 5:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Superintendent; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] I support ESMC and Arab American Studies!
Hello,
My name is Olivia Rose and I am a San Jose resident and middle school/high school English and history teacher. It is readily apparent that ethnic studies are absolutely essential and have been desperately lacking in our public schools. I support including Arab American studies within the rubric for Asian American studies. West Asian experiences must be explicitly included in curriculum, especially in the era of xenophobia and, specifically, the Islamophobia that has overwhelmed our nation since 9/11. Additionally, the plight of Palestinians displaced from their land must be taught (personally, I teach this history in relation to the U.S.'s history of displacing and murdering millions of Native Americans for the sake of land and profit). Teaching the history of modern Palestine is not antisemitic; it is anti-colonialism and anti-white-supremacy.
Thank you for your time looking over this message!
