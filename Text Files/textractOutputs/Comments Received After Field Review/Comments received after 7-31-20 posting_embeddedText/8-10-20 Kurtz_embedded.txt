From: Michelle L Kurtz Sent: Sunday, August 9, 2020 7:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern.
I have a child in LAUSD, and I am so upset that this new CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum is going to be taught in our schools. It is antisemitc and disrespectful to the Jewish community.
While I understand there is a need to expose our children to multiculturalism, including anti Israel/anti-Zionism will promote hate and bullying our children.
We have been through enough without now having to defend our heritage in school now.
Please for the sake of our children and the community, rethink and take out the anti Israel and anti-Zionism and disrespect towards American Jews that will encourage hate and violence inside and outside of our schools.
Thank you. Michelle Kurtz
