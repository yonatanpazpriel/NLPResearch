From: Jean Quan Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 4:02 PM Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Draft2 Is Disappointing
I am in the queue but am not sure I be called on after 5 hours on hold.
You may remember me as the Mayor Of Oakland but I am also an original founder of the Ethnic Studies/ Asian American Studies at UC Berkeley and former Chair of the Asian Pacific Islander & Urban School Board Associations & National Council of Urban Boards of Education. I have been working for and waiting for a state-mandated Ethnic Studies curriculum for over 50 years. Last year I attended the Board of Education meeting and was disappointed at the delay and distortion of the roots and goals of Ethnic Studies.
� Ethnic Studies was founded & defined by the struggle of Third World students who were not represented in our colleges & and whose history and role in our nation was excluded. We established programs based on our specific historic Civil Rights struggles as African American, Chicano/Latino, Asian Pacific Americans, and Native American communities
� Asian American Studies at UC included Arab Americans from the beginning. � It is disappointing that Arab American Studies was eliminated from this draft and Pacific Islander
and some Southeast Asians were added as an afterthought. Koreans, Mien, Lao, Bhutanese, Sikhs and others don't have a mention. � The racist attacks of the Trump administration on Muslims and the refugees from the MiddleEast make Arab American Studies more important for all our children now more than ever. I thank Superintendent Thurmond for confirming that Arab Americans will be part of the final curriculum. � While the Board may not accept all of the original draft, it is insulting to eliminate the original educators and community authors from the process.
Thank you for implementing this half-century-long fight to put the story of what is now a majority of Californians into our curriculum. --
