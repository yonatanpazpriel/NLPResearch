Instructional Quality Commission

Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,

I am encouraged to see some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am deeply concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this persistently unacceptable draft of California's ESMC.

My major concerns include: 1) this second draft still does not prevent teaching offensive politically indoctrinating and anti-Israel elements from ESMC's first draft; 2) although some explicitly antisemitic slurs have been removed from the first ESMC draft, the few remaining references to Jews are misleading and offensive; and 3) references to Middle Eastern communities should not favor one community over others.

I am a concerned Californian, professor, and parent of two children being educated in this State, and while I highly endorse an Ethnic Studies curriculum, the latter must be devoid of political indoctrination and stereotypes. Moreover, an important purpose of such a curriculum is to counter racism in our society--and such efforts should also include specific instructional programs on antisemitism as a form of racism and bigotry.

I urge you to please redouble your efforts to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns.

Sincerely,

Jeffrey S. Glenn, M.D., Ph.D.
