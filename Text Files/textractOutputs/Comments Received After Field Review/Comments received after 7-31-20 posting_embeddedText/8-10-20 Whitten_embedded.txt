With time running out before a new curriculum is adopted, I would like to point out several issues which are still unresolved and are an impediment to a comprehensive, fair, inclusive, and positive approach. I have taken an taught social science classes which start with the title "Comparative" that were not one-sided, judgmental and prejudicial. Is this the reality we want to teach out children?
As educators, some of our major concerns include:
� The ESMC guiding values and principles need revision because they are the basis of each unit and lesson plan. In addition, they: o Do not reflect the values laid out in AB 2016, including "the objective of
preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."
o Advocate a narrow political philosophy, as opposed to the CA History Social Science Framework.
o Continue to adopt a divisive tone opposed to the inclusiveness mandated by the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Guidelines.
� This draft does not prevent teaching the same offensive, politically indoctrinating elements from the first draft of the ESMC. We ask that that: o The Elements of Balanced Curriculum from the Los Angeles Unified School District's Ethnic Studies Curriculum be added to the ESMC to provide solid ground rules for course development. Per this document, "At the college and university level, ethnic studies and related courses are sometimes taught from a specific political point of view or frame of reference. In K-12 education it is imperative that students are exposed to multiple perspectives, taught to think critically and form their own opinions on these and other issues." o Remove all divisive content related to critical race theory, which states that "racial inequality emerges from the ... differences that white people create between `races' to maintain elite white interests..." o Numerous sections of the ESMC be revised to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and ensure that "diverse viewpoints are respected." o Numerous sections of the ESMC be revised so that they do not label certain ethnic groups as victims and others as oppressors, creating permanent barriers between students. Rather than building empathy and community, this is likely to stoke resentment, anger and permanent division. This is counter to best practices in pedagogy and everyone's best interest.
� The Asian American section should be factually correct and reflect California's population. o The Asian American section should first include all people from geographicallycorrect countries (i.e., those actually located in Asia), including Indo-American and Korean Americans who are not currently represented.

o After including those groups above, if Middle Eastern communities are then added, they should reflect the broad diversity of these communities in California.
� The list of UC approved courses must be revisited and accompanied by teacher guidance on how to teach exceptionally sensitive subjects without prejudice and bigotry. Examples of the courses listed include: o A course that covers the "philosophy" of Nation of Islam. This group is identified as deeply racist and anti-gay by the Southern Poverty Law Center. o A course about Irish and Jewish Americans, with an assignment for students to write a paper detailing their "gaining racial privilege."
� Thank you for your consideration and commitment to a truly representative approach to teaching our students about the ethnic cultures that make up our diverse society.
