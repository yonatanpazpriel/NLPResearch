Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
Ethnic Studies are more important today than they ever have been. I urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.
Racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as "vectors" of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd all point to the need for anti-racist education: Every student should have comprehensive Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum to build empathy, unity, and solidarity with all peoples.
Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students.
According to findings of Arab Youth Organizing, more than 66% of students surveyed said they received most of their information on Arabs and/or Muslims from the internet or television; only 2.3% learned about Arabs and/or Muslims at school. That needs to change: School should be the source.
Sincerely, Edith Griffin
