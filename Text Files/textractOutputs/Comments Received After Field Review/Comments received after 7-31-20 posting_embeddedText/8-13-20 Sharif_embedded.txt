From: Lila Sharif Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 3:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for Arab American Studies in Ethnic Studies curriculum
I am a product of the LAUSD, and am the first Palestinian American to earn a Ph.D. in Ethnic Studies. I hope the CDE will do the right thing by including Arab American Studies in ES curriculum. To not include Arab American Studies and Palestine Studies in particular will be read as a dark moment in California's education history, and as a method of silencing Arab Americans and Palestinians, especially as Palestinians continue to face the daily subjugation of a militarized occupation by Israel. It is not anti-semitic to critique injustices and progressive Jewish people support this move. Please listen to both them and us. It is not easy to do the right thing, just like it was not easy to include African American histories and experiences in K-12 curriculums during segregation. However, the right thing must be done and that is to allow Arab American Studies and Palestinian history into K-12 education. California, I am asking you, as a product of your education system, to lead the path to justice in education.
