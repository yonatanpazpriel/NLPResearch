From: Lee Gargagliano Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Hello, My name is Lee Goodman-Gargagliano and I am writing as a certificated Adult Ed teacher to offer public comment on the ESMC. I urge to the IQC to approve the Ethnic Studies curriculum as it was initially laid out and to reconvene the initial group who put together the proposal. In particular I am concerned about the elimination of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies and the lack of representation of these communities in developing the curriculum standards. Any Ethnic Studies model curriculum put forward by the state should be based in an Ethnic Studies framework that reflects the field. Furthermore, it should be a process shaped by the communities of color that have historically been marginalized in the constructino of the curriculum.
I know that growing up as a Jewish young person, seeing my identity reflected in pieces of the curriculum I went through was deeply meaningful in providing me a sense of belonging. I think it's incumbent on the state to ensure that Arab and Pacific Islander students have that same experience. It saddens me that the current suggestion before the IQC is not taking up that responsibility.
Sincerely, Lee Gargagliano
