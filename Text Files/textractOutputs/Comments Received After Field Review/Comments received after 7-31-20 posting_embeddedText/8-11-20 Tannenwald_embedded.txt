Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission,
I am a Californian and parent of three children. My youngest is a freshman at our neighborhood public high school.
While I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), I remain concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in the most recent draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns:
-It establishes a divisive us vs. them agenda. Labeling certain ethnic groups exclusively as victims and others as oppressors can create permanent barriers between students. Rather than build empathy and community, it is likely to stoke resentment, anger and permanent division. -It does not include a definition, much less a discussion, of antisemitism, the #1 religious hate crime in the U.S.
The ESMC should be revised to accurately and equitably represent the cultural and racial diversity of California so it is balanced, as required by SBE standards and ESMC Guidelines. The ESMC should promote respect for diverse viewpoints and guidelines to "effectively engage students in productive conversations and learning activities around difficult and important issues".
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Eric Tannenwald Palo Alto
