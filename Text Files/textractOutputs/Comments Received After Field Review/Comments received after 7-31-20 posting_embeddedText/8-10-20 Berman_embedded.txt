From: Writing Tutor Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 12:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Revised Ethnic Studies Plan
To Whom It May Concern
I remain very concerned about the revised curricular plan that tries to hide but fails to address abiding problems. It should not go forward until significant further changes are undertaken.
The current plan does not reflect California values and appears to be structured to increase intergroup hostilities.
It continues to promote narrow political agenda which is not the role of public education
It does not include diverse points of view but instead encourages ideological mobilization. This is not critical thinking.
It downplays the very real threat of antisemitism in California and it largely ignored the many Jewish Californians with ethnic roots in the Middle East
I appreciate that changes have been made that encourage teachers to expose students to varied sources. We should be encouraging students to learn how to evaluate sources and think for themselves. Unfortunately the current version will empower ideologues in the classroom to abuse our students.
I write ad a Californian, a parent, and an educator (I am on the faculty at Stanford University).
Sincerely
Russell A. Berman
