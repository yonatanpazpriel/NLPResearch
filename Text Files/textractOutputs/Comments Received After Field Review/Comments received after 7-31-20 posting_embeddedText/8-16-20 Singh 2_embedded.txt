From: Taranjit Singh Sent: Sunday, August 16, 2020 2:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is a copy of my testimony for the IQC meeting held on Thursday August 13th 2020. Agenda item 2.A.
� My name is Taranjit Singh and I am a Sikh.
� My name is Taranjit Singh and I am a Sikh. I have lived in the Bay Area for 20 years. I am a software engineer. Both my children go to school in Fremont USD. Inclusivity of communities makes people feel seen. Continuing to ignore the rich contributions that Sikhs have made to California over the past 125 years, is a disservice to all of us, and especially to our kids. Our narrative has been left out for far too long. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, supports more meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum.
� The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
