Dear members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I was pleased to see commendable improvements to the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in the recommendations made last week by the CDE. Most of the explicit antisemitic and anti-Israel content has been removed. Some additional guidance has been added to encourage teachers to expose students to "multiple and often competing sources of information" and foster respect for diverse viewpoints, rather than promote a particular political or ideological view. And local school districts are encouraged to be transparent and actively seek public input as they implement this ethnic studies curriculum in local classrooms. This is all commendable. That said, I believe some additional modifications are still needed. I would like to see the curriculum more fully represent the ethnic diversity of the Jewish community, particularly Jews of Color and Mizrachi Jews, as well as other minorities represented in California's population. Additional lesson material on contemporary antisemitism is needed, within the body of the curriculum, for a fuller understanding of racism and discrimination in America, (particularly in light of the fact that hate crimes against Jews have risen by 71% since 2016, and Jews continue to be the #1 targets of religious based hate crimes in California). Additional safeguards, such as adding Los Angeles Unified School District Balanced Curriculum guidelines, are still needed to discourage political bias in classrooms. Thank you for considering this as you meet on August 13. Sincerely, Sarit Schube Palo Alto resident and mother of 4
