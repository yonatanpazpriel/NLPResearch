From: Victoria Wong <vwongqi@ Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 1:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment 2.A.3. Support Original Ethnic Studies MC Draft
For Public Comment, Agenda Item 2.A.3.
I'm Victoria Wong, I cofounded the Asian American Political Alliance in 1968, which originated the term and concept of Asian American, and cofounded Asian American Studies/Ethnic Studies at UC Berkeley. I support the original draft because it supports our guiding principles, values and goals of a relevant, true and empowering education. Let the original draft authors, who are experienced and dedicated Third World teachers from our communities--who are the majority of public school students--strengthen the draft. Keep Pacific Islander, Arab American, West Asian American Studies including Palestine as essential parts of Asian American Studies. Expand Central American Studies under Chicanx/Latinx Studies. You in the IQC today will impact the future of race relations. If you accept the backward-thinking CDE revision that perpetuates white Eurocentric brainwashing, you will be setting back the march of progress to the pre-civil rights era. Instead, put our youth and humanity's future as foremost in your vote. Break the chains of white supremacy in our schools. Emancipate our children and let them breathe! Thank you.
Respectfully, Victoria Wong Cofounder - Asian American Political Alliance (AAPA); Asian American Studies/Ethnic Studies UC Berkeley; Third World Liberation Front Striker
