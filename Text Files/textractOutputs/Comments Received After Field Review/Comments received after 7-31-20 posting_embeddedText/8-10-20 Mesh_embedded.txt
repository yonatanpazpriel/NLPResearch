Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am a parent in the Palo Alto School district and need to express my concerns. Ethnic Studies is important and I appreciate your tackling this. Some of the proposed improvements to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) however are troubling and outright flawed.
Jews and especially Jews of color are misrepresented. The curriculum does not promote harmony and understanding of Jews- only continues to foster hate. We must teach the next generation how to get along in harmony and provide an example curriculum for the rest of the world which teaches critical thinking. Critical thinking with a unifying message is the first step towards obtaining harmony.
I am troubled by the links to foster hate of and bias against Jews, Jews of Color and Israel. links to only BDS sites is disturbing. BDS aims to divide and foster rather than incite harmony. BDS espouses the destruction of Israel. This is not something to teach lightly.
A curriculum that stereotypes Jews as sinister only fosters hate.
We need to offer our children a better solution. We need to incorporate positive perspectives of all religions. We must teach our children to understand differences in a positive light and ask the students to focus on commonalities BDS teaches Hate! We're just promoting an agenda.
If there is a "slant" to our ethnic studies, it should be to teach our next generation how to get along. How to understand commonalities between communities,
The Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC should use precise and inclusive terminology. It should adhere to the ESMC Guidelines which is to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking.
I'd be happy to discuss this further. You are welcome to call me.
Thank you, Randie Mesh Palo Alto, CA
