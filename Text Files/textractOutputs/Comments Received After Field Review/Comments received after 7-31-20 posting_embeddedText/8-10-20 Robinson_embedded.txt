From: Oren Robinson Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Re: MESC this Thursday, 8/13
Hello,
My name is Oren and I am calling Instructional Quality Commission regarding the model ethnic studies curriculum.
I am a Jewish San Diego resident, and a member of Jewish Voice for Peace San Diego Chapter, as well as the progressive educators' network Educate for the Future (EFF).
This Thursday, August 13th, I urge you to include Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the California Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
The current revision leaves out Arab American studies, which was a part of the original curriculum. Leaving it out is unacceptable and will deprive the next generation of students of important knowledge that is critical to understanding their own histories and current political realities.
My neighboring assembly district is Dr. Shirley Weber, and when I last spoke with Dr. Weber about this at her office months ago, she emphasized how Ethnic Studies is not multicultural studies.
California is a home of the early Ethnic Studies movement and I want our children to have a liberatory and world-class education -- and that demands that both Arab American and Pacific Islander Studies be reinstated. I'd also urge that the original writers must be reconvened for feedback prior to the November revisions.
Thank you,
