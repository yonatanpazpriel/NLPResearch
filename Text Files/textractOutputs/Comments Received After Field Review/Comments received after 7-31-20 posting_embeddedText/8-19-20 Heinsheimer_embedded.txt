My parents were both born in Germany. I am a first generation German Jewish American with strong ties to the state of Isreal and the organized Jewish community in the SF bay area. I urge you to go back to the ethnic studies requirement first presented to CDE when Arab American studies and the mentioning of BDS is mentioned as a social justice movement is taught. One thing we have learned lately is how much history my generation, the baby boomers and our children's generation did not learn. It is time for our grandchildren to learn about systemic racism which would include the racialization of Arabs, muslims and especially palestinians. Please allow ethnic studies professors to design the curriculum not fearful anxious Jews who though they are right to be wary of antisemitism and want it taught should be aware that a lot of history is taught about the holocaust. It is time for us to not let fear or money design curriculum. Please the way to improve our world, is to educate our children about what is true. No one is denying systemic racism, so lets be real and teach it. thanks you. J GAbriella Heinsheimer MD
