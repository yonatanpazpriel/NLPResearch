From: Becky Rosenheim Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 12:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
My name is Rebecca Rosenheim and I am a California resident, voter and parent.
I am concerned about the second draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), which although improved, still contains anti-Semitic and anti-Israel references, and is one-sided and divisive, pitting different ethnic groups against one another, with certain groups described exclusively as victims and others as oppressors. Additionally, the current ESMC draft includes no definition of anti-Semitism, which is the #1 hate crime in the United States.
Our children and our country deserve better. Please revise the ESMC to accurately and fairly represent California's racial and ethnic diversity as required by SBE guidelines and ESMC Standards.
