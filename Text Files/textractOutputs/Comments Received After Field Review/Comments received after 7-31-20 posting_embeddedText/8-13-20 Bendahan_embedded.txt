From: Vicki Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 3:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American students need to learn their histories
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
My name is Vicki, teaching public health at City College of San Francisco for many years. I was one of 25 faculty members from across our college who sent a letter of strong support for the original Ethnic Studies curriculum. We strongly support the inclusion of Arab American and Pacific Islander studies in the state model curriculum.
Content upholding Palestinian self-determination is in no way anti-semitic--this is a false equivalency designed to silence a widening criticism of the violence of the Israeli state. Your committee has been targeted by political pressure by the Israeli lobby, and we urge you to hold to your principles to realize the original curriculum.
The curriculum should be formulated by Ethnic Studies scholars and practitioners, and we urge you to reconvene the original advisory committee of experts.
This is a time of the biggest uprising in US history against racism--this is a moment when a strong curriculum should be put on a solid and permanent foundation.
Sincerely, Vicki
