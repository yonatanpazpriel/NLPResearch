From: Mike Gilfix Sent: Saturday, August 8, 2020 6:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Misleading Anti-Israel, Anti-Semitic content in ESMC proposals; AB 2016
Dear Friends,
We are California residents of over 40 years. We raised 3 children, all of whom were educated in California. We are deeply disturbed by the current ESMC proposals that are to implement AB 2016.
We are writing to encourage you to again review the ESMC guiding values. While progress has been made in reducing the level of anti-Israel and anti-Semitic bias in the guidelines, they remain dangerously inappropriate.
They take political positions based on false premises. Specifically, the guidelines now refer to, support, and legitimize BDS by referencing outright falsehoods about Israel and its history. The BDS "movement," as stated on its website, is devoted to the elimination of Israel, nothing less.
The Guidelines should respect the purpose of AB 2016 and treat all ethnic groups with respect.
The Guidelines should support educators and students who, above all, must foster critical thinking skills. The current guidelines go in exactly the opposite direction.
The guidelines ignore the fact that there are countless Jews of color, all of whom are degraded by the current guidelines.
The ESMC has a grave responsibility. The ESMC must ignore the voices that have clearly influenced the guideline drafting process to vilify only one group: Jews and those who support Israel's right to exist.
