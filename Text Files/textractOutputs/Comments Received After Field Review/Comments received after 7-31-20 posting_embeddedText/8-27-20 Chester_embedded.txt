I'm a retired 35 year public school teacher/administrator who has come to view public education very differently now. Tolerance was a "catch" phrase for several years which I despise now because the people who "scream" tolerance have turned out to be the most intolerant people, thinking it is their way or you are being prejudiced. Women, blacks, and gender confused are not the only ones who have been discriminated against, I do not hear the Native Americans, WWII Japanese, early Irish and Italians expressing mistreatment! Each person needs to rise above all the unfairnesses of life and not constantly find fault or cry. I am proud that I am White and male that many others try to denigrate just because. It was the while man from early revolutionary times of this country that fought for our freedoms, acknowledged their failures and worked to make it more equal. Political "correctness" is ridiculous. I am happy to hear that individuals have spoken out about the biased view of certain ethnic groups and it should be a study that has to be fair for all, not just developed from the far left view point!
