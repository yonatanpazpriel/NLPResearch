Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, I welcome some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am very concerned by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns with what I saw:
The few references to Jews are misleading and offensive. � Remove links to, and group advocacy of, virulently anti-Israel pro-BDS sites with malicious slander � about imaginary genocide � Include Mizrahi and other Jews of color � Add a definition of antisemitism � to address various contemporary manifestations of antisemitism, including � stereotyping and double standards against Jews and Jewish institutions from all parts of the political spectrum. � Add specific lesson materials on antisemitism as a form of racism and bigotry
I am a parent of a 5th grader. My three older kids have been exposed to antisemitism during their high school years and had to encounter other students' utter ignorance of the Arab Israeli conflict and Jewish history many times. This issue affects our family personally. I ask you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you,
