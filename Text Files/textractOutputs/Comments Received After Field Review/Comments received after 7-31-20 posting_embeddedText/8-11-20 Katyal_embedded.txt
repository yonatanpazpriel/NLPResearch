From: Elana Katyal Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 8:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Say no to hate and misinformation in schools
Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I applaud some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I am upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns: Israel hate causes anti-Semitism.
I am a California taxpayer who seems my kids to private school because I don't want them Taught twisted and untrue history.
My concerns are the misrepresentation of Jews and other ethnic groups and the imposing a one-sided political ideology. I urge the revision of the Guiding Values and Principles, since all lessons are based on them.
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles. Thank you, Elana Palo Alto, California
