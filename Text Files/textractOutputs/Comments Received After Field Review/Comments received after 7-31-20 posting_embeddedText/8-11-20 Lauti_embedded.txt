From: John Lauti Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 10:30 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pacific Islander and Arab Ethnic Studies Curriculum Inclusion
Good morning,
As a Pacific Islander and native of California, it is disheartening to know that the revised version of the ESMC has excluded Pacific Islander and Arab communities from the curriculum.
We feel strongly that the state of California is doing a disservice to our Pacific Islander and Arab students by not including these communities in the curriculum. It is crucial that the curriculum being taught reflects the faces of the students sitting in the classroom.
We urge you to reconsider this decision to ensure that our communities are represented in our curriculum and in our schools.
Thank you, John
