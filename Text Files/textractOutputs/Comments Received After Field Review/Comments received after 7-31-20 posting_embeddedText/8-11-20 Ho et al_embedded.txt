California K-12 Educators Statement of Support of
Arab American Studies, West Asian Studies, and
Palestine in ESMC
We as California K-12 educators know firsthand the power of a curriculum that acknowledges, reflects, and affirms student identities in the classroom.
 We know that when students' experiences and ancestral legacies are made visible to them in school, they are more likely to engage with content, and thus are more likely to succeed academically and grow emotionally (Smith 2018).
 We know that when students have a bridge�rather than a disconnect�between their home life, language, and identity, and school life, they feel empowered to be vulnerable, to learn, and to hope (Sleeter 2011).
 We also know that when students learn and witness the experiences and ancestral legacies of their classmates, connections are built and there is a positive development in understanding the world beyond their own perspectives and lives (Carmona and Bernal 2012).
This pedagogical approach works (Tintiangco-Cubales et al., 2014), and yet there are many students who are still not reflected in the curriculum�particularly students of West Asian ancestry. In a survey conducted among ninth grade students in the Oakland area who had taken an Ethnic Studies class, "A rab American students most disagreed with the statement that the courses offered to them reflected their history and culture" (Davies Samway 2020). While Ethnic Studies' aim is to reflect all students' communities and to critique the dominant narrative of our country (Yosso 2002), c urriculum gaps like this continue to exist. As educators, we believe it is our job to continually expand upon the wealth and scope of narratives from which we teach in order to close such gaps. If we are to teach and care for all of our students equitably, West Asian American historical narratives and students' current lived experiences must be present in the curriculum. Their lives are part of our c ollective history (Takaki 1993), and our collective hxstories and herstories as well, which are purposeful alternate spellings we also use in Ethnic Studies, and which should remain in the model curriculum.

We acknowledge that discussions of this area of the world can be politically fraught and thus difficult to navigate. We cannot, however, allow this to interfere with our students' lives, and cause students to feel that their existence is politically fraught and difficult to navigate. We cannot perpetuate the fear that students' personal and familial experiences with the Muslim Ban and immigration detention, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, surveillance and criminalization, territorial disputes, and refugee status are inappropriate or too complicated to be taught in their classes. We acknowledge that there is much work to be done in order to better educate ourselves and to adequately teach these stories in a manner that is humanizing and identity-affirming (del Carmen Salazar 2013). We have chosen to lean into that work instead of cower from it.
In support of our West Asian American students and communities, we as California K-12 educators:
 Support the original Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft as Ethnic Studies, and specifically Asian American Studies, which is work that thinks through colonialism, imperialism, and racialization.
 Affirm using the G uiding Values, Principles, and Outcomes of Teaching Ethnic Studies as the core of the curriculum, its reference throughout, and that all lessons and lesson templates should be aligned to it--this is Ethnic Studies.
 Affirm that West Asian American Studies is Asian American Studies, as Asian American Studies is work that thinks through colonialism, imperialism, and racialization. West Asian American Studies has precedence in Asian American Studies (Maira and Shihade 2006).
 Defend Arab American Studies and Palestine as Ethnic Studies, as Asian American Studies is work that thinks through colonialism, imperialism, and racialization. Any Asian-American Studies must get to the heart of issues of power and oppression.
 Agree that the curriculum must engage scholars and communities directly on the portions that address them.
 Believe that the original writers of the curriculum must be consulted in order to stay true to the charge of Ethnic Studies to dismantle white supremacy, epistemic violence, and erasure.
