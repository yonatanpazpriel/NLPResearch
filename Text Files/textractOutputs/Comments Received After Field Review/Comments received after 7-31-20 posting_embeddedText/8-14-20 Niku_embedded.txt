� � Dear IQC Members,
�
� Firstly, thank you for your work revising the ESMC. I know this is a difficult task with many different constituencies, but I appreciate your efforts and that you have committed to a curriculum that strives to represent the diversity of California.
� My family immigrated from Iran, Tehran specifically, to California. Before coming to the United States as a stateless refugee, my mother spent 6 years under house arrest in Iran for the "crime" of being a Jew. Thanks to her perspective, I have never taken for granted the freedom America has offered me or my family. I was born and raised in California, and it will always be my home. I myself am a successful product of the California public school system, and I fully intend to educate my own children in public schools.
� I would like to note my concerns about the lack of Mizrahi Jewish representation in this curriculum. The various appendices do not reflect my community's experiences in any capacity � the references to the Jewish community talk about Californian Jews as if we are all white, and all references to Iranians assume refugees from the Ayatollahs' brutal regime are Muslim. Neither are true, and yet I find myself explaining my community's existence and trauma to the state that we have transformed.
� I encourage you to incorporate more robust instructional material on antisemitism, especially antisemitism in the MENA region. Some standout suggestions are Eric K. Ward, Yad Vashem: The World Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, JIMENA, and the ADL. All are credible resources to address these shortcomings in any revisions. Thank you.
