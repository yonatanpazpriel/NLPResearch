Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am a mother of three school aged children in the Dublin Unified School District (2 at Dublin Elementary and 1 at Wells Middle), and while I appreciate some improvement in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), I am upset by the imposition of the offensive, one-sided political ideology that still remains in this flawed draft of California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Here are my major concerns
the revisions do not reflect California's shared values, nor the values laid out in AB 2016 the revisions advocate a narrow political philosophy the revisions establish an "us vs them" agenda the revisions partly based on the book Education at War, which encourages "solidarity" and "linkages" with BDS, and anti-Israel narratives, harmful to many Jewish students
This would affect us personally as we are Jewish, and as a grandchild of Holocaust survivors we are very sensitive to the idea that once again Jewish people are being "othered".
I urge you to make significant further revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking. Then adjust the lessons and sample topics accordingly to match the revised principles.
Thank you, Arielle Kurtze
Dublin, CA
