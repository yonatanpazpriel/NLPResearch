From: Joe Nalven Sent: Thursday, August 13, 2020 3:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Item 2.A.1 ESMC Comment to today's hearing
My name is Joseph Nalven, Ph.D.
I am an educator and teach cultural anthropology.
I have taught at the San Diego Community College District and the University of San Diego for more than 15 years.
Half of this curriculum's Guiding Values and Principles promote a specific, narrow political ideology.
The political indoctrination here happens to be Neo-Marxist dogma, but it doesn't matter whether it's indoctrination on the right or left.
ANY one-sided political indoctrination is in direct conflict with the History-Social Science Framework (HSSF) for California Public Schools, 2016, and the Common Core State Standards 2010.
It is worth noting that the History-Social Science Framework states that curriculum must include "A balance of topics, authors, and concepts, including primary and secondary sources that represent multiple, and sometimes opposing, points of view or perspectives."
For example, if we take attitudes on interracial marriage. Back in 1958, only 4% of Americans approved of interracial marriage. In 2016, that number has skyrocketed to 87%. As an educator, the issue is not whether one agrees with interracial marriage or not, BUT rather that change in society should be noted and discussed. That kind of understanding is not reflected in the ESMC.
Understanding racism and ethnic identity does not require political ideology evangelism. There are numerous admired Ethnic Studies offerings in California and elsewhere which encourage social

responsibility not political indoctrination; that is the path ESMC should follow.
Please revise the principles, framework and materials accordingly.
