From: Gabriel P Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 9:53 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Hi, my name is Gabriel Pernell and I go to Venice high school. Thank you so much for the opportunity to speak today. I am half African, half white, and Jewish. However, I sometimes don't immediately tell others that I am Jewish, in fear of facing anti-Semitism.
This fear is not unique to me. If the ethnic studies curriculum does not fairly represent Jews and the many groups it ignores or barely mentions, like Armenians and Hindus, it will enable ignorance and even hatred among students.
I see the importance of ethnic studies, it is crucial to be educated about the people that make up our diverse state. The curriculum has an important responsibility. In order to help students understand each other, they must be informed about one another. Being informed about many ethnicities and cultures can also help to dissolve many stereotypes that exist in society.
I hope that this curriculum can help to shed light on the ethnicities and cultures that are not often talked about. Ideally, students will be able to see themselves fairly represented in the curriculum. Personally, I can't remember ever learning about African-American Jews in school.
I'm sure many students from underrepresented ethnicities would feel ecstatic and empowered to see themselves in the curriculum. As your constituent, I hope you will revise the ESMC so it includes Jewish students like me.
Thank you!
