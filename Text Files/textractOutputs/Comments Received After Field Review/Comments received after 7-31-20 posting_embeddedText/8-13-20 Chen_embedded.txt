I am a filmmaker, data analyst, creator of the social media platform BayRich. Ethnic studies is my minor - my father also took ethnic studies.
It was through Arab studies where I learned arabic, the diction, studying Arab culture through language and film. Similar to Pacific Islander studies, I learned the history and experiences with colonialism, imperialism, westernization, destroying the cultures and languages of pacific islander peoples.
We need both Arab American studies and Pacific Islander studies part of the model curriculum because it can help build bridges, prevent the spread of disinformation. We need representation.
But most importantly, we can make our world a safer, loving, and nurturing place, through educating & understand each other. And that's why I'm fighting for it.
