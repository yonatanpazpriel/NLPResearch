Dear members of the IQC,
I am submitting the comment I made by phone to you by email as well. Thank you for your consideration.
My comment:
My name is Max, I'm calling from Los Angeles. I want to express gratitude for changes made to the curriculum and support its focus on the Black, Latino, Asian and Native American communities.
I also want to raise a very important change that still needs to be made to make sure this curriculum achieves its stated goals.
You have received a letter from a coalition of Middle Eastern communities that represent 500,000 Californians. They are asking for inclusion alongside Arab Americans in a broad unit about Middle Eastern or West Asian communities.
Given your announcement last night, this has become even more critical. Ironically, in a curriculum which speaks about critiquing imperialism, the erasure of these communities reproduces a long history of imperialism in the Middle East.
Jews, Kurds, Assyrian Christians and so many others have suffered centuries of colonization and oppression as minority groups in that region. In California, we should empower all Middle Eastern communities to work together, overcome that history, and chart a better path forward. A unit which focuses on Arab Americans to the exclusion of others will do the opposite.
