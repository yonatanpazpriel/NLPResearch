From: Todd Berman Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 3:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not remove Arab Americans from our states curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment,
I am a Jewish educator who works with public schools in San Francisco. California is home to many Arab refugees who need to be able to learn about the struggles of their own communities.
I urge you to support the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.
Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.
Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes for students.
In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump's Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.
Sincerely, Todd Berman
