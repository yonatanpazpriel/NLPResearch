From: Jagdeep Sahota Sent: Friday, August 14, 2020 9:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sikh inclusion in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is a copy of my testimony for the IQC meeting held on Thursday August 13th 2020. Agenda item 2.A.
� My name is Jagdeep Singh Sahota and I am a Sikh.
� My name is Jagdeep Singh and I am a Sikh living in Stockton, California. I am a graduate of the public school system and am now a parent to a child in Lammersville USD - I do not want the next generation to be bullied and misunderstood in the same way that I was. In the latest curriculum, Sikhs are only mentioned once in the context of discrimination after 9/11. Only encountering certain communities through victimization results in continued flattening and dehumanizing. We must use this opportunity to counter the narrative, learn more about marginalized populations and build empathy among students. The emailed petition, signed by 1220 Sikh community members in California, supports more meaningful Sikh inclusion in the curriculum.
� The email petition submitted by the Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement, signed by 1220 Sikh community members, supports more meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, through a lesson plan which teachers can use to teach about the positive and rich contributions by Sikhs in California over the past 125 years. The Sikh American experience should not be reduced to a narrative which only portrays the community through the lens of victimization post 9/11. It is clear that the IQC is willing to take this approach given the recent commitment to include lesson plans on the Pacific Islander experience and Arab American Studies. The Sikh community's requests should not continue to be ignored.
Regards, Jagdeep
