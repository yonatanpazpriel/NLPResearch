I support this effort and agree it should be required of all HS students. I do think we need to answer the questionwhat will be taken off the plate of HS students? Over the years I have watched the requirements grow and grow and nothing has been removed to y knowledge. Subjects/courses need to be prioritized as to what is mandatory and assure it is reasonable. Thank you Joann Merrick Ed.D. Retired Deputy Superintendent Glendale
