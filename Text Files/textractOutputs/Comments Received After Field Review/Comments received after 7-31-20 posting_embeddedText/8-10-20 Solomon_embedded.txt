Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education,
I am appreciative of the improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), but I still remain concerned about by the present Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Here are my major concerns . It continues to lack reference to Mizrachi and other Jews of color. It continues to subtly advocate for virulently anti-Israel pro BDS sites that include malicious slander about imaginary genocide. It is also essential that there is a lesson plan, "Antisemitism as the Middle Eastern American Jews, covering contemporary issues of antisemitism, bigotry, and the Middle Eastern -American Jewish experience produced by JIMENA: Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North America. As a parent of a high school student, I believe fair representation of all ethnic groups is essential to the repair of divisions that exist in our society. I there for ask you to make significant revisions of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to address these concerns.
Thank you,
Ilene Simon Solomon
