From: Emma Hartung Sent: Tuesday, August 11, 2020 7:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Superintendent Subject: In support of ESMC & Arab American Studies
Dear Commission,
I am writing again in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and specifically the inclusion of Arab American Studies, in advance of this Thursday's meeting and vote.
As political tensions continue to rise across the country, it has never been clearer that all California students need to see themselves represented in the curriculum, including Arab American and Palestinian American students, and that all students desperately need to be exposed to as many histories as possible in order to be able to respond to these challenging times with tolerance and collaboration instead of xenophobia or hate.
I hope the commission will take full advantage of this opportunity by approving the ESMC with Arab American Studies and Palestine included!
Warmly, Emma Hartung Santa Clara, CA
