From: Gail Michaelis-Ow Sent: Monday, August 10, 2020 2:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Suggestions for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum...
Dear Instructional Quality Commission of the California Board of Education, While there are some improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), more work needs to be done. Young people must be helped to think for themselves; not told what their politics should be in our country nor the Middle East. As a Jewish American, I am concerned about the way Jewish Americans and the State of Israel are portrayed. Anti semitism must be addressed along with sensitivity to other ethnicities and religions. My husband is Chinese American and the history of the Chinese Exclusion Act as well as the Holocaust must be covered. Please make significant revisions to address these concerns. Thank you! Gail Michaelis-Ow [address redacted] Santa Cruz, California
