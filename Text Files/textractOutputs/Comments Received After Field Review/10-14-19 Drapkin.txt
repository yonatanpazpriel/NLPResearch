BDS Movement � Your explanation of the movement left off one of the purposes of the movement: The destruction of Israel. I refer you to their charter. How does this movement support the ideals of Ethnic Studies??
The new model does not fulfill the ideals of ethnic studies, whereby the many diverse members of America see themselves and the contributions they have made to make the dream a reality for all. Some of the lessons are constructive, but there are glaring examples of propaganda. It seems that new people hired at CDE have brought their agenda with them. No where in the document is there any mention of the process of logic. Having grown up in Boyle Heights, teaching in Watts, Hollywood High and the Valley, I have always provided opportunities for all my students to know themselves through art, literature, history and politics and to share that knowledge with others. I also taught them to QUESTION, READ ALL OPINIONS and TO CHALLENGE IDEAS. This curriculum ignores these tenets. I am disappointed. Needs more work.
