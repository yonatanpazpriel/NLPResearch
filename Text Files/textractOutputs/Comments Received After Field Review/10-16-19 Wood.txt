I disagree with this curriculum it does not represent the values of what I teach my grandchildren. It equates capitalism with white nationalism, racism and requires students to read a the book convicted murderer of a police officer who resides in Cuba to avoid justice. This represents no constitutional rights as granted in the founding documents and the Bill of Rights. I vote no on this program.
