From: Adrianna [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 12:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish representation in ethnic studies
Dear California Department of Education,
I am writing because I do not support the proposed ethnic studies curriculum due to its dangerous antisemitic language which conflates Jewish identity with privilege.
Jewish people should be the ones who define their identity, and should be the ones deciding how they are represented in California's schools curriculum.
Until the curriculum is revised, to properly represent Jewish identity and history, the proposal should not move forward.
Please see link below for a full explanation of why the proposed curriculum is problematic for Jews, and the suggested revisions.
Sincerely,
Adrianna Morsey [address redacted]
