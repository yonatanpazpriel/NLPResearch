To Whom It May Concern,
I am reading your proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum and while I have not finished it I feel I must immediately comment on this curriculum, which is perpetuating the myth that "Jew" is an ethnicity -- it is not, it is a religion. Your comment
is inaccurate.
In addition, you continue by claiming
also is inaccurate. Jews come from all over the world so there is no language connection. All that connects Jews is the religion.
With such comments and thinking you are not advancing an understanding of Jews and Judaism but you are feeding into one of the underlying ideas of antisemitism, that it is an ethnicity. If it were one could not convert to Judaism and, in fact, one can. You are not helping with such thinking and commentary.
Please fix this.
