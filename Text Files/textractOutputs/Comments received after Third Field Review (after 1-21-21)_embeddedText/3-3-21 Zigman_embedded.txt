From: Rosalie Zigman Sent: Wednesday, March 3, 2021 12:36 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concern for anti-semitism and anti-Israel bias of this requirement
As a Long Beach resident and grandparent to eight, I am concerned with the current draft of the ethnic studies curriculum. While the objective is laudable, the foundations are faulty. The agenda is political and not educational. If a statewide requirement is deemed necessary, it should be rebuilt from the ground up.
Please do NOT approve this as a requirement!
Sincerely,
Rosalie Zigman
