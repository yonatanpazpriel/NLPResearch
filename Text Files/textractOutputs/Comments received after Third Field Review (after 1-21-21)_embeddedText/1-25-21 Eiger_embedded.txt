Good evening,
Please remove the antisemitism from your ethnic studies curriculum. Labeling Jews as privileged falls into antisemitic tropes and encourages violence against Jewish people. "Jewish Privilege" is a term used by David Duke. This is egregious and must be fixed immediately.
Thank you, Danielle Eiger
