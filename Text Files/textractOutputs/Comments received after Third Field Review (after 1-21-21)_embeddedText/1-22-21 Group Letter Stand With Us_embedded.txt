I urge you to revise the ESMC to:
1. Remove content that celebrates or glorifies current and historical figures who who have promoted antisemitism and other destructive ideas. 2. Define antisemitism in a way that covers all forms of this hatred and reflects the real-life experiences of Jewish students and communities. 3. Ensure all sections and lesson plans align with the standards in chapter 1 regarding critical thinking and how to teach ethnic studies in a K-12 environment.
I also urge you to REJECT:
1. Demands to exclude or edit down any definition of antisemitism to the point where it no longer reflects the experiences of Jewish students and communities. 2. Pressure to favor any single community over others. Arabs, Jews Armenians, Sikhs, and others should be treated equally in the ESMC. 3. Recommendations to reverse changes that encourage critical thinking instead of one sided political agendas in the curriculum.
I add my name in support of the StandWithUs December 2020 ESMC Analysis and Recommendations.
Sincerely,Judy Submission ID
