In fairness TeachersThat are Jewish should review this part of the curriculum. I noticed who the board is Comprised of and there is a majority of people from San Francisco in certain schools. I believe there should be a more uniform fair committee made up of people from all different parts of the states and colleges and philosophy. Also a teacher that is famiar with Judaism should be on the advisory committee There is a basis within the committee
