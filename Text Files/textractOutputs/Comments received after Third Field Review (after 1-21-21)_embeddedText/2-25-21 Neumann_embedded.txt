Hello,
I am the parent of three children and recently found out about the new Ethnic Studies Curriculum. This is really great news and I am thankful that our Department of Education is pursuing the implementation of this incredibly important subject. I wish that I had known of this sooner so that my comment could be within the public comment period that you decided upon. Even though it is past the date that your department determined (this is without any previous announcement from our school district), it is still important to provide you with some parental feedback.
I am hoping that your department is intending to include the subject of Faith within the Ethnic Studies curriculum, as it is intertwined with this topic. It plays a key role in a broad spectrum of ethnicities, not only today, but also historically. Some faiths and/or religions also seem to shape & define the overall culture of ethnic groups. This is a significant aspect of all sorts of peoples. Please don't forget to include this incredibly important piece of the whole picture.
Once again, thank you for the opportunity to be a voice in this process and for your informed consideration. Even though it's technically past the set deadline, I am sure your department still sees the stakeholders' comments as valuable.
Thank you, Nina
