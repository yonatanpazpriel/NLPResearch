In "The Autobiography of Malcolm X As Told To Alex Haley" Malcolm tells about an event which explained to me the reaction of a black tenth grader when I said that Jesus was a Jew. This young man loudly proclaimed that Jesus was not a Jew but that he was black. On page 306 Malcolm tells about a white reporter. "I can't remember how , or why, he somehow happened to mention the Dead Sea Scrolls. I came back with something like, 'Yes, those scrolls are going to take Jesus off the stained-glass windows and the frescoes where he has been lily white, and put Him back into the true mainstream of history where Jesus actually was non-white.' The reporter was surprised, and I went on that the Dead Sea Scrolls were going to reaffirm that Jesus was a member of that brotherhood of Egyptian seers called the Essene - a fact already known from Philo, the famous Egyptian historian of Jesus' time." So since Malcolm believed that Jesus was Egyptian it explains why he said that the Jews took Israel from the Arabs who are the rightful owners. However, Philo was a Jewish historian and the Dead Sea Scrolls are a history of Jewish life in the land of Israel. If you can find a reputable historian who supports Malcolm's version please let me know. Meanwhile, I believe that this distortion of the facts should not be taught on any college campus, and any teacher who promotes this fiction should be fired.
