Antifa and Black Lives Matter are not the enemy, Ruth. When was the last time either of these groups stole money from you in taxes, criminalized you for what you choose do with your own body, or tried to subject you to a non-science-based public health "lockdown"? People yell all kinds of things, and say all kinds of things online. But it is those in power, not the people on the streets, who are acting as tyrants.
The ruling statists must be delighted at seeing all the partisans on both the right and the left demonizing each other's grassroots activists and protesters. The animosity between "team red" and "team blue" is their bread-and-butter ï¿½ it helps them raise money, stay in power, and fuel public fears that allow them to expand government control at the expense of grassroots left-wingers, right-wingers, and libertarians alike.

What is extremely frustrating to me is that the media claims that Antifa/BLM "mostly peaceful" insurgency riots were not limited to "last summer" but have continued to this day in cities across the country including DC and when they yell "burn it down" they mean it because they have done just that. And they have injured and killed more people, including police officers, and destroyed more government property (not to mention private property) than were killed and destroyed in the January 6th "insurgency." The coverage is incredibly biased. Will Trump's lawyers make this point at the impeachment hearing? I hope so. The American people have a right to know the facts.
