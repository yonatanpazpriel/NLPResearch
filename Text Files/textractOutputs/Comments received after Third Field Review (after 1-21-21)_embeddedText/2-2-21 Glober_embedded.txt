Name: David Glober Email: [redacted] Organization:US Jewish Citizen Job Title: Subject: School Curriculum Phone:[redacted] Comment: PROPOSED CA CURRICULUM ON ETHNICITY & RACE RE: INACCURATE AND DANGEROUS PORTRAYAL OF US JEWS Jews do not have racial privilege or white privilege in the same ways that non-minority whites have. The wording in the new Curriculum is skewed and puts Jews in America and the State of Israel in very serious danger. It must be revised to show the nuances that exist. And genetically Jews are Middle Eastern and more related to Palestinians than to white Americans. White privilege for Jews has -always- been a two-edged sword along with -immense- pressures to assimilate so much that we renounce our identities as Jews. It's always been a mix of both in the US. To tell the truth, it is necessary to tell the whole truth.
