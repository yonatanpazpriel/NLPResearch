To whom it may concern:
Please revise the Jewish ethnic studies curriculum by consulting with the Jewish community. As an an educator, I cannot in good conscience teach this curriculum knowing that many people in the Jewish community criticize this curriculum for omitting crucial information and providing inaccurate descriptions of Jewish history and contemporary Jewish culture. Please refer to this Instagram post for a critique of the curriculum, as defined by Jewish people. Jewish people should determine how they are defined.
