Hello, I have read a facts sheet of the new curriculum, particularly on Jewish people, and I find it very problematic and unacceptable. I expect changes to be made in this regard before the new curriculum is released. For example, the curriculum actively ignores the fact that the Jewish people's is not an inherently white race but an ethnic-religion withers the people are Judean. Therefore your curriculum actively ignores Jewish people of color and assumes all Jewish people are ashkenazi (Eastern European). it makes incorrect assumptions about antisemitism and anti-Zionism and has a very narrow American scope on the Jewish peoples.
Thankyou for your time, Ashley Harding of LA County
