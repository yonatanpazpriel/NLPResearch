You must tone down the new ethnic studies curriculum to be more balanced and not demonize Jews. It is unconscionable what you are doing. And where is MLK? He had a huge respect for Jews and what they did to help the Civil Rights movement in the '60's, and continue to do with the Black Lives Matter movement. Where is the balance?
