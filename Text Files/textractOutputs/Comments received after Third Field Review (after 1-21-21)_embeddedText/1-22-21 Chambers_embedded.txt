I object to the Ethnic Studies 3rd draft. The 3rd draft is written from the perspective of Critical Theory with an intent to radicalize Students for a political movement that seeks to undermine America. Teaching students to view themselves as divided into categories by their skin color, then into opposing forces of oppressor or oppressed, and then instructing them to take their places in society as agents of change for Social Justice, " parallels the Marxist-Leninist-Mao strategy used over and over again to weaken and then overthrow countries they have conquered. Over 100 million people have been murdered by Communist governments,. Today over 1 million Uigers in China are in concentration camps, deprived of their freedom, brutally and mercilessly tortured, starved. Slave labor, organ harvesting. China has been supporting radical groups in America who's leaders publicly affirm to be trained Marxists. Said leaders are the leaders of Black Lives Matter. The 3rd draft is violating numerous state and federal laws by using Critical Race Theory because CRT is a Marxist-Leninist tactic and must separate out and demonize a race to assign the oppressor role to. California Ed Code 51530 Title VI Possibly: 18 US Code Chapter 115 Lawyer Coalitions are standing with students and their families to protect their rights.
Thank you, Ann Chambers
