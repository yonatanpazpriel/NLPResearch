This is a divisive, inflammatory, partisan, racist curriculum draft that is harmful to all students by teaching material through a victims vs oppressors framework.
This is partisan ideology disguised as pedagogy.
A very sad comment on the systemic bias inculcated in our State Board of Education.
Best regards,
A concerned California parent.
