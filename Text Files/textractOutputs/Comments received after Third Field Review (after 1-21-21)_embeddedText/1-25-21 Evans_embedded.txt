Hello,
I am contacting you about the new information in your Jewish curriculum. As a Jew, this curriculum spreads false and harmful information about Jews. We have constantly been scrutinized and attacked for being Jewish. While there is not a specific holocaust going on at the moment, it is negligent to act as though there are decreases in anti-Semitism.
While some Jews do get "conditional whiteness", we are still victims of hate crimes. My Hillel was zoom-bombed during a Shabbat service by Neo-Nazis drawing swastikas on our screen this past year. Also, this curriculum completely disregards BIPOC Jews. Considering many Jews from Israel are people of color, this is ridiculous. Also, my ancestors could not receive "conditional whiteness" privilege when they were murdered in the holocaust.
In our society, we cannot be blind to the anti-Semitism which exists in our country. Especially when two weeks ago, Neo-Nazis helped to cause the insurrection at the Capital with shirts that said "Camp Auschwitz" and "6 Million was not enough" and/or Neo-Nazi tattoos and other paraphernalia.
For the sake of all Jews that your curriculum will serve, I ask that you please revisit your new curriculum and fix the information that it lists to describe Jews.
Thanks,
Gareth Evans
