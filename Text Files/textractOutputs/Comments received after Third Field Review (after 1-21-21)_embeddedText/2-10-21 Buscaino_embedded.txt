How exactly do you plan on having racial EQUALITY when you aren't including a Caucasian segment? This sounds like more "bash the white man" to me. Further dividing our nation through the minds of our children SHAME ON YOU! IM DISGUSTED AND I HAVE COMPLETELY LOST FAITH IN THE PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY LEADING US. SOCIOPATHS.
