From: Shari Ross Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 3:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies curriculum (AB 331)
My name is Shari Ross, and I am extremely concerned with CA Ethnic Studies curriculum (AB 331). The curriculum contains blatant misinformation about Jewish people that needs to be rectified. It is extremely harmful to us to continue to spread antisemitism in schools. Jewish people are disproportionately targeted in hate crimes in the US (we only make up 2% of the population, but are victims of 62% of religious hate crimes and 15% of ALL hate crimes). I hope you will take my comment into consideration, thank you.
