From: Ledesma, Berenice Sent: Sunday, February 7, 2021 11:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pro-Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom this may concern, I would like to send this email in favor of supporting the passing of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I believe every student has a right in knowing about all types of history, and not only the history of the colonizers. As a college student, I did not learn any of these Ethnic Studies until my college years, and I believe kids K-12 should learn about all this now and not until they reach college. Thank you, sincerely, Berenice.L.
