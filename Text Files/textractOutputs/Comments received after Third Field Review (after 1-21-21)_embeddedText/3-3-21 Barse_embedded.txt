From: BillBarse Sent: Tuesday, March 2, 2021 5:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Teaching or preaching? National Association of Scholars
As a retired university lecturer I can say our mission was to teach students how to think, not what to think. If teachers are teaching students what to think they are preaching, not teaching.
