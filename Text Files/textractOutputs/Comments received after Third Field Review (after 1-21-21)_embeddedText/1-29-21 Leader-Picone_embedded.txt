From: Malcolm Leader-Picone Sent: Friday, January 29, 2021 10:24 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
The proposed California Ethnic Studies curriculum is blatantly anti-Semitic and needs to be revised to recognize Jews as an oppressed minority in California and remove anti-Semitic tropes such as that Jews are "privileged".
