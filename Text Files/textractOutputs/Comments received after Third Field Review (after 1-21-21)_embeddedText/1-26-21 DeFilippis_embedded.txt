From: Michael DeFilippis [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 11:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish content in proposed Curriculum
Hello,
I hope this finds you well - I'm sending an email because of some things I've heard and seen about some potentially problematic material concerning the Jewish community in the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum for CA. I would like to say I fully support a mandated ethnic Studies Curriculum and think it's a fantastic idea, but I would just implore you to be certain that none of the material within could be antiSemitic or detrimental to the Jewish community. It has been hard to find clear sources, so my apologies if this has been addressed and fixed. Antisemitism is often overlooked and the Jewish community is frequently misjudged, and I feel it is important not to overlook this when designing a curriculum.
Wishing you all the best, Michael DeFilippis
