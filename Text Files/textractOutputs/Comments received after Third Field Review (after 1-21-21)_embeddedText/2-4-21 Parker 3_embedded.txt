One of the people on the committee who drew up the original ethnic studies curriculum is Angela Davis. I looked her up on Wikipedia and there is a biography of this famous person. She is a proud communist so of course it makes sense that she considers anyone even slightly less communist than she is to be "right wing." Please read her biography. It is very enlightening. She was fired from her teaching job at UCLA for teaching communism but rehired because a California judge said this was illegal. There used to be a law in California that teachers who were members of the Communist party were illegal. So far as I know this law is still on the books although not enforced. But it is important to understand that ethnic studies is a political movement intended to indoctrinate students with communist ideology.
