I don't know all of the particulars however from what I understand the only group of people referred to as having privilege are the Jews? If this is the case, the propaganda being put out from your organization is completely unbalanced, and harmful not only to the Jewish community, but to the students whose minds you are poisoning against Jews. If you can't see the harm that this is causing, then you don't belong in a position of feeding young minds. I hope that this issue will be deeply researched and remedied. One wonders if the goal of such ridiculous rhetoric is for another holocaust to occur, because that's what is going to happen if people don't stop demonizing Jews. If people don't start to look in the mirror and see the hate that they feel, and know that it is an ugly thing, then this world is doomed.
