From: jade818 Sent: Friday, January 29, 2021 1:55 PM To: IQC Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
IQC Representatives,
I write to join the numerous calls for continued improvement of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Antisemitism is a form of hate and anti-Zionism is antisemitic.
I have the following requests of the ESMC:
� Accurately represent Jewish American experiences and ensure that antisemitism with all its consequences are part of the curriculum.
� Ensure that negative language about Jews and Israel remains out of the curriculum (including but not limited to attempts via BDS to delegitimize Israel).
� Include sample lesson(s) reflecting the diversity and accomplishments of Jewish Americans as well as members among other ethnic groups.
� Re-commit to transparency and the pre-determined process of writing the ESMC. � Removing the indoctrinating Critical Ethnic Studies ideology from the Guiding Values
and Principles. � Replacing the narrow Critical ES language and leading questions that assume a
foregone conclusion, with broader constructive language that invites inquiry and analysis from multiple perspectives. � Removing content that promotes violence or victimhood, or demeans any ethnic group.
