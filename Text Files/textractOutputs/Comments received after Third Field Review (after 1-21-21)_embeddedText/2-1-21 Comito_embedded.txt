All--
I see that unfortunately the public comment period has ended but I'm hoping my opinions may still be considered.
As a life-long Progressive activist Democrat, I find this proposal shocking in it's misguided blatant antisemitism. BDS? Even the majority of the US Congress last year and President Biden have denounced this dangerous concept.
I can't even begin to address the just plain goofball gobbledygook language that is also included. The myriad newspaper editorial boards have been spot on. Please don't make our state the laughingstock of the country and give fuel to the efforts to recall our Governor.
Stop the insanity with this. I'm sorry I don't have a more literate professional response but this proposal doesn't really deserve it.
Thank you for your consideration of my comments.
Respectfully,
Charlotte Comito
