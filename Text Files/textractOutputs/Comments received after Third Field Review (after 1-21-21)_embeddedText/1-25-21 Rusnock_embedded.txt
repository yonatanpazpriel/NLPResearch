From: K ANDREA RUSNOCK Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 5:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Where to begin
To Whom It May Concern, I already have written about your misguided idea of Jews being an ethnic group. I add the following upon a closer reading of Sample Lesson 41. 1. In your "Iceberg" project under Sample Lesson 41 you tell students to add 3 visible and 3 invisible identities and under this you have "Ethnic Appearance." This is beyond the pale and is right out of the antisemitism playbook. And what will happen when a student draws someone with a hook nose, a lï¿½ old school antisemitism? 2. Further,
How do Jews not fit neatly into a religious category? Judaism, and therefore being a Jew, is a religious identity. While there are sects in Judaism (Reform, Conservative, Orthodox, etc.) they are all of one religion.
3. Additionally, you ask
This makes no sense in this section as being a Jew is not a racial identity.
4. Again,
It is not an ethnic group.
5. Even at the outset in this section you claim:
Jews are not a common ethnic peoplehood, Jews come from all over the world. Ashkenazic Jews and Sephardic Jews, two of the largest geographical Jewish groups, share one thing -- their religion. That is it. They have different languages, dress, food, and even some of the ritual celebrations (they give up different foods for Passover).

6. Moreover, you spend a good part of this section speaking of how Jews have "conditional whiteness" and benefit from "privilege" yet your two You Tube video clips only show African-American Jews. So, it seems to me, you undercut your argument, which indicates you know being Jewish is not an ethnicity or race.
I ask you to reconfigure this section as I fear you will end doing more harm than good, which I know is not your intent.
Sincerely,
Andrea Rusnock
