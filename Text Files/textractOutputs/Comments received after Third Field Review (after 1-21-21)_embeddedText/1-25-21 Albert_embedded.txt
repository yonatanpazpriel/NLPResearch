From: Louis Albert [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 10:08 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] AB331 please forward
Dear Governor Newsom,
This bill upholds a legacy of the same state-sanctioned antisemitism which uprooted millions of Jews throughout history, and will aid in creating an unsafe and antisemitic environment for Jewish students in California. I implore you to veto AB331.
Sincerely, Susan B Albert
