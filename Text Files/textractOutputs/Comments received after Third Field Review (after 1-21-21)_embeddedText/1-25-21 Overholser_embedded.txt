From: Tracy Overholser [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 4:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] On behalf of my Jewish friends
Dear Sir/Madam,
Your ethnic studies curriculum associates the word "privilege" with Jews with light colored skin. Indeed, of all the ethnic groups that you describe, Jews are the only group that you place the word "privilege" besides. Given that a large percent of American Jews are 1-2 generations from the death camps and zero to one generations from being forced to leave their homes due to hostility against them for being Jews, I feel that using the term "privilege" is highly inappropriate. It generates the same kind of hostility against Jews that led to the death camps and expulsion. I urge you to revise your curriculum to increase tolerance toward Jews and all people rather than decrease it.
Thank you!
PS: That was a form letter above that I totally agree with. I'm a native Californian, who moved out because of disgusting issues like this. Everybody flocked to CA in past decades, and now they're flocking elsewhere. CA has become trashed because the thoughts of most of the population there (or politicians) have materialized into physically what their thoughts promoted. If one thinks trash, one materializes the same. If so many think this way, then what does that say about the morality of most of CA's population? OR is it just poor quality politicians? Doesn't matter to me. If CA crumbles into the Pacific, then sadly it took that to improve the USA. Sincerely yours.
