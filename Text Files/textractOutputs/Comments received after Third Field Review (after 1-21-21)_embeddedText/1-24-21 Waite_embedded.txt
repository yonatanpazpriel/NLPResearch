To Whom It May Concern,
I'm writing to express my discontent with the proposed curriculum in California's ethnic studies regarding Jewish Peoples. The term "privilege" to describe Jewish People is a form of anti-semitism as it implies a false narrative that Jewish people aren't continually discriminated against, face hate crimes and other kinds of abuse, and that somehow they "all" have a certain about of privilege /power (ex. the age old trope all Jews are rich). To further prove how inappropriate this language is (ESPECIALLY in a textbook for children), is the fact David Duke uses the term "Jewish Privilege" to describe Jewish Peoples. This is dangerous language, and wrong. Do not approve this curriculum- as you will also be approving violence and anti-semitism.
