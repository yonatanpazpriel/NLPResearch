From: Leslie Perry Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 2:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment Regarding Ethnic Studies Porposal
Hello,
My name is Leslie Perry and I am a resident of Solano County. I recently heard about the new proposed ethnic studies curriculum specifically surrounding Jewish studies. There is anti-Semitic language in the proposed curriculum which conflates Jewish identity with privilege.
Jewish people in America still face anti-Semitism every day, and this needs to be acknowledged in ethnic studies in schools across the state. As with any race, ethnicity, culture, and religion, individuals in the Jewish community should be listened to regarding their experiences and identities. They should be the ones deciding how they are represented in California schools' curriculum.
Until this curriculum is revised with input from the Jewish community, I (and many others) call on this proposal to be vetoed.
Thank you for your time.
Best wishes, Leslie Perry
