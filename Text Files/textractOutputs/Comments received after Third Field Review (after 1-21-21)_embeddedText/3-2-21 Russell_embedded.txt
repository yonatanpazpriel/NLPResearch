From: Rabbi Russell Sent: Tuesday, March 2, 2021 11:20 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Center for Human Equality
As Executive Director of the Center for Human Equality based in Grants Pass, Oregon I am writing to encourage equality of respect for any ethnic studies program for students.
Our Center is opposed to the grouping and judging of any human beings because it is so harmful for human relations. Jews were grouped and judged as bad people which led to the Holocaust where six million men, women and children were systematically murdered. They were murdered only because of their membership in a collective group of human beings.
Human beings are not groups, they are unique individuals. If any educational system groups people and judges them based on skin color, ethnicity, religion, etc. they are harming human relations, not helping. We are responsible only for our own actions not the actions of others who may look like us. We should be judged individually, not collectively.
Please structure any studies you may teach to children, not based on any kind of grouping of victims and oppressors, but respect for every human being regardless of where they come from or what they look like. Equality is to treat each student with respect, not only certain groups.
Thank you and Shalom,
Rabbi Russell
