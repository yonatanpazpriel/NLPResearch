From: GAIL COOPER Sent: Thursday, February 11, 2021 10:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies; [emails redacted]; Tony Thurmond Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I read this article and was very disturbed. https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles /california-ethnic-studies-curriculum. But I was puzzled why the author pointed readers to the first - 2019 - draft, and not later ones. I believe that was disingenuous on her part and was glad I saw her footnote at the end - though not convinced by her argument. When I saw the last draft, some of my concern was allayed.
I definitely support the teaching of ethnic studies. But even recognizing how sensitive the field is, I do believe it is possible to teach ethnic studies without teaching perspectives as truth or fact that many disagree with. There is so much to teach/learn about the treatment of people of color in the U.S. certainly more than any curriculum could reasonably cover. Can't the focus just start there? There is enough we can agree on - do you/we really need to get into every conceivable issue such as colonialism and the BDS movement? I am certainly offended that the BDS perspective is accepted as the gospel and that antisemitism is minimized. I truly hope that the Commission/Board assures that school districts do not adopt the abandoned 2019 version.
