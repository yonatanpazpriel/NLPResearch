I was recently made aware of the ethnic studies program and it's lack of sensitivity to the Jewish ethnic minority. Jews like other ethnic minorities are under increasing attack and pressure from white supremacist groups in the US and around the world. It is true that currently Jews might not face some of the harsh effects of institutional racism that is a tragedy of the Black, Asian and Latinx communities, but nonetheless they are under frequent attack from fellow citizens and are often the subject of conspiracy theories. I hope that when considering the Ethnic Studies program in California that Jews will be understood as an ethnic minority that has consistently been under attack for the last 500 years in Europe and the United States. I truly hope that future generations of American kids can learn of the struggles of all ethnic minorities and sub groups and that empathy can be at the roof of their social interaction.
