I hate to have to be the one to say it but hey someone has to and the message is so so vital! and that is - all these perhaps well intentioned, let's call them radical social transformative agendas, be it feminism, civil rights Etc. are fundamentally not going to succeed in their own stated objective- for what the world needs more of is RESPECT- not the denigration of the person you feel is your enemy... - and if there is a group - which of-course rightfully so - is demanding respect, because of historical abuse or negative perceptions - the only way to get the people you want to perceive you in a good way... is first of all to be RESPECTFUL - second of all to respectfully, educate the people you are trying to change, on the importance of RESPECT
May You Be Granted G-d's Infinite Blessings,
