From: Adam Berger [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 9:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education,
I am writing because I do not support the proposed ethnic studies curriculum due to its dangerous Antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege.
Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity, and should be the ones deciding how they are represented in California's schools curriculum.
Until the curriculum is revised, to properly represent Jewish identity and history, the proposal needs to be vetoed.
Please see link below for a full explanation of why the proposed curriculum is problematic for Jews, and the suggested revisions https://www.standwithus.com/esmc-analysis-and-revisions
Thank you for doing the right thing, Adam
