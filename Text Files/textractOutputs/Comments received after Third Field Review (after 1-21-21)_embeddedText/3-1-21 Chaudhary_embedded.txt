From: Uzma Chaudhary Sent: Saturday, February 27, 2021 4:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Uzma Chaudhary Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum acceptance for Pakistani and Bangladesh studies
Respected Committee Members,
I would like to urge the committee to reconsider the Pakistan/Bangladesh studies curriculum application and include it for our student's school experience. This would be an invaluable service towards diversity and enhanced understanding for all cultural backgrounds.
