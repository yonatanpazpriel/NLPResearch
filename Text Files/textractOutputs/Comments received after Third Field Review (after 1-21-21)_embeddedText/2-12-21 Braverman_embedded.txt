From: cgbraver Sent: Friday, February 12, 2021 12:02 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] upcoming vote on ESCM
Dear Ethnic Studies Committee: I recently became aware of the third draft of the ESMC from friends, and through the local synagogue and other sources, have read portions of the (huge) document , and critical articles commenting on its provision. While I support Ethnic studies in principle, this is not the model. As a retired high school teacher, and a registered Democrat, and a grandmother of children in the public school system in California, I am writing to the parties concerned in the upcoming vote to express how disheartened I am at the prospect of this document becoming part of the school curriculum; instead of building bridges and mutual understanding and respect among children of varying backgrounds and cultures, instead of helping them to make their own decisions through knowledge, evidence and critical thinking, it is driven by a narrow political ideology, activism, and inculcation passing as education and the broadening of a child's horizons. It feels like a small group of dedicated and passionate activists intent on pushing their ideology on every child, mainly because most parents are so busy working and raising families to even know what is happening. Please veto this version of the ESMC .
Sincerely, Carole Braverman El Dorado Hills, Ca.
