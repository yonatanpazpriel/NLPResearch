As an educator, a Middle School Guidance Counselor, and an American Jew, I am shocked at what I have read regarding the content of California's proposed Ethnic Curriculum. I have attended diversity training classes in my capacity as a guidance counselor and have taught a tolerance curriculum. I am shocked at the lack of tolerance you show towards Jews and towards known Black leaders whose lives embraced the very concepts your curriculum lacks. It appears that in your efforts to embrace an updated look at the issue of diversity, you have thrown out the "proverbial baby with the bath water." The biases of the curriculum creators comes through loud and clear; is it truly your desire to pass judgements and promote your own agenda? How healthy is that? Is that how tolerance and unity is achieved? I STRONGLY urge you to assemble a new team to rewrite the curriculum to reflect the true mosaic of America and the world. I cannot imagine how this curriculum, in these days rife with conspiracy theories, Q-anon, etc , will enable California students to meet the challenges of seeking out truth, justice, tolerance, and kindness.
