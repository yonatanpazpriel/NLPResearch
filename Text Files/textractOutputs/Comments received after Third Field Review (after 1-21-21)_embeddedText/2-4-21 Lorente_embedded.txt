From: [email redacted] Sent: Thursday, February 4, 2021 2:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Pride in our California Hispanic heritage
To whom it may concern: Please don't omit or change the California Hispanic Heritage. I have always been proud of our beautiful Missions built by the Spanish Missionaries with the help of our Indians. Almost all Hispanics have some Mexican, or American Indian heritage. We are proud of our ethnic heritage. Columbus and all the other men that came from Spain to establish a new frontier were brave to cross our oceans. As you know our Catholic faith is very important to most Hispanics; so it was natural to want to share it with the Indians. Father Serra was a good priest, he loved the Indians. Some soldiers were not so good, and that is very unfortunate for us. Please do not allow Antifa and BLM to destroy and knock down our statues nor burn any of our Missions. Whether they are historical, religious statues or a Mission, they are important to our heritage! Please allow them to remain. I and my family have been to many of the Missions and seen many of the historical statues; please do not allow them to be destroyed by any angry group of people or organizations. They are very special to us. Thank you. Mrs. Lorente
