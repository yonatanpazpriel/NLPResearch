To whom it should concern:
As a California parent of school-age children, I was deeply disturbed by reports of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I understand that certain opponents of meaningful change will cherry-pick facts to underscore their opposition. But if any of the complaints are based in truth - MLK being painted out, genocidal Pol Pot being celebrated, Jews being characterized as cunning or shifty - this curriculum is not only offensive but dangerous. And of course entirely self-defeating as the enemies of equality and tolerance will use curricula like this to mis-characterize the worthy goals of the movement toward a more just society.
