To whom it may concern,
As A Jewish American I am appalled by the current antisemetic material that would be taught in the updated ethnic studies curriculum. It was shocking to read that the only group referred to as "priveledged" was the Jewish people and how the curriculum out Jews of color against white passing Jews. I am also saddened by the complete lack of mentioning the ethnic cleansing of 850,000 faced by Jews in the MENA, and the glorification of antisemetic figureheads. I want all students to have an understanding of racial dynamics and attitudes but presenting Jews and supremely privileged is out of a Nazi genocidal terminology abs as part of a community that is targeted with 57% of all religious based crimes and 15% of all hate crimes (despite making up less that 2% of the population) I am worried for our future. Please listen to the passionate Jewish leaders such as those at JIMENA who are expressing their real concern at the proposed curriculum. Best, Abraham
