From: ilana MILLER [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 11:12 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New Ethnic studies curriculum
Dear Sir/Madam, Your ethnic studies curriculum associates the word "privilege" with Jews with light colored skin. Indeed, of all the ethnic groups that you describe, Jews are the only group that you place the word "privilege" besides. Given that a large percent of American Jews are 1-2 generations from the death camps and zero to one generations from being forced to leave their homes due to hostility against them for being Jews, I feel that using the term "privilege" is highly inappropriate. It generates the same kind of hostility against Jews that led to the death camps and expulsion. I urge you to revise your curriculum to increase tolerance toward Jews and all people rather than decrease it. Thank you! Ilana D. Miller
