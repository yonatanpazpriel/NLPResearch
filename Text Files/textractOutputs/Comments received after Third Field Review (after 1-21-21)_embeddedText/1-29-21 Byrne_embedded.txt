From: Laura Byrne Sent: Friday, January 29, 2021 2:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Arab American Studies Coalition
The Save Arab-American Studies Coalition demands that the CDE re-empowers experts in the field of ethnic studies to decide on revisions to the ESMC that aligns with the principles, values, and pedagogy of ethnic studies. The coalition also demands that Arab-American studies-including Palestine-is put back where it belongs, within the Asian American and Pacific Islander section of the ESMC. Lastly, the coalition demands that an ESMC is approved that is anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory-that centers the voices and experiences of communities of color and the social justice movements.
Sincerely, Laura Byrne
