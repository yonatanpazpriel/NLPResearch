Introduction
From entrepreneurs and innovators to politicians and entertainers, Arab Americans have formed an integral part of American society for centuries. Despite this, American media, government, and education often put forth biased and inaccurate stereotypes of Arab Americans. This lesson asks students to critically interrogate these biased stereotypes and to listen to the authentic voices of Arab Americans.
With an estimated 3.5 million people who trace their ancestry to 22 different Arab countries, Arab Americans are one of the most diverse ethnic groups in the United States with many different lived experiences, customs, and beliefs.1 This lesson introduces

students to the diversity of experiences of Arab Americans, with a focus on humanizing members of this population to combat the monolithic stereotypes that students often encounter elsewhere.
Part One of this lesson features an overview of the Arab region, the history of Arab immigration to the United States, and current Arab American demographics. Part Two introduces students to the origins of dominant narratives about Arab Americans and the impact of these stereotypes. Finally, Part Three highlights the voices and contributions of Arab Americans and invites students to explore strategies for combating bias.
Because this lesson covers a large amount of content, educators should consider spreading the lesson across several class periods to allow sufficient time for class discussion and reflection.

Background Information for Educators
While the term "Arab" used to only refer to those whose native language is Arabic, the definition of Arab has broadened as more Arab Americans consider English as their first language. Today, Arabs are primarily defined as individuals who trace their ancestry to one or more of the 22 Arab countries (see map below). While these 22 countries have majority Arab populations, they are also incredibly diverse and include other ethnic groups, such as Kurds, Imazighen, and Persians.
The first wave of Arab immigration to the United States began in 1880 as significant Christian populations from modern-day Syria and Lebanon came to the United States to pursue new economic opportunities and to flee war in their homelands.2 From 1880-1920, more than 95,000 Arabs moved to the United States and began lives as merchants or small business owners. The second wave of Arab immigration occurred after World War II and included mostly urban, highly educated Christians and Muslims. The third wave of Arab immigration began in the 1970s when the United States lifted many of its restrictive immigration laws.3 Since 2000, many Arab immigrants and refugees, particularly from Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian Territories, Egypt and Somalia, have come to the United States to escape political instability and/or to seek new economic and educational opportunities.4

Today's Arab American population is one of the most diverse and fastest growing diasporic groups in the United States. Although the majority of Arabs worldwide are Muslim, the majority of Arab Americans are Christian.5 Almost 95% of Arab Americans live in urban areas, with California, Michigan, and New York having the highest Arab American populations.6 The average income of Arab Americans is 22% higher than the national average, and over 40% percent of Arab Americans have obtained at least a college degree compared to the national average of 34%.7
Despite the diversity and long history of Arab Americans in the United States, American media, governmental institutions, and educational sources often put forth harmful and inaccurate stereotypes of Arab men as violent and un-American, and Arab women as oppressed and submissive.8 For example, researcher Jack Shaheen studied over 900 American films and found that 95% of the films presented Arabs as "heartless, brutal, [or] uncivilized."9
These negative and inaccurate stereotypes stem from the colonial era and are referred to by scholars as "Orientalist ideas." Professor Edward Said, a pioneer in the field of Middle Eastern and Arab American studies, coined the term "Orientalism" to describe the pervasive Western (European and American) tradition of prejudiced interpretations of the East (particularly the Middle East), shaped by the attitudes of European imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries.10 Said argued that colonial figures defined the Arab world in opposition to the West and characterized its people as barbaric and uncivilized to justify the colonization and subjugation of Arab populations.11 Said and others argue that this legacy has persisted through the present day because it allows Western countries to assert themselves as superior to the Arab countries over whom they seek to exert power.12

These negative stereotypes have a tangible impact on Arab Americans every day.13 Hate crimes against Arab Americans and those perceived to be Arab or Muslim rose by 1700% in 2001.14 Arab American youth in particular have reported feeling "afraid, unsafe, and insecure" at school because of prejudiced rhetoric and actions by their peers and school officials.15 It is also important to note that not only Arabs are impacted by anti-Arab bias. Often members of other ethnic minority groups from the Middle East and other Asian regions, including Kurds, Imazighen, Persians, Sikhs, and South Asians, are targeted because they are mistakenly perceived to be Arab.
Despite these challenges, Arab Americans have continued to persist and succeed in their careers, education, and daily lives. Arab Americans are central figures in fields as diverse as science, technology, politics, and entertainment. Many organizations have dedicated their attention to improving the lives of Arab Americans through educational efforts and social justice campaigns. By elevating the voices and lived experiences of Arab Americans, educators can combat the widespread stereotypes and contribute to the humanization and appreciation of our fellow Americans.

In-Class Activities
1. Pre-Class Homework - Background Information In preparation for the first class, provide each student with a copy of the Know, Wonder, Learn (KWL) Worksheet. Under the "Something I Know" column, ask students to write down 2-3 bullet points on facts they know about Arab Americans. Under the "Something I Wonder" column, ask students to write down questions they have about Arab Americans or ideas they want to explore in class. Students will revisit the KWL worksheet at the end of the lesson.
Next, assign the Introduction and Chapter 1 (pages 1-15) of the short book Arab Americans: History, Culture, and Contributions for homework to be completed before the first class period dedicated to this lesson. The book provides an overview of the history and demographic background of Arab Americans. The book is available for free download through the Arab American National Museum's website (see hyperlink above).
2. Main Activity Part 1 - Arab American Identity and History Pass out the student version of the worksheet "True or False: Facts about Arab Americans." As a class, read out each of the statements and ask students to write
7

down whether they think each statement is true or false. After students have written down their answers, read off the correct answers from the teacher version of the worksheet.
Next, pass out a copy of the article "Arab American Stories: History" and the corresponding worksheet Arab Immigration Timeline. Divide the class into groups of 3-4 students and ask students to read the article together, which discusses the history of Arab immigration to the United States. As they read, students should take notes on the worksheet.
If time permits, ask students to read an interview with Mary Juma, an Arab American who immigrated to North Dakota from Syria in the 19th century. The interview focuses on her experience in the United States and humanizes the immigration process.
3. Discussion Part 1 Use the Part 1 Discussion Questions to guide students through a 10-15 minute class discussion about what they learned from the podcast and article.
4. Main Activity Part 2 - The History and Impact of Stereotypes Show the following clips (00:00-03:06 and 47:23-48:23) of the documentary Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People, which discusses Hollywood's long history of portraying negative stereotypes about Arabs. Distribute a copy of the Cornell Notes worksheet and ask students to take notes as they watch. Note: We do not recommend showing other clips of the film due to images of violence and nudity. The suggested clips (00:00-03:06 and 47:23-48:23) have been carefully selected to feature the central arguments of Dr. Jack Shaheen and to avoid inappropriate scenes.
Once students have had the opportunity to identify and reflect upon dominant stereotypes about Arabs in Hollywood, show the short video about Orientalism, which explains the origins of these biased depictions of Arabs. Provide the "What is Orientalism?" Worksheet and ask students to take notes as they watch. We recommend pausing the video at one minute intervals to give students time to ask clarifying questions and take notes since the material is dense. You may want to ask a student to volunteer to summarize each one minute interval to ensure students have grasped the main arguments.
5. Discussion Part 2 Divide the class into groups of 4-5 students and ask each group to discuss the following questions:
8

1. Where do stereotypes about Arabs come from? 2. What is Orientalism? 3. How do negative stereotypes impact Arab Americans?
Next, bring the class back together and use the Part 2 Discussion Questions to guide students through a 15-20 minute reflective discussion.
6. Main Activity Part 3 - Highlighting the Voices of Arab Americans Choose 1-2 episodes from Arab American Stories to show to the class. These episodes feature diverse Arab American individuals discussing their own experiences, successes, and challenges. We recommend the following episodes:  Episode 2: Bridge Builders  Episode 10: Civic Leaders  Episode 13: A New Generation
7. Discussion Part 3 Use this discussion to ask students to collectively brainstorm strategies to combat bias and discrimination against Arab Americans. Use the Part 3 Discussion Questions to guide the conversation.
8. Reflection Dedicate the last 10-15 of class to leading a reflective discussion about the main takeaways from the lesson and any questions students may still have. Revisit the KWL worksheet that students completed at the beginning of the lesson and ask students to spend five minutes to write 4-5 facts they learned under the "Something I Learned" column.
9. Extension Activities - Consider these ideas for further student exploration:  Ask students to independently research Arab American advocacy organizations in their communities. For community engagement activities, consider encouraging students to reach out to these organizations to interview them about their efforts, inquire about volunteer opportunities, or write about the achievements of these groups.  Ask students to conduct research on the issue of Arab American representation on the U.S. Census.

2. All Arab Americans speak Arabic. FALSE. While many Arab Americans speak Arabic as their first language, some Arab American families have lived in the United States for generations and in many cases, don't speak Arabic.
3. Arab Americans are integral parts of US culture, economics, and politics. TRUE. For generations, Arab Americans have made strides in all facets of American society. Famous Arab Americans include Salma Hayek (actress), Ramy Youssef (actor), Steve Jobs (co-founder of Apple), Khalil Gibran (writer and poet), Ilhan Omar (U.S. Congresswoman), and Robert Saleh (head coach of the NY Jets).
4. California has the largest population of Arab Americans. TRUE. California is home to an estimated 400,000 Arab Americans. Other states with large Arab American populations include Michigan, New York, Illinois, and Texas.
5. Arab Americans have a higher average income than the national average. TRUE. The average income of Arab Americans is 22% higher than the national average.
6. `Arab American' is an official minority group listed on the U.S. Census. FALSE. The U.S. Census does not yet recognize Arab Americans as an official minority group in the United States.

15

8. All Arab American women wear hijabs (head scarves). FALSE. Although some Arab Muslim American women choose to wear the hijab as part of their faith, many women do not. The decision to wear a scarf is made on an individual or family basis.
9. Arab American food includes dishes like mansaf, hummus, and tabouleh. TRUE. Arab American food is rich with spices and savory flavors. Arab Americans who trace their roots to different parts of the Arab region share different types of food.
