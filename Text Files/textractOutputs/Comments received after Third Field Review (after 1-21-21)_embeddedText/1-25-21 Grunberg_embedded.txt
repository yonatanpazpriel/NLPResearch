From: On This Day In Jewish History Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 11:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Utter Shock & Disgust. Do Better.
To whom this may concern,
How is it possible that in 2021, the State of California is about to pass a school curriculum that mirrors the language to describe Jewish identity that the Nazis used in the 1930s?
Can you please explain to me which (if any) Jewish educators and leaders were involved in the making of this curriculum? Or did you ignore the majority of Jewish voices to push through a hateful piece of "education" that tells Jews how to identify?
Are you aware of the implication that this curriculum will have on Jews not just in California but all over the country - a country that for the last two years has seen the highest rate of hate-crimes committed against Jews?
But none of this matters right? For the sake of "intersectionality" and "justice" - Jews are "too privileged" to have a voice in the struggle for intersectionality right? You are clueless about our experiences and it shows.
Where is the privilege when Jewish students will be bullied by this trash you're indoctrinating students in California with?
You should be ashamed of yourselves - take a hard look in the mirror and learn from your mistakes. We hope to God that you make the right decision and re-evaluate this "curriculum" to include Jewish voices (not token Jewish voices, but the majority of Jewish voices) and let Jews teach the world how Jews identify.
