Last year, 35 scholars (not high school teachers) determined the "research" used to support claims of the benefits of ethnic studies courses in the Introduction and Overview to the Third Field Review of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) are baseless. Worse, these same scholars point out errors that must come from ignorance or incompetence because the only other reason is antisemitism. Wiping out Jews from history is something most citizens of this state should not take lightly. It is time to take those involved in the antisemitic BDS movement off the ESMC curriculum committee and form a new one with competent and unbiased scholars.
