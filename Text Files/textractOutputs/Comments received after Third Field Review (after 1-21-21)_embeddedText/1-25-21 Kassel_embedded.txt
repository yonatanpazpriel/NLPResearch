From: Ben Kassel [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 10:02 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New Ethnic Studies Education
To whom you may concern,
I am a Jewish college student who's a California resident. I am emailing you in regards to your new Ethnic Studies curriculum in schools in California. I think it's great how you are promoting equality for all with this curriculum as well as diversity and rights for minorities. However, it has come to my attention out of significant amounts of frustration that you are not including the Jewish population that are white in this education, especially during Holocaust remembrance week for that matter. I have had relatives who you would apparently consider "racial privileges" or "white privilege" who have died in the Holocaust as well as a grandmother who survived it. I find not including white Jews in this curriculum just because of their skin color to be both racist and anti-semetic. In addition, I find advocating for equality for all and then not including the entire Jewish population in this to be highly hypocritical. I hope that instead of just ignoring my email and not caring about it that you seriously take it into consideration. Thank you and have a fantastic day!
