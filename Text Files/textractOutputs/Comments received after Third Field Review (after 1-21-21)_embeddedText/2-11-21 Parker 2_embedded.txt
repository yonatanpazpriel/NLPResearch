Dear Ms. Rosenson,
My name is Katrin Stoll, I am a Holocaust scholar based in Warsaw and Jena specializing in the criminal prosecution of Nazi crimes in Germany, Holocaust historiography and testimony as well as Jewish survivor scholars and their work. I also do translation work from Polish into English.
On behalf of Ruth Parker, Aron Bejlin's niece, I am writing to enquire about the possibility of publishing her uncle's Holocaust testimonies.
Aron Bejlin, a physician who headed the hospital for infectious diseases in Bialystok, was deported by the Germans from the Bialystok ghetto to Auschwitz in February 1943. At Auschwitz, he had to work in the so-called Gypsy Family Camp under Joseph Mengele. Bejlin survived one of the notorious death marches. He emigrated to Israel after the war.
Bejlin testified as a witness in the Eichmann Trial (1961), the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial (19631965) and the Bielefeld Bialystok Trial (1965-1967). I transcribed parts of his audio testimony � in the trials held in Frankfurt and Bielefeld he testified in Germanin the courtroom � for my PhD thesis on the so-called Bielefeld Bialystok Trial entitled Die Herstellung der Wahrheit (The Production of Truth, see pp. 567 onwards).

Bejlin's Frankfurt Auschwitz Trial testimony has been made available online by the Fritz Bauer Institut in Frankfurt: https://www.auschwitz-prozess.de/ (see also the pdf file in the attachment).
Last year, I received Aron Bejlin's Yad Vashem testimony, which is in Polish (I will send it you in a separate email). I strongly believe it necessary to make all of Aron Bejlin's testimonies available to researchers in an edited volume, possibly including both the testimonies in the original language as well as an English translation. I would be happy to write a short introduction to such a volume.
As far as the publication of the testimonies is concerned, we would need the green light from the Fritz Bauer Institut, Yad Vashem Archives and the Landesarchiv NRW Abteilung Ostwestfalen (the Bielefeld Bialystok trial records including the audio testimonies of the main hearing are stored there).
Would the USHMM be interested in editing Aron's testimonies? If so, could you think of a translator from Polish into English as well as a translator from German into English who would be willing to work on such a project?
Aron Bejlin had an extraordinary memory and he was able to narrate his experience in a very plastic way. He also testified in the name of those who could not testify anymore. On this issue see my paper in the attachment. It is based on a talk that I gave many years ago at a Holocaust conference in Akko. It has not been published so far.
There is a great interest in Bejlin's testimony. One of my students at Friedrich-SchillerUniversit�t Jena wrote a term paper on the subject of death marches. She used parts of his Bialystok trial testimony as a source.
I look forward to hearing from you.
Yours sincerely Katrin Stoll
