Dear Honorable Members of the CDE, I write to you today in support of Armenian-American Studies in the ESMC. Our community today is under attack and historically marginalized within the United States. Please do not marginalize our histories in the curriculum. Armenian-Americans make up over 1 million people in the United States, with the largest community residing in California. Armenian-Americans have a long history of experiences of marginalization, migration, racialization, refugeehood, surveillance, and lack of equitable access to education, health and employment in the United States. Many Armenian-American students are immigrants and refugees, or their children, and English Language Learners. They continue to be impacted by curriculum that marginalizes their histories and needs. We urge the IQC and the CDE to center Ethnic Studies Scholars and practitioners in the writing of the model curriculum. As a concerned community member I am calling on you to bring Armenian-American Studies scholars who do Ethnic Studies to the table and incorporate Armenian-American Studies in the main curriculum.

Thank you, Milena Grigoryan
