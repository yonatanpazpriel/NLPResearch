To whom it may concern,
I have been a resident of this state for 30 years. I had always planned to raise my two small boys here. However, if this new ethnic studies curriculum goes into effect, my husband and I are moving. We are a proud Jewish family with Israeli roots and stem from Holocaust survivors. I simply will not live somewhere we are not welcome.
I sincerely hope this does not become a reality, Jesse Shaked
