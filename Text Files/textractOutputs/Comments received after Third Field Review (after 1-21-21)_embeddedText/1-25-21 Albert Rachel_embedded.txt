From: Rachel Albert [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 9:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Veto Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Please veto the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum. It contains inaccurate information that is harmful to the Jewish people and erases the identity of many Jews.
Thank you,
