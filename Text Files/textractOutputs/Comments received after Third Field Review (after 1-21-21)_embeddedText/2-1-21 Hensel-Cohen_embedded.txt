From: Sharon hensel-cohen Sent: Monday, February 1, 2021 12:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] unacceptable inappropriate behavior and curriculum on the part of board of education guidelines
on the ethnic stufies curriculum regarding Jews, the omission of Anti-Semitism, condeming Israel and denigrating Jews in general and overall. It should be understood that California has a high percentage of involved and concerned prominent citizens with children attending the public school system. This attitude and written curricular form is abominable and hateful to Jews.... This is a time for all of us, regardless of race, religion etc, to come together and move forward. The California Department of Education is encouraging division, hatefulness and in my opinion is doing a great wrong. Our community will support dissolution of this limited and inappropriate portion of this ethnic studies curriculum which in itself supports division and separation. I am sad to see this, to understand the short-sightedness of educators who developed this and believe that more repercussions might come of this to all of us.....
