The entire concept of the "model curriculum" is irredeemably flawed. Attempting to divide the world between male heterosexuals of European ancestry and everyone else is not a recipe for social harmony, but rather for fueling racism and other forms of identity-politics bigotry on both sides. The people pushing this need to think about the violence and suffering they are going to cause, and stop.
