Dear Ethnic Studies Curriculum Board,
As I am sure that you have already heard, your curriculum is biased against Jews, and puts Jews in danger. You refer to Jews as � privileged � in your document. They are the only ethnic group that you refer to as such. The nazis also referred to Jews as � privileged � and decided to commit a genocide because of this. Your curriculum will incite violence against Jews, period. Once you adopt this curriculum, it will spread across the country and then internationally. Hatred against Jews is based on calling them privileged, and then killing them. This is different from other forms of racial, religious, or ethnic hatred, where the targeted group are referred to as inferior. By putting this curriculum into play, you are signing a death warrant for Jews globally, they will never be safe after you enlarge the target that is already on their backs. Please reconsider your motives, and the content of your curriculum.
