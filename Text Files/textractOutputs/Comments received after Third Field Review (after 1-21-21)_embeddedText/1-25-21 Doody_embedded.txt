To Whom it May Concern, The proposed California ethnic studies curriculum is a disgrace and normalizes antisemitism. It has dangerous antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege. For reference, KKK leader David Duke uses the term "Jewish Privilege". Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity and should be the ones to represent how they are represented in California's school curriculum. This proposal must be vetoed until there is input from the Jewish community in how Jewish identity and history are represented. Remember that antisemitic imagery was used by the rioters at the US Capitol on January 6. There is no inherent privilege connected to having a Jewish identity.
