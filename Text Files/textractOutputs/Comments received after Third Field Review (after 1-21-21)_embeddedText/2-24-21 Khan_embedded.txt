Subject: Add Pakistani and Bangladeshi curriculum in Ethnic Studies
Dear State Board of Education of California,
My name is saima khan. I am a resident of orange,CA. I am asking you to expand the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by including the sample lessons about the Pakistani and Bangladeshi American communities.
An Ethnic Studies curriculum should provide as many resources as possible, so that school districts and classroom teachers can select the best options for their student populations. Reflecting the cultural diversity within the Asian and South Asian communities provides a richer experience for all students.
The experiences of Pakistani and Bangladeshi Americans are also deeply tied to their identities as Muslim Americans. Given the increase in Islamophobia and the prevalence of misconceptions about Muslims, these voices must be included in conversations about justice and equality.
Thank you for your consideration.
Sincerely, Saima khan
