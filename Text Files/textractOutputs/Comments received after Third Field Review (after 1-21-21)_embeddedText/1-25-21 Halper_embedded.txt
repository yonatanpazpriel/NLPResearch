From: dylan halper [email redacted] Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 7:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education,
I am writing because I do not support the proposed ethnic studies curriculum due to its dangerous antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege. As a Jew, I'm very concerned by this language as the term "Jewish Privilege" is used by David Duke, the former leader of the KKK and avid racist and antisemite. While it may seem like a progressive curriculum, this demonstrates its using FarRight KKK rhetoric in its syllabus.
Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity, and should be the ones deciding how they are represented in California's schools curriculum.
Until the curriculum is revised, to properly represent Jewish identity and history, the proposal should not move forward.
Please see link below for a full explanation of why the proposed curriculum is problematic for Jews, and the suggested revisions https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__www.standwithus.com_esmc-2Danalysis-2Dand-2Drevisions&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLSQ8giiFlA-AKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=nwcK4q0hYpQEIrli65lQg_d5erE4Fve3NsewCbmen wo&s=aGqKT5LxbKkcR4xbJ1r1j9jOlnryWwHxlpQDVnlpwbM&e=
