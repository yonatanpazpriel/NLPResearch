To whom this may concern,
My name is Kate Padgett and I reside in Merrick, NY. I am writing to you today because it has been brought to my attention that Jews are the only ethnic group defined as having "privilege" in the state of California's this is extremely undermining of the Anti-semitism that the Jewish community faces EVERY SINGLE DAY.
I do not support this proposal due to it's dangerous antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege. (Note that the term "Jewish privilege" was coined by KKK leader David Duke.) Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity and decide how they are represented in California's school curriculum. I demand that the proposal is vetoed until the curriculum is revised with input from the Jewish community.
Thank you for your time.
