Re: Reconsider Your Support for the ESMC in California
Dear ESMC Advisory Committee Members,
I am writing because you are key members of a committee that has been directly involved in formulating and promoting the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) (https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/ethnicguidelines.asp). The ESMC will be an unjustified and racially divisive burden on K-12 students in California public schools. This burden will further damage the already poor quality of public education in California. In particular, it will harm Black students, who are suffering the most from this poor quality education. Extensive evidence regarding Black students is given in the three sources cited below.
Although the ESMC is scheduled to be adopted in California this year, it is facing tremendous opposition. If adopted, it will be immediately challenged: "Legal coalition forming to stop critical race theory training around the country: The coalition hopes to bring a case before the Supreme Court" (https://www.foxnews.com/politics/legal-coalition-critical-race-theory). The ESMC will further undermine parental and taxpayer support for public education in California and will increase the demand for School Choice by organizations like the Parent Union (https://parentunion.org/). Please keep in mind that Propositions 15 and 16 were both rejected by California voters on November 3, 2020.
In summary, I strongly recommend that you reconsider your support for the ESMC in California.

Thank you very much for your consideration.
Sincerely yours,
