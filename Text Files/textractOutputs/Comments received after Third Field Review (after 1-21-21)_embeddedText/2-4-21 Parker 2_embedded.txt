Federal Contested Election Act. Who knew? I just finished reading the lead article in the J entitled "Latest Salvo in Ethnic Studies Curriculum" which you can find by Googling the title. It details how the authors of the original draft which was rejected by Governor Newsom want their names removed from the redacted curriculum because it does not fit with their far left politics which assumes that Palestinians and Arabs are ethnically victimized but Jews and Armenians are not. They say that their curriculum was attacked by a right wing conspiracy which should come as a surprise to the more than 70% of American Jews who identify as Democrats generally seen as on the left. So you can't belong in ethnic studies if you dispute their definition of ethnically marginalized and/or persecuted. And Blacks who are Conservatives are uncle Toms who also don't belong. If this logic makes sense to you please explain it to me.

Ruth, The 2020 election will go down as one of the most corrupt elections for any democracy. The sheer number of "irregularities" that were ignored by the press and state officials is shocking. I know, because my race against progressive stalwart Julia Brownley, here in California, was one of those irregularities. Nancy Pelosi and the California Democrat Machine intentionally circumvented the will of the voters here because they can't have people who look like me opposing their liberal policies.

I'm a proud Black Republican Woman � I am the Democrat Party's worst nightmare, and they did all they could to keep me from winning. My name is Ronda Kennedy. I am an attorney, law school dean, mother of six children, a proud Black Republican, and a candidate for Congress against a radical leftist. I am taking this fight to Congress to formally contest the election results and I need your help. There are too many unanswered questions about the results of my race, and I intend to fight until only the legal votes are counted. I wasn't supposed to fight the results � I was supposed to take my loss and go back home with my family. We all saw what they did to President Trump when he dared to ask questions, and they are trying to do the same to me. They KNEW they couldn't beat me on the issues, and they KNEW that the voters in my district had enough of Julia Brownley, and they KNEW I was going to win so they decided I had to lose.
They are terrified of a black woman talking about our conservative values, and the last thing they wanted me to do was formally contest the election in the House of Representatives under the Federal Contested Election Act. I will now be able to subpoena witnesses and demand evidence that I couldn't get from the Elections Board who was helping the Democrats scheme against another Republican candidate. So, that is just what I did and why I need your help to prove my case. Will you help my campaign with an immediate donation of $35, $50, $100, or $250, so I will have the resources necessary to fight for the integrity of our election system in the coming fight? California Democrats have created a machine to disenfranchise voters and prevent Republicans from winning fairly, so I'm taking a stand for every California voter. This fight is about more than this race, it is about the future of our state, our Party and our nation. If we sit back and allow these Democrats to undermine

the very foundation of our Republic, they will not stop until they control every aspect of your life from the cradle to the grave. If you agree, you need to stand with me as I fight for all of us. [donation link redacted] Please stay safe,
