AMP (American Muslims for Palestine) has a four pronged approach aimed at how to turn US students against Israel. The Ethnic Studies Program has, at one time, the BOYCOTT Movement which is aimed at destroying Israel.
I am concerned that those who want the destruction of Israel are using US minorities and trying to get into out schools. Please be aware of what AMP is doing and what their intentions are.,
