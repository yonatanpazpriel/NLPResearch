From: Emma Burkey [email redacted] Sent: Monday, January 25, 2021 12:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Antisemitic Information
Hello,
I am emailing to ask that the CDE halt the currently Antisemitic curriculum that is being pushed in California schools. The information is not only false, but also Antisemitic and MUST be reevaluated before it is given to children.
Thank you.
