To Whom It May Concern-
In reading about the Tablet Magazine's story about the proposed ESMC program, which my sons will be taking at some point in their California public education career, I am now extremely concerned about what seems to be a clear anti-Semitic bent of said program, and, in addition, the marginalization of other important cultures.
Is this the case? Does the article lay out the program accurately, particularly its depiction of the Holocaust and American Jewry? What is your response to the article and how will your program and department move to make necessary changes?
I am looking forward to your response, and course correction if necessary. I am available for further discussion.
Thanks, Aaron Spiewak Manhattan Beach, CA
