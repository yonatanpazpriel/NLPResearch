What is extremely frustrating to me is that the media claims that Antifa/BLM "mostly peaceful" insurgency riots were not limited to "last summer" but have continued to this day in cities across the country including DC and when they yell "burn it down" they mean it because they have done just that. And they have injured and killed more people, including police officers, and destroyed more government property (not to mention private property) than were killed and destroyed in the January 6th "insurgency." The coverage is incredibly biased. Will Trump's lawyers make this point at the impeachment hearing? I hope so. The American people have a right to know the facts. ----- Forwarded Message ----From: The Epoch Times To: rsparker27 Sent: Monday, February 8, 2021, 01:59:40 AM PST Subject: Media's Obsession With Jan. 6 `Extremely Frustrating' to Law Enforcement: Retired Sergeant FEBRUARY 8, 2021READ IN BROWSER
