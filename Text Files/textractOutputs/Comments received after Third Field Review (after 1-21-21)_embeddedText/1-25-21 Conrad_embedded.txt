From: Tyler Conrad [email redacted] Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 11:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish Privilege
To whom it may concern,
Given that the Capitol was just attacked by white supremacists who openly believe that the Trump administration was secretly fighting an international Jewish group, now isn't a great time to be misrepresenting marginalized groups against their wishes.
Sincerely, Tyler
