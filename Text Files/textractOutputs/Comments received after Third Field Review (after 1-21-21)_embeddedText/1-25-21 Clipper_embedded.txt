Dear California Department of Education,
I am writing as a Jewish teacher who does not support the proposed ethnic studies curriculum due to its dangerous antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege.
Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity, and should be the ones deciding how they are represented in California's schools curriculum.
Until the curriculum is revised, with input and approval from the Jewish community in how Jewish identity and history are represented, the proposal needs to be vetoed.
Please see link below for a full explanation of why the currently proposed curriculum is problematic for Jews, and the suggested revisions https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__www.standwithus.com_esmc-2Danalysis-2Dand2Drevisions&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaATxl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=gqG9KfmNzgAnV N4hCSYizl04WBESu_KH77lMRFjc5sI&s=CHxQFIcOwpU9HLyQZGcGR3i NXRZ_ra-ScYRD7LOcuDY&e=
