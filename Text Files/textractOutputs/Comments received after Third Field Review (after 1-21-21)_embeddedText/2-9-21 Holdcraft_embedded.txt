California schools have many failing schools and students that do not graduate from high school.
Therefore, high schools should first train students in basic of math and reading and writing rather than ethnic studies about oppressors and the oppressed.
Second, high schools should teach students job skills so when they graduate the students are employable. In this manner students would have options in their life.
High schools should also educate students about the history of their own country, both the good and bad side. Emphasis should be on the challenge of the goals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
