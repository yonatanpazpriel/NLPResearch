From: Douglas Thomson Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 2:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed California's curriculum COMPLAINT.
To whom this may concern,
This e-mail aims to set forth my nonconformity and public rejection as a member of the Jewish community, towards the transgressive term mentioned in the proposed California's ethnic studies curriculum. In which, a form of anti-Semitic and hate rising entitlement, portrays only the Jewish minority as "privileged".
A deplorable expression used by Nazi propaganda and prominent supremacist groups that directly insults our ethnicity, and if to be released, will target the indoctrination of children towards institutionalised aversive antisemitism, in a state that reports a highly increased rate of hate-crimes (notably regarding religious minorities).
These actions, will not be tolerated by the public and consequently, under the CA penal code, section 422.55-422.57 will evoke critical and legal ramifications.
I am calling for the protection of the Jewish identity's integrity and the re-thinking of said curriculum, that in the end must enact the respectful approbation of the State's ethnic diversity.
Regards,
-Douglas Quintero UIS Student
