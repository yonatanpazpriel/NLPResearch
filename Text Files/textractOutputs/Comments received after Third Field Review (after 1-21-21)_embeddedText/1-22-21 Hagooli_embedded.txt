The board overseeing this anti-Semitic curriculum should be ashamed of themselves. As a granddaughter of Holocaust Survivors, whose family was murdered by white supremacists, it is repulsive for this panel to refer to Jews as "privileged." Perhaps someone with some humility and empathy can be appointed to this panel to educate those in charge. With anti Semitic acts up across the globe, I should be surprised by your panel's actions, but sadly, I'm not. Disgusted. Cherie Hagooli
