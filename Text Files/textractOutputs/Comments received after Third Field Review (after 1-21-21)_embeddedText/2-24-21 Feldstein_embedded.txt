Why are BDS, hateful lyrics, Helen Thomas & Linda Sarasour included? Jews are seen as the establishment? How was the late Justice Ginsberg be the 'establishment,' while banned from schools and law firms? 100's of Jews were blacklisted via the Unamerican Affairs Committee due toi a weird name, union affiliation, etc. The area near the University of Illinois @ Chicago, 1 of my alma maters, (Maxwell St.) was referred to as Jew-town; not a compliment. I'm not saying Jews are superior. The point of ethnic studies is to show the benefits of a melting pot; not point fingers or advance questionable dogma. When hateful events occur at middle and high schools in this assembly district, there's no benefit of adding fuel to the fire state-wide. Ethnic studies should correct our having learned about L'Enfant; not Banneker. Jarvik & Jobe and not Drew. As King said, you don't address hate with other hate. You address it with information, education and acceptance. Another of my alma matters (Roosevelt University) was created as the board of the Chicago YMCA College 'needed' background info on all students, to ensure 'inferior folks;' like blacks and Jews weren't accepted. Jews were in Selma, Neshobia Mississippi, and helped found the NAACP. Problem is so few of other backgrounds know this. As with any group, there's a few who were infamous. The response shouldn't be excessive and state approved. This must stop now.
