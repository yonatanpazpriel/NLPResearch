From: Rafael Gabai [redacted] Sent: Friday, January 22, 2021 2:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ACTION ALERT: Take Action for Inclusive Ethnic Studies Education
Dear Members of the California Department of Education ,
We write to thank the California Department of Education (CDE) and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) recommendations the IQC approved in November.
We also write to urge the CDE to recommend � and the State Board of Education to approve � the following:
1. Retain the IQC's November 2020 recommendations including: � An inclusive approach to ethnic studies, and the new lessons that better reflect California's rich ethnic diversity -- Sikhs, Hindus, Koreans, Armenians, and the diversity of Jewish Americans. � New content that promotes a more balanced approach to ethnic studies, reminding teachers to expose students to multiple perspectives, teach students to think critically, and encourage students to form their own opinions. � The inclusion of lesson materials on antisemitism in Ethnic Studies and particularly, the inclusion of Lesson 40 and the IHRA definition of antisemitism, the definition that is the most widely endorsed by governments, diverse religious groups, and educational institutions worldwide.
2. Remove all ESMC content that: � Is unbalanced and inaccurate, � pushes religious and sectarian doctrine, � supports division, demonization, and discrimination, and � promotes illegal, violent, and subversive people, organizations, and action.
3. Ensure that the curriculum is consistent with accepted standards of professional responsibility and the law.
The ESMC is a crucial platform that will educate students to embrace differences, build bridges, and fight bigotry � promoting human rights and uniting our country through shared democratic values.
Thank you for your efforts to ensure an inclusive and balanced curriculum.

Sincerely, Rafael Gabai
