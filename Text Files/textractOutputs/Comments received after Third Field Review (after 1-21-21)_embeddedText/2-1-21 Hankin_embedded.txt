Hi,
I wrote to you through the "Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies" based on an article I read about the proposed curriculum that I've since learned was pretty misleading.
I do hope that the current draft includes the Jewish experience, removes some of the aggressive language re Jews/Israel, and paints a more balanced picture of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but I rescind the objections in my previous email.
I hope this important project comes to fruition.
Cheers, Mike Hankin
