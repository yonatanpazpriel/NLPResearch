From: K S Patty Sent: Sunday, February 21, 2021 11:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Guidelines for the Model Curriculum
Hello,
I read through the guidelines above and noticed that the African continent, its contributions, its history, its ancient civilizations, and how colonization carved up the continent and affected America as a budding colony were ignored. Grade 6 has a suggested curriculum and it went through every continent except Africa. That is intentional. The fact that you cover the history of every continent and culture but ignore Africa only to discuss slavery in America creates its own biased narrative.
It defeats the purpose of ethnic studies and highlights the continued neglect of the education system. It also perpetuates the belief and stereotypes and Western narrative that the African continent has no history or significant contribution to the world. Africa is the cradle of civilization.
How many African Americans were involved in this curriculum?
