In reviewing the curriculum it is very extensive and admirable in its focus on African American, Hispanic and Native American issues. Although the notes say the curriculum should not be "exhaustive" it is notable in its absence of anti-semitism or much discussion about discrimination based on religion, which continues to be a motivator of white supremacist groups. Perhaps an introductory section on reasons people discriminate and then call out race and religion generally. I think skipping anti-semitism specifically, which could include both anti-Jewish and anti-Muslim bias, is a big historical oversight. Thank you for considering the comment, Lawrence Lurvey
