From: Patrick Davarhanian [email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, January 26, 2021 2:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies and Inclusion
Good Afternoon,
My name is Patrick Davarhanian and I am a social science teacher and department chair at my school site in the Glendale Unified School District. I am emailing you today to ask you to include Armenian American experiences in your Ethnic Studies model curriculum. We have many Armenian American students in southern California schools and particularly in Los Angeles, and yet our student's stories, experiences, and cultural contributions are not reflected in our curriculum. Please make an effort to be inclusive and include Armenian Americans in your Ethnic Studies curriculum.
Thank you.
Kind Regards,
Patrick Davarhanian
