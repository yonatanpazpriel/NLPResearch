From: Marcelino, Angela Sent: Tuesday, February 9, 2021 1:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please Pass the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear whomever this email reaches,
I am emailing to express my support for the passing of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As a member of the Asian American Pacific Islander community, I think that making Ethnic Studies a distinct part of the K-12 curriculum for California public schools is a much needed addition. I think the outcome can be a positive one for future generations.
Thank you for your time,
Angela Marcelino
