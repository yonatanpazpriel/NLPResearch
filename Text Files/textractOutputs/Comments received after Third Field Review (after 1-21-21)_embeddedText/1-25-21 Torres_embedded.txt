From: Autumn Torres Sent: Sunday, January 24, 2021 12:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies <EthnicStudies@cde.ca.gov> Subject: [EXTERNAL] Against the Ethic Studies Curriculum
I am asking you to address the antisemitic changes proposed to the Ethnic Studies curriculum.
I do not support the proposed the proposed ethnic studies curriculum due to its dangerous antisemitic language that conflates Jewish identity with privilege (KKK leader David Duke uses the term "Jewish Privilege").
Jewish people need to be the ones who define their identity, and should be the ones deciding how they represented in California's schools curriculum.
Until the curriculum is revised, with input from the Jewish community in how Jewish identity and history are represented, the proposal needs to be vetoed.
