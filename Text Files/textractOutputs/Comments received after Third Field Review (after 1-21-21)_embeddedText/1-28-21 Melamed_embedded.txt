Ethnic Studies Program Coordinators,
I URGE YOU TO EDIT PROCLAMATIONS REGARDING JEWS WITHIN CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSED ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM.
Elements of the recent proposed ethnic curriculum proclaim that Jews "[gain] racial privilege" and that "anti-Jewish prejudice decreased" since the end of the Holocaust perpetuate antisemitic conspiracies about Jewish power systems.
Hate crimes towards Jews are incredibly frequent- the FBI has hate crime statistics that prove this. In the last month, our nation faced a riot on the Capitol building during which a significant number of attendees donned antisemitic and neo-nazi symbolism on attire and tattoos. Similarly, claims that Jews ALL are white-passing and "assimilate" (by abandoning their Judaism) are harmful and untrue.
Education has power as a resource to expose many for whom exposure to Jews may come solely through this change in curriculum. I urge you to reconsider your proclamations towards Jews/Judaism, past and present, within this curriculum. Please be intentional in presentation, and reach out to a number of Jewish scholars who can help improve this curriculum.
Thank you for your consideration, Shavit Melamed
