I am highly incensed that the new guidelines do not condemn anti-Semitism in any way. I would like to know who is responsible for this.
Any minority of any type needs to be protected from this awful prejudice, including those of the Jewish faith. I am not going to try and define all that people of this or any other faith has done.
PLEASE make the necessary changes to protect those who are Jewish.
