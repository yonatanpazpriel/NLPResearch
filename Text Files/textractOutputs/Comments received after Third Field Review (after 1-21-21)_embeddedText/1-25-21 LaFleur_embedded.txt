Greetings,
I am writing to voice my concerns over the depiction of Jews in the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum in the state of California. In the curriculum, Jewish people appear to be described as "privileged". This is concerning. The FBI reported that in 2019 Jewish people were the victims of 60.3% of all religiouslymotivated hate crimes in the US, around 15% of all reported hate crimes for that year. This is a 12% increase from 2018 (sources: https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2019/topic-pages/incidents-andoffenses, https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/antisemitic-incidents-hit-all-time-high-in-2019). Reminder that Jewish people make up less than 2% of the population of the United States. Additionally, the idea of "Jewish Privilege" has incredibly antisemitic roots, with origins in the idea that Jews control the banks or the world. The concept of "Jewish Privilege" is used to justify many antisemitic attacks and beliefs, as well as to belittle the discrimination Jews face. It is a common idea among Neo-Nazis and members of the Klu Klux Klan, with the term being coined by prominent Klansman David Duke. I hope the information I have shared with you will make you re-consider the way Jews are presented in the new Ethnic Studies curriculum. California is known to be a diverse and welcoming state to many groups of people such as the Latino and LGBT communities, and I hope that it may also extend that kindness to Jewish people. But with the the current planned curriculum, it will not be able to do such. I urge you to revise the plan and help California's youth be more accepting of the Jewish community and reject the world's oldest form of hatred.
Thank you, Nora
