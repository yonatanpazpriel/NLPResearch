I just read through the ethnic studies curriculum.
Comments: - Does this draft have anything good to say about America? As Asian Indian Immigrant, this country has been great to me. I had to work my head off to be succesful. Please list any comments that support Both America's Good and Bad. (Not just one sided)
- Please spell out the hardship of Communism, of the Vietnamese and Cambodian Citizens I speak to on a daily basis. About how much they Disliked Communism, and how much they love Capitalism after fleeing their country.
- Please spell out that the person who Imprisoned Japanese, it was 'Democratic' President Franklin Roosevelt. Also mention, that not only Colored ethnic Japanese were imprisoned, But German Europeans And Italians were also.
- Please spell out the Wonderful Things, US has done for immigrants. About All the Success Stories of Ethnic immigrants, and how people are praying and wishing to come to usa. We have the Longest immigration line in the world, so people are not only coming here to be "quote "Oppressed" For example, how masses of people in Poor Honduras are leaving Socialist Country, to come to a largely more Capitalistic country.
