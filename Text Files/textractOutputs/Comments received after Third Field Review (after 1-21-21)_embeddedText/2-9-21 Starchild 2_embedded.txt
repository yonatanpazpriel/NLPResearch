Communism is the enemy of Liberty, when it is being forcibly imposed by the State � just as every political or religious philosophy becomes the enemy when people seek to use State aggression to impose it on others.
If people want to practice communism voluntarily, by living in "worker"-run communes and sharing on the basis of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his need", while leaving others alone, the rest of us should be fine with that. Or if they want to live according to sharia law, or whatever � their lives, their choice. Just as if you want to live according to Biblical scripture, or accumulate lots of wealth, that should be your choice.
Government deciding which groups are favored and which aren't isn't unique to communism. Donald Trump, Barack Obama, and George Bush were all doing the same thing when they sought to disfavor some companies or industries and bail out others.
Authoritarians on both the right and left have long sought to use the law, based on the threat of government violence, to suppress speech they don't like, from left-wingers trying to criminalize "hate speech" and campaign contributions, to right-wingers trying to criminalize pornography and burning the U.S. flag.
If you can't imagine a frighteningly dystopian and authoritarian regime being based on rightwing ideology, I recommend checking out "The Handmaid's Tale" by Margaret Atwood. Only libertarianism offers the way out, by starting with the axiom that aggression is wrong no matter who does it, and no matter what their reasons. People must be allowed to live their own lives and make their own choices, even if we think they are wrong, immoral, self-destructive, or whatever, so long as their actions are not violating the equal rights of others by initiating force or fraud against them.

I am old enough to remember when most Americans understood that Communism is the enemy of Liberty. Today I see Communist tactics being employed in every aspect of American life as if this was entirely morally correct from giving government the right to decide which are the favored groups and pitting the groups against each other for government favoritism to the suppression of free speech and on and on. I quote from a letter to editor in the latest issue of the J. "In '1984' George Orwell describes a dystopian totalitarian state in which 'every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed." The objective was to completely control the lives of the population, for'who controls the past...controls the future; who controls the present controls the past." The Communists see Orwell's book not as a warning but as the playbook for their policy agenda.

EXCLUSIVE INFOGRAPHIC: China's 2020 Election Interference

For the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the 2020 presidential election in the United States was always a life and death struggle. For the first time in decades, a U.S. administration had confronted the CCP's subversion and infiltration of the United States, curtailing its expanding global influence. The CCP made clear through its state-run media that it favored a presidency under Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden, because he would be "smoother" to deal with than President Donald Trump. Beijing interfered in the 2020 election in multiple ways, and the regime was able to do this because it has, for decades, studied our society and form of government. It has systematically exploited all weaknesses in our system.
