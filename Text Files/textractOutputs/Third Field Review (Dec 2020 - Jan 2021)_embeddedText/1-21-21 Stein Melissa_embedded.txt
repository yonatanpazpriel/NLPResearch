No time to beat around the bush.... PLEASE for sake of peace and logic and honest discussions about ace & religion RETHINK YOUR PUBLICATION OF COMPLETELY ERRONEOUS, HATEFUL AND UNFOUNDED INFO... absolutely NOT facts.
If you did your due diligence, like what we try to teach our children, you would find that you are publishing lies and teaching them to maliable minds of children... perpetuating the misrepresented info as facts are creating hate.
Ift is bad enough that California is at the bottom of the list as far as states that execute a successful education system, don't start teaching preaching hate & lies. The parents in the schools will fight back and in the end you will look badly, trust me!
Please find some learned people and fix this before it is too late.
