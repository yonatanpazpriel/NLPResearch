I find it distressing that some of the people responsible for creating an inclusive ethnic studies program are stubbornly demanding that their personal biases be included.
They are part of a select group tasked with creating a good-faith program--insuring that all children learn about their classmates' ethnicities and that all children also feel good about their own.
What is preventing such an inclusive curriculum? The demand by a few to include their own personal prejudice --to the detriment of some children. One wonders: who are these adults, so poisoned by their own hatreds, yet so determined to indoctrinate young minds with their own poisoned hatreds.
It's clear the ESMC `committee' members do not share the same goal. Some members claim the right" to slip in propaganda and/or disparaging, untrue statements, especially of the anti-Israel, antisemitic kind.
I hope that, eventually, California will create an ethnic studies program that every teacher, parent, and student can be proud of.
