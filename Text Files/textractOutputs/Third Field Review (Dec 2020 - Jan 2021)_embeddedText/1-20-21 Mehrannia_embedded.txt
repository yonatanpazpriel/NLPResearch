From: SHOHREH MEHRANNIA Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Stop Ca Ethnical Model Curriculum
Hello
I am very concern with the proposed Ca Ethnical Model Curriculum that if it is approved will create devision in our community. Please do not start teaching hate to our children at school. This kind of curriculum will increase anti-Semite behavior. Please do not do that to our kids.
