From: Shauna Shakiban Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 10:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies
To Whom It May Concern I strongly oppose the ethnic studies which promotes a model that exhibits anti-Jewish bias, such as the draft's unvarnished criticism of Israel and its omission of any significant discussion of anti-Semitism
Among the changes I would request is the removal of all references to the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel
Ethnic studies should continue to be about African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos/Chicanos and Asian Americans.
With Respect Shauna Shakiban
