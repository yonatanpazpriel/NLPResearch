Hi,
Anything increase & worsen race estrangement should not be taught in school. When the school apples any race related curriculum in school, you have to think carefully. We should not focus on race issue, instead, we should focus on the concept of being an American. Every US citizen wants to be treated equally as AN AMERICAN! We are one nation under God.
Critical ethnic curriculum won't help to heal the conflicts/estrangement between different races. It will worsen the situation. Ultimately, we might even end up with another civil war. Please don't do this curriculum.
Sincerely, Lindsey
