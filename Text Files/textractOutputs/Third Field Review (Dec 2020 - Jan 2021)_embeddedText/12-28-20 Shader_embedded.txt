I am writing to express my appreciation for efforts made to recognize the virulence of antisemitism by rethinking the curriculum. Thank you for lessons 40 and 41, and for listing antisemitism as a form of bigotry and oppression. Those of us who have experienced this can attest to the importance of teaching young people to appreciate and value all people. Happy New Year, Meryl Shader
