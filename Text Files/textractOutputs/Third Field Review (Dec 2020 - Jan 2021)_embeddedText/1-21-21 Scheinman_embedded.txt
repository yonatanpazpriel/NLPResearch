After ending four years Of promoting racial division and dividing the country it is essential that all Americans do everything they can to bring this country back to what made it the greatest country in the world.
By adding openly anti-Semitic activity and studies through the California educational system that mimic ideologies of Nazi German, Is both highly concerning and extremely detrimental to the well-being and welfare of our constitution and the rights of all people. If we don't protect all the Americans then there will come a time when all Americans will no longer have protection and our country as we know it will be lost.
Studying people who may have accomplished things noteworthy is not worth the negative impact when the language they openly use is racist or anti-Semitic. Honey is often used To attract the people only to be disguised with evil intent and hatred towards certain groups. It's hard to imagine that one of the leading states in one of the greatest countries wants to perpetuate that which caused great evil to occur not less than 70 years ago. Whether it be ignorance or on purpose, Please revise the curriculum and do not promulgate such evil intended misinformation.
