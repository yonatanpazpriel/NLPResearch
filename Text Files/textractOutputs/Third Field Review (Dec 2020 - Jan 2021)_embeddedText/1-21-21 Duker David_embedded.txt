From: David Duker Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:23 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Studies Model Curriculum
As a person of conscience and a pursuer of justice and peace, I STRONGLY OBJECT to the antiSemitic themes in the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Privileged ? Celebration of bigotry and bigots ?? Anti-Semitic tropes from Hitler on down are echoed openly and subtly and need to be rooted out in the proposed curriculum. And you should examine how these warped ideas even got there in the 1st place? Hatred starts early and stays long. CA school children ought not find it in their classrooms .
