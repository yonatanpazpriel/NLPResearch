From: Emilya Shaaya Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Committee,
I hope this email finds you and you family in good health.
I am writing to strongly oppose the proposed curriculum, which is blatantly anti-Semitic and in large part reminiscent of Nazi propaganda.
I urge you to separate yourself from this attempt to cause more divide and hatred, but rather implore you to pursue the truth, unity, and humanity that our educational system and world needs.
Thank you in advance for rejection of this proposal.
Sincerely,
Emilya Shaaya
