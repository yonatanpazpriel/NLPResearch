Dear CDE members,
You have already heard from many about the long list of problems still plaguing this third iteration of the ethnic studies curriculum. But no one has addressed what I believe to be the real problem.
The same people who developed the original overtly bigoted, anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, antidemocratic, socially unbalanced, blatantly racist, divisive, propagandistic, and highly selective curriculum were put in charge of correcting those failings for an appropriate second draft. In hindsight, that this dismally flawed second draft was essentially a white-wash of the first is not too surprising, since all of the original members of the group that developed the first draft were supporters of BDS, a vitriolic anti-Semitic and anti-Israel organization.
Then, despite the fact that these same people generated a second draft nearly as bad as the first, they were tasked with repairing those failings for a third draft. And they failed again. It should be blatantly obvious that this group is ideologically committed to creating a curriculum that will inculcate anti-Jewish, anti-Israel, anti-democratic, socially unbalanced, blatantly racist, divisive, and discriminatory into our children for generations to come.
The real problem, in my opinion, is that the person (or persons) tasked with forming this committee apparently shares this ideology and wants to make sure that no matter how they are white-washed and justified and legitimized, these fundamentally anti-American concepts become part of our children's education.
If we want an even-handed, objective, comprehensive, inclusive, and democratic curriculum for our students, we must start at the top to implement the changes that can result in a curriculum that is worthy of our children's future.
