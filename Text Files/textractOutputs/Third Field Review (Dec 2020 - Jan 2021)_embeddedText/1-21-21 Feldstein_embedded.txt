Hello, It's my understanding that the proposed cultural studies curriculum includes references to Jewish people as privileged. It's also my understanding that people who were clearly anti-semitic, antiimmigrant, etc are included with positive or neutral references.
I would never suggest that Jews get specialized treatment or be treated with kid gloves. Yet, when Ruth Bader Ginsburg couldn't go to certain law schools or join certain law firms not only because of her gender but because of her faith, I'd hardly call that privileged.
When organizations nationwide were referred to as Hebrew and not Jewish to avoid hatred and informal blacklists, I hardly call that privilege. For example, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism) and the Young Men's/ Women's Hebrew Association (similar to the YMCA), were named to avoid hatred, ridicule, etc.
When Roosevelt University (where I obtained my M.A.) was formed in the mid-1940's because the YMCA Chicago College president demanded the racial and ethnic backgrounds of all students to ensure no ne'er do wells, I assure you that's not privilege.
I understand that there is not enough room for a dissertation in this curriculum. Isn't that the point? To PROMOTE all cultures in a succinct and accepting manner? I was always raised to never promote myself at the expense of others.
This very community has seen middle school students engage in hateful behavior as well as high school students (i.e. Earhart and King). We don't need publicly sanctioned judgment.
Of late, we have seen how myths, half-truths, and age-old ideals contribute not only to hate but violence. I implore you to do all you can to make it so that this needed curriculum is as free from bias as possible.
