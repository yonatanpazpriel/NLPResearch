From: Rosie Gozali Sent: Friday, January 8, 2021 2:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] The Ethnic Studies Curriculum in CA
Hello,
Im Rosie Gozali. I am a 70 American Jew. My career was as a public school teacher in San Francisco in the Early Education Dept.
Ive listened to much online about the proposals.
Im writing to say, that just as child today should know about the history of apartheid in South Africa, and what it took to end it, also
should American children know about the Palestine/Israel conflict and the important role that the BDS movement is playing out as I
write. This movement was a last resort by the Palestinians and given that it is a peaceful tactic, it should be taught. The truth should
always be taught.
I dont believe that anti-Zionism means anti-semitism. I certainly acknowledge that this country, and many other countries has its
share of ant-semitic folks who cause pain and suffering to Jews. So does racism, in general, here and all over the world. We need to
uplift all ethnic groups and teach kids the history and all the positives that our ethnic groups have contributed to this country. It is a
might task, because this country has so many groups that want and need recognition.
I ask that you bring back the orginal team who would on this curriculum. They are a group of highly educated and informed people who
can do justice to the topic. Just because Jews have sent thousands of emails, and made many calls to you, does not give them the
right to demand special treatment. The truth must be told, even if it hurts. Thanks,
Rosie Gozali
