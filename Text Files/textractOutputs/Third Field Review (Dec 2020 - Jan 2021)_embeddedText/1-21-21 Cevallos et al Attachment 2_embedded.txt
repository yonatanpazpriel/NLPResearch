Reason for change

Replace "social consciousness" with "a range of deliberative and democratic strategies to make decisions and take action"
New versions would read: " When schools help students a range of deliberative and democratic strategies to make decisions and take , they are better equipped to contribute to the public good and help strengthen democratic institutions."

It would be better if the ESMC's recommendation tracked to an approved standard for contributing to the public good. "Social consciousness, which was used here, is vague and not attributed to any source. C3 standards have already established a pathway to strengthen democracy and that is the recommended wording here.1

"The proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum helps build the capacity for every young Californian to develop a range of deliberative and democratic strategies to make decisions and take action that will contribute to the public good and, as a result, strengthen democracy."

overarching idea. It can and should be among the things studied in the history of ethnic groups, but NOT the main thing and not what makes this relevant for all backgrounds. Gaining understanding of each other is what makes this relevant for all backgrounds.

P.5 L. 93-97

Delete: "T hus, the themes and topics discussed within the field are boundless, such as a study of Mexican American texts, the implications of war and i mperialism on Southeast Asian refugees, African American social movements and m odes of resistance, and Native American/Indigenous cultural retentions, to name a few."

Imposes Critical ES ideology by blaming imperialism for Southeast Asian refugee problems (when there were MANY larger concerns at the root of their issues, including communist dictators and oppressive regimes), and by focusing on r esistance not a ll means of change.

Or remove the underlined examples.

P.6 L. 102-105

Replace "equity driven skills" and its parenthetical list, with "listening, collaboration and civic engagement skills." New version would read: "...strategies, cultural competency, and listening, collaboration and civic engagement skills."

Or replace: "k now how to organize and build coalitions" with "understand the value of coalitions" and delete "use shared power."

New version would read: "...listen to others, give people in need a voice, be able to empathize, select relevant/effective change strategies, get feedback from those they are trying to help, know how to deliberate, understand the value of coalitions)..."

Not everyone is an organizer or has the temperament or inclination to be one. This shouldn't be forced on students. Understanding the role of coalitions is valuable to all, but becoming an organizer is not, and shouldn't be evaluated as a required skill for success in life or an Ethnic Studies class. That would negate many students' natural abilities and personality traits, and is counter to inclusivity.

P. 7 L. 134

Add wording about TWLF section. "In addition to its accomplishment establishing Ethnic Studies, TWLF also advocated some damaging positions which should not be condoned. TWLF leaders unfortunately promoted antisemitism and celebrated oppressive communist dictators like Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh whose actions caused many people from various ethnic groups to flee and become refugees. This doesn't take anything away from its work creating Ethnic Studies, but acknowledges that like many movements not every facet was admirable."

While TWLF should be praised for its contribution to Ethnic Studies, the group's flaws should also be mentioned. ESMC should not ignore the fact that TWLF leaders promoted antisemitism and celebrated oppressive communist dictators like Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh (whose actions caused many people from various ethnic groups to become refugees). Especially in an Ethnic Studies course, it would be culturally insensitive to ignore these offensive elements.

Delete: "The foundational values of ethnic studies are housed in the conceptual model of the "double helix" which interweaves holistic humanization and critical consciousness. Humanization includes the values of love, respect, hope, and solidarity are based on celebration of community cultural wealth. The values rooted in humanization and critical consciousness are the guiding values each ethnic studies lesson should include."
New version would read: "Given the range and complexity of the field, it is important to identify the key values of ethnic studies as a means to offer guidance for the development of ethnic studies courses. Ethnic studies courses, teaching, and learning will:"

By saying that the values rooted in critical consciousness should be included in each lesson, this verbiage inflicts a controversial Critical Ethnic Studies ideological lens on everything taught in the ESMC. It is the Values and Principles listed below this that should be the fundamental key to the lessons, not additional nebulous values rooted in critical consciousness, which are open to interpretation.
Additionally, Critical consciousness means to gain knowledge about the inherent systemic inequity and commit to dismantle it (critical action). While many would agree that rooting out racism is essential, the CRT term of critical consciousness demands that in order to truly have a "deep understanding" of the world (ie "awakened consciousness"), all of us must see everyone and everything through the lens of these systems and these systems only.

This leaves no room for investigating or questioning the application of those systems. By CRT definition, if one questions parts of the ideology, then one is deemed to fail in achieving "awakened consciousness" and is demeaned for being part of the oppressive system.

P. 12 L. 260

Delete: "precolonial"
New version would read: "C enter and place high value on the ancestral knowledge, narratives, and communal experiences of Native people/s and people of color"

Precolonial is an unnecessary Critical ES term that duplicates the time period already described by "ancestral knowledge" and forces a narrow interpretation in the approach to Native peoples' experiences.

See reason directly below.

P. 13

Delete: "Critique empire-building in history and its relationship to

L. 263-264 white supremacy, racism and other forms of power and oppression"

This shifts the focus of the ESMC from critiquing r acism, including a ll its causes, to critiquing e mpire-building. It

Replace it with: "E xamine how race and ethnicity have been constructed in the United States and continue to shape the country today. P romote critical thinking about the complexity of the
intersections of race with gender, class, sexuality and other systems of difference that have power effects."2

inappropriately shifts the ESMC from a study of ethnicity and race to a study of foreign policy and imperialism.
It would be acceptable in the lessons to discuss colonialism and empire building as one of the many possible explanations for racism and other forms of power and oppression. However, it is not appropriate to make critique empire-building the guiding principle itself.

This is force-fitting the narrow Critical ES ideology on the ESMC. The Critical ES aims to "bring into conversation the ways that concerted efforts and collectivized resistance to US imperialism ground our approaches for dismantling the (neo)colonial schooling apparatus."3

It is at odds with the mandate established by AB 2016 whose objective is " preparing pupils to be global citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures."4

T he replacement "Examine how race and ethnicity have been constructed...power effects" are principles currently being used by the Los Angeles Unified School District's Ethnic Studies curricula. They address what should be the guiding value, which is to understand the causes and complexities of racism, and to investigate the connections with gender, class, and other categories of difference in power � throughout history and today. This revised principle better matches the objective of AB 2016 and the History Social Studies framework for Ethnic Studies.

Delete "imperialist/colonial [ and hegemonic, in footnote]"
New version would read: "Challenge racist, bigoted, discriminatory beliefs and practices on multiple levels."

See reason directly above.
Beliefs and practices should be called out because they are r acist, bigoted, or discriminatory. "Imperial/colonial" practices m ay result in racism and discrimination, or it may provide numerous benefits (including protection from invading neighbors, an influx of needed resources, end of civil war, stability, etc.). It depends on the situation. The ESMC should not assume or force one perspective of a foreign policy debate as part of a guiding principle for an ethnic studies class.

Delete "that promotes collective narratives of transformative

L. 270-271 resistance, c ritical hope, and radical healing"

Add: "Focus on the experiences, histories, cultures, struggles and accomplishments of specific ethnic/racial groups within American history and society with an emphasis on t ruth and healing t hrough empathy and education."5

There is no ESMC principle about inspiring students by seeing ethnic group accomplishments, or any value about empathy, yet that is central to AB 2016's stated purpose. A new Guiding Principle should be added. Also, the words "transformative resistance," "critical," and "radical," are easily misinterpreted Critical ES buzzwords that can have multiple meanings � some of which are problematic, encouraging violence and separatist resistance, so they should be replaced.

P. 16 L. 340-344

Delete: "i ncluding both by individuals and by institutions. The inequitable institutional treatment of certain racial and ethnic groups is sometimes referred to as systemic racism."
New version would read: "Those myriad of categories influence, but do not necessarily determine, one's life trajectory. They also may influence how a person is perceived and treated by others."

This definition does not belong here - it misses the point of the rest of the paragraph. The paragraph is about the intersection of "multiple social categories"such as sexual orientation, age, religion, disability, and other categories with ethnicity. Institutional mistreatment of this convergence of categories is not racism � it is a broader discrimination. There are plenty of other references and descriptions of systemic racism elsewhere that are germane; this one is not.

P. 16 L. 353

The goal isn't to force a connection among movements, but to look for r elevant similarities and connections.

New version would read: "Ensure fair, balanced pedagogy." Or alternately, "Ensure fair, impartial pedagogy."

Reason for change
This curriculum should not be an evangelical effort to indoctrinate parents and the broader community � especially if the narrow Critical ES ideology is not removed. This is overstepping the mandate of AB 2016.
This is a loaded CRT term and the word "humanizing" was NOT part of the cited source (United Teachers LAUSD Contract).

Recommended change

Reason for change

Delete "transformation," "political change and liberation." And delete the footnote "Paulo Freire, Pedagogy of the Oppressed (New York, NY: Bloomsbury, 2000), 71."
New version would read: "Ethnic studies teaching is grounded in the belief that education can be a tool for social and economic change."

Liberation forces an inflammatory, judgmental assumption that students or ethnic communities in the US are currently enslaved and need to be liberated. "Transformation", when attributed to Paolo Freire, is CRT shorthand for transformative resistance, which is inappropriate pedagogical guidance. Teachers are not supposed to advocate for revolution or be tools for political change in the classroom.

P. 4-5 L. 65-69

Replace: "Community - Ethnic studies teaching and learning is meant to serve as a bridge between educational spaces/institutions and community. Thus, encouraging students to apply their knowledge to practice being agents of change, social justice organizers and advocates, and engaged citizens at the local, state, national, and global levels." with "Community - Ethnic studies teaching and learning can help students apply a range of deliberate & democratic strategies and procedures to make decisions and take actions in their classrooms, schools, and out of school civic contexts. "

This coerces students to be community organizers or public advocates, even though that might not be how they choose to engage in civic life.
The goal is certainly to engage in civic life, but there are lots of options for how students become engaged citizens, such as voting, writing letters to the editor, signing petitions, etc. Not everyone is temperamentally an advocate or organizer; students should have agency in how they engage.

This shouldn't be about forcing a Critical ES ideology on students, or requiring them to see the world through that narrow lens. The goal as stated earlier in this section is to inspire students by seeing "themselves represented" in the literature and gaining "self-affirmation."

Add the word "approved"
"... educators should consult the University of California-approved ethnic studies course outlines that are included in Appendix C..."

Educators should not be consulting UC ethnic studies course outlines, which would often be inappropriate for K-12 students. This sentence is meant to refer teachers to consult the UC-approved ethnic studies courses that are included in Appendix C.

P. 17 L. 395-397

Delete "critical" and "critical race theory." Replace with "multicultural education" 13
Add footnote 1 3 w ith the following definitions: "The National Association for Multicultural Education described multicultural education as a "philosophical concept built on the ideals of freedom, justice, equality, equity, and human dignity as acknowledged in various documents, such as the U.S. Declaration of Independence, constitutions of South Africa and the United States, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations" (National Association of Multicultural Education, 2011) Banks and Banks (2001). Multicultural education: issues and perspectives define multicultural education as: "An idea, an educational reform movement, and a process whose major goal is to change the structure of educational institutions so that male and female students, exceptional students, and students who are members of diverse racial, ethnic, language, and cultural groups will have an equal chance to achieve academically in school.""

Critical race theory should not be the "key theoretical framework" for ESMC. It is one of many race theories, so should not be assumed as the unchallenged answer and underpinning for the curriculum. Students should not be indoctrinated into a ny single ideology.
Moreover, CRT is divisive, controversial, and discriminatory, defining students as oppressed and oppressor based on their immutable characteristic of skin color. In an advanced high school class, the pros and cons of various racial ideologies and their component parts could be discussed, but even then CRT would not be the assumptive, foundational framework for a course, especially when there are examples of successful Ethnic Studies curricula taught today that do not require CRT.

P. 21 L. 488-490

Replace "for liberation" with "against racism"
New version would read: "...t he importance African Americans played in the formation of the United States, the oppression they faced, the exploitation of black labor, and the continued fight against racism."

The words "fight for liberation" create an incorrect, inflammatory assumption of ongoing slavery in the US, and borders on a call for revolution.

P. 22 L. 519-523

Delete U.S. imperialism
New version would read: "The common experiences that unite these diverse populations are their indigenous and African roots/identities, the experience and ancestral memories of European colonization, cultural practices, migration, resistance, and colonial languages (i.e., Spanish and Portuguese).

While some countries were influenced by US diplomacy or wars, that is not a unifying common trait amongst all ethnic groups referred to, which would be needed for inclusion in this list.

P. 30

Delete: "They will learn about the interlocking systems of oppression

L. 757-758 and privilege that impact all people."

"Interlocking systems of oppression" is a CRT term that means that every person has social and racial identities that combine to create different modes of inherent oppression, created by White, male, heterosexual privilege. CRT maintains that racism is widespread and ingrained in society, and therefore having any one of these social or racial identities results in automatic oppression. This line is an attempt to broaden the "oppressed" category and it evaluates a person's identities through a narrow negative, CRT-based lens.
9

This statement assumes that all lived experiences for anyone falling into this category is negative and is the result of White power and privilege.

The goal of the ESMC is to "empower students" and "advance respect for and better understanding". This statement instead tells students that if they identify with any of these social or racial groups, they are inherently oppressed, not empowered.

P. 30

Delete: "associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and

L. 766-767 institutional racism"

New version would read: "...b ring positive change that helps build a future society free of racism and other forms of bigotry."

ESMC should aspire to a society free of ALL forms of racism and bigotry, not just those "associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and institutional racism." That's too narrow a definition.

Add "and the rise of communist control"
New version would read: "S outheast Asian Refugee Crisis � Students can discuss the implications of the Vietnam War and the rise of Communist control on Vietnamese, Cambodian..."

This portrays a history from a narrow anti-Western pro-Marxist Critical ES ideological perspective. It lacks balance. The broader perspective is required to ensure balanced student inquiry rather than forcing a predetermined Critical ES interpretation of history.

Delete: "political" "anti-imperial and anti-colonial movements".
New version would read: "T he challenges and opportunities faced by South Asian immigrants to California will allow students to learn about

New version would read: "T he founding of Stockton Gurdwara, the first-ever Sikh place of worship in the United States in 1912, served as a focal point for immigrants across communities."

The paragraph is about milestones of South Asian immigrants to the US. The first Sikh place of worship is relevant, as is its focal point for the immigrant community. Its relationship to a political party, as well as one of that party's political positions, is irrelevant and forced. The anti-colonial message is inappropriately inserted because of the Critical ES approach.

P. 38 L. 971-974

Delete: "Systems of power can be analyzed using the four "I"s of oppression (ideology, institutional, interpersonal, and internalized)."
Add: "and efforts to revise these systems to become fairer."
New version would read: "Discussions of systems of power should include the struggles that come with being entangled and impacted by these systems, the resistance to them, and efforts to revise these systems to become fairer."

While it may be ok to use a modified version of the 4 I's analysis, without further definition, this is a problematic reference and should be removed here. In Critical ES, the 4 I's include offensive material, which have been edited out by CDE in ESMC's one lesson implementation of 4 I's (Appendix A, P. 108). Recommending the 4 I's as a stand-alone here encourages use of the original, divisive version, including the line, "Interpersonal racism is what white people do to people of color up close � racist jokes, stereotypes..." But this behavior is not color-specific. The ESMC redefined it to say "Interpersonal racism is what some members of a racial group do to members of a different racial group up close..."

Also, discussions of systems of power should include successful efforts made to revise laws to make systems fairer.

Add (after list item 1, before the box): "2. Acknowledge the pros and cons of the TWLF movement and point out that no social movement is immune from perpetuating harmful ideology, despite positive goals. Share with students that the TWLF has flaws which are appropriate to note, as with any other group. For example, TWLF has been criticized because its leadership at times promoted antisemitism and celebrated oppressive communist dictators like Vladimir Lenin, Mao Zedong, and Ho Chi Minh, whose actions led many people from various ethnic groups to flee and establish communities in California."

While TWLF should be praised for its contribution to Ethnic Studies, the group's flaws should also be acknowledged. ESMC should not ignore the fact that TWLF leaders promoted antisemitism and celebrated oppressive communist dictators whose actions caused many people from various ethnic groups to become refugees.
Especially in an Ethnic Studies course, it would be culturally insensitive to ignore these affronts. L esson should include honest information about the ethnically insensitive aspects of the movement, not just paint a rosy picture.

P. 30-35 Delete: Lesson 5 � Introducing Dominant Narratives L. 670-816

Lesson 5 is a college curriculum that is inappropriate to insert in a high school for numerous reasons. It forces students to accept as given the following one-sided perspectives (all of which should be, but cannot be, questioned):

13

 All students of color are oppressed victims without agency and all whites are dominant oppressors.
 The US government cannot be trusted.  All dominant narratives are inherently false.  All dominant narratives are "meant to silence
alternative accounts."  All dominant narratives are designed to serve
the dominant group (whites) and intentionally harm the minority (BIPOC).  There is a unified dominant narrative perpetuated by media repetition.  Participation by individuals spreading the dominant narrative is "enforced."
Much of the lesson's framing language, including overall description, definitions, questions, and worksheets, are lifted from the college class which indoctrinates students to this ideology.
To be clear, the lesson doesn't ask IF dominant narratives are enforced or IF they are intended to cause harm, or IF they silences others etc.; the lesson assumes it all occurs and asks questions about who, what and how.
In addition to the mistaken assumptions in the ideology outlined above, the lesson also raises following concerns:
 Students are defined and judged by the random color of their skin (over which they have no control) not their thoughts or actions (over which they have agency)
 The dominant group is pre-determined to be wrong, manipulative and desirous of inflicting harm based on skin color alone.
14

 Students are force fed one particular ideology.  The lesson assumes a predetermined answer
regarding something about which there are multiple perspectives.

While perhaps acceptable for some college classes, this is inappropriate for a California high school course. As stated eloquently by the LAUSD Elements of a Balanced Curriculum 2017, "At the college and university level, ethnic studies and related courses are sometimes taught from a specific political point of view or frame of reference.

This is a leading question with a Critical ES ideological lens. First, it forces the narrow assumption that to be a figure of significance one had to "challenge systems of white supremacy."

For the next 11 recommended changes, please note the assignment requires students to "become their figure," speak "in the voice of the individual," and present "to the whole class." This would force students to justify and advocate to their peers the violent or offensive positions from the figures identified below. In most cases, it does not take more than a simple Google search of the figure's names for students to find such offensive comments. Especially for the instances of ethnic slurs, no student should have to be in the position of defending, or even consuming that information.
The figures listed below should be deleted or replaced, to avoid such a situation.
Abu-Jamal was convicted of first degree murder of a police officer and frequently quoted Mao "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." There is no reason to focus on violence as the best means for social change. There are so many people who accomplished things against herculean odds without resorting to violence. If the point is to discuss discrimination in the legal system, cite Bryan Stevenson (founder of Equal Justice Initiative). If the point is to discuss prison reform, cite Deanna Van Buren or Topeka K. Sam.
She and her husband Marcus urged Jamaicans to rally against Chinese and Syrian immigrants, praised the KKK and used violent rhetoric against mixed race people and Jews. Garvey's support of hatred and racism should not be celebrated.
She advocates antisemitic beliefs and is First Lady of the Nation of Islam, tracked as a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. The curriculum should not promote people who encourage hatred and discrimination.

In 2018, she even had to step down from her position as co-chair of the well-known "Women's March" for such widely-condemned hateful comments. People who promote hate should not be celebrated by the curriculum and their views should not be given a microphone in the classroom.

It is appropriate and important to acknowledge the pros and cons of movements and topics being discussed. It is a crucial piece of guidance to assist student learning before starting their research, as well as to set expectations for the presentations they will share with the class.
This would also help ensure adherence to the guidelines the ESMC established in chapter 1, page 18, line 418-419, that "Students will actively seek to understand, analyze and articulate multiple points of View and perspectives."

For example, MEChA (line 2757-2759) is a critical organization for Chicano student life on many college campuses; however, they also have a controversial past with incidences of racism against other communities, sexism, and antisemitism. Known also for focus on separatist Chicano identity (including reconquista, the idea that Mexico should reconquer Southwestern US states). It's great to learn about them. It's also key to mention both the positives and the negatives.

New version would read: " Discuss implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too small of a community to care about by political leaders or documented by historians. Discuss how in some instances racism and discrimination against Asian Americans can be systemic."

Discrimination and racism can exist without being systemic; this forces a systemic presumption, and while racism against Asian Americans h as at times been systemic, this goes beyond what the lesson and texts themselves imply. The text of the original submitted lesson is more in line with this tone.

New version would read: "a striking example of how the "American body politic was altering, to be inclusive of Asian Americans, which, at the very least implied that the government was no longer committed to discriminatory practices of segregation and white race-based citizenship."

The language that says that America was "committed to" white supremacy" is unnecessarily antagonistic. There were Congress members at the time who were overtly racist, but at the same time, many of these views referenced in the text coincided with a politically complicated time in which anti-Communist paranoia was at an all-time high, which frequently correlated with their racism (particularly from Asian and Latin American countries). This doesn't excuse their racism, but it does not necessarily require a commitment to implementing white supremacy as a policy. A subtle world change better reflects the nuanced situation.

While it was true that there were even self-stated white supremacists in Congress at the time, this point doesn't fit the context of the paragraph in which this sentence is placed.

This question doesn't match the ed. standard which it references. According to the preceding sentence, this question is supposed to link H istory and Social Science standard, 8.12.7, which states students should: "identify new sources of large-scale immigration and the contributions of immigrants to the building of cities and the economy; explain the ways in which new social and economic patterns encouraged assimilation of newcomers into the mainstream amidst growing cultural diversity; and discuss the new wave of nativism." The essential question that is proposed in this lesson plan focuses on racial oppression and not on the contributions of Asian immigrants.

It is acceptable to understand how US involvement in the war drew Cambodia into the conflict, but US involvement did not instigate the blood bath of the Cambodian genocide.

The CDE removed the term "white privilege" from all other ESMC lessons (in each of the last two review cycles). CDE has also tried to remove the blatant shaming of white people resulting from judging them solely on the color of their skin (rather than their actions or behavior).

New version would read: "Prejudice against Jews and Catholics from Eastern and Southern Europe and desire to preserve the idea of US homogeneity motivated the passing of the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924, greatly restricting Jewish immigration through 1965."

The CDE removed the term "privilege" from all other ESMC lessons (in each of the last two review cycles). CDE has also tried to remove the blatant shaming of white people resulting from judging them solely on the color of their skin (rather than their actions or behavior). That removal should continue here. It is demeaning, and divisive to pit white people against people of color. The message of the lesson can be told clearly without that language.

Add "redlining regulations restricting home ownership" to the list of ways Jews were targeted.
New version would read: "...the white supremacist racism of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) saw Jews as non-white, a separate and lesser race, and targeted Jews, such as with exclusionary immigration legislation, redlining regulations restricting home ownership, and intimidation in large marches on Washington DC."

Adding redlining helps connect this to a previous lesson where students learned about this discriminatory practice. This would be consistent with ESMC Outcome 4, developing a better understanding of others, which states "simultaneously learn to understand ethnic differences while also identifying underlying commonalities and personal challenges." (Ch. 1, P. 15, L. 325-327)

Replace "led" with "forced"
New version would read: "Through the 1960s, antisemitic employment discrimination with overt and covert `no Jews allowed' notices often forced Jews to enter new industries with less discrimination."

There was no choice in the matter. Employment discrimination forced Jews into certain jobs because others prohibited them from participation. This lack of control should be made clear by replacing "led" with "forced."

Delete: "gaining racial privilege" and replace "social" for "racial"
New version would read: "Descendants of Jewish immigrants often assimilated and changed their position on the social hierarchy from their immigrant parents."

The CDE removed the term "privilege" from all other ESMC lessons (in each of the last two review cycles). CDE has also tried to remove the blatant shaming of white people resulting from judging them solely on the color of their skin (rather than their actions or behavior). That removal should continue here. It is demeaning, and divisive to pit white people against people of color. It also unjustly oversimplifies the experiences of Jewish Americans in relation to whiteness and "privilege."

See reason directly above for change regarding "white privilege"

New version would read: "Light-skinned Jews simultaneously gain acceptance on the basis of their appearance, while experiencing prejudice, discrimination, and systematic antisemitism on the basis of their Jewishness."

The other replacement is for clarity. Original sentence was confusing.

Recommended change
Replace the unvetted list of A-G courses in Appendix C with courses which are not based on a Critical ES approach, such as that of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The CDE has not verified or reviewed the course content in this Appendix,1 2 and the UC Office of the President did not have Ethnic Studies curricular guidelines to adhere to when approving these electives. See several examples of what should be deleted, below.

Delete: Ethnic Studies-Academic Language Development 2 ( San Juan HS, Citrus Heights)

This course is based on a foundation promoting CRT, which is only one of many race theory alternatives. The entire framework is one of oppression and resistance, and is not consistent with the goals of AB 2016. This course approaches US institutions, including education, healthcare, housing, legal,economic, etc, from an oppression/resistance lens. It is counter to the ESMC guidance for multiple perspectives, and ignores experiences and accomplishments of ethnic groups that were not focused on resistance.

This is a course which imposes Critical ES ideology. The introduction describes it as, " A critical analysis of
systems of oppression and privilege and how they impact and shape resistance, consciousness, and identity."1 3

This course also includes sections glorifying violence.
For example, it includes the song "Malcolm, Garvey, Huey."1 4

This course focuses primarily on forms of oppression and resistance. "The culminating assessment for this unit will be a performative piece which will demonstrate student mastery of the concepts/constructs of colonization, hegemony, forms of oppression ( i.e. Racism, classism, sexism,hetero-sexism,homophobia), prejudice, stereotypes and discrimination."1 8
