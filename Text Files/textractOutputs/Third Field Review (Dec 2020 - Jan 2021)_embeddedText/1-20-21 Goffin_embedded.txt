hi
Can you please explain why "white Jews" are privileged?
I'm white, and Jewish. My family was all but killed in the Holocaust and I have experienced anti-Semitism since a child. Mostly on the east coast where I grew up.
How are you helping ensure peace and justice actually with words in your curriculum that distinguish between white (and therefore privileged) Jews and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed)?
This feels racist and anti-Semitic at the same time...somehow...
This appears very clearly wrong. What are you trying to accomplish? Please help me understand .
David
