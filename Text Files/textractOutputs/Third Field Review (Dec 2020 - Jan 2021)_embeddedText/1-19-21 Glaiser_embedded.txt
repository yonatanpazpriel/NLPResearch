From: Cheryl Glaiser Sent: Sunday, January 17, 2021 9:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Why has the feedback form been removed?
To Ethnic Studies Department
I was hoping to give my feedback on the ethnic studies class but the form has been pulled down so I will give it in this email.
I sure hope I don't have to tell you that by calling out races for the good, bad and ugly only divides us more. Yes our past has shown that certain races were mistreated but calling it out now only reinforces divide.
We are all human beings and DNA testing companies have shown us that we all carry genes from all over the world. Wouldn't it make sense to have a curriculum that teaches us to NOT see color, gender etc but only a fellow human being. Making people feel bad or guilty because of their color, gender etc is wrong. You will be propagating victim hood and that is a path to loneliness and the inability to succeed in life.
California is a very diverse state which contributes to its beauty and uniqueness. The future of California residents will be of mixed race; that is the natural progression with a diverse society. And it's great for human existence and a beautiful thing. Where are these children going to fit in your model? Making them choose an identity it wrong. The identity we all need to choose is "human" and curricula should focus on that. Sincerely Concerned CA Citizen
