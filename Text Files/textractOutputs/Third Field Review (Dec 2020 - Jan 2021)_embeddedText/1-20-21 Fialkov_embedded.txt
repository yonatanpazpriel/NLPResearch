From: Howie Fialkov Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies Bill
Good afternoon,
I am sending this email to voice my objection to implementing the Ethnic studies program as presently drafted
The program as drafted is filled with anti Jewish information
One example of may is that this program refers to Jews as privileged and is the only group designated as such
The authors of this program, even if they are minorities themselves, harbor tremendous racist and anti Jewish sentiments
Please do not add to the grave increasing amounts of anti Jewish sentiment by teaching the youth to hate Jews
Thank you
