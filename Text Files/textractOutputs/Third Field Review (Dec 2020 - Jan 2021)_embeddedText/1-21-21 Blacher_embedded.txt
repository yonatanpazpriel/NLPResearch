From: Home Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to voice my concern about the way Jews - and those opposed to Jews, Judaism, and Jewish selfdetermination - are characterized in the model curriculum. Unfortunately my concerns, which have been shared by many, seem to be falling on deaf ears. Though Jews are consistently singled out for hate crimes more than any other group, the model curriculum provides a warped view, particularly of Jews who actually practice Judaism and support and embrace a Jewish homeland.
