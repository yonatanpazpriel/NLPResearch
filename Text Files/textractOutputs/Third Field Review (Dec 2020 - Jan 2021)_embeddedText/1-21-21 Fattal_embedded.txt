It is with a heavy heart that I write this. I a Semetic woman a Jew like all Jews an Israelite a minority from the MENA SANA region. A perpetual refugee like all Jews, who's scars run deep, to have to once more face racism and hate. To not be labeled by our scars and have our stories of oppression genocide and inequality be told so it can truly be never again for anyone anywhere, but instead have our pains be categorized by the shades and tones of our skin. Our traumas be validated only by the shades of our skin and not the scars on our souls. We are once more being victimized in our adoptive home the USA. Even amongst semetic people of all nationalities and religions you can find blue eyed fair skinned cousins and dark featured family members. When all of these families were targeted for their religion and Murdered or exiled and rendered refugees with nothing more than the satchel on their backs and the scars in their hearts no body cared to look at the shade of their skin and give them immunity from racism and persecution. Today this persecution is once more being perpetuated not in the lawlessness of dictatorships and totalitarian regimes but in the land where equality and dignity to all should be afforded, the home of these perpetual refugees the wanderers of the earth the children of Israel in all our shades and colors. Judaism is not only a religion but an ethnicity and telling us how we should be defined is not only fascist it's bigoted Jew hatred and has no place in democracy. Stop the revictimization. Us Jewish immigrants of all shades and Hughes are feeling unwelcome and our Collective ptsd is telling us that our children are once more no longer safe in our homeland and that the age old plague of Antisemitism is once more slowly rearing its ugly head.
