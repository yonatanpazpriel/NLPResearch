From: Debbi Parrott Sent: Friday, January 15, 2021 5:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] teacher in support of ethnic studies requirement
I am a public highschool English teacher in support of the ethnic studies requirement. It priorities a contextual understanding of our nation's history, builds empathy in our students, and helps do active anti-racist work and builds awareness of bias. This can help develop citizenship in our students, help them be more civically engaged, and foster dialogue and understanding between those with different perspectives. Thank you, -Debbi Parrott
