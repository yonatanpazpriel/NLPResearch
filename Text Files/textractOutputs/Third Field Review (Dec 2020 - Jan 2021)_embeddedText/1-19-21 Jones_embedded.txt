From: Gary E. Jones Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 8:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Social Justice in our schools
While I am anti-racist the teaching of social justice in our schools concerns me. The values of religion have not been allowed in public schools for a long time. Why is it that the values of a particular group now have somehow over-shadowed this basic argument of not teaching morals in our public schools?
The recent incident at the R.I. Meyerholz Elementary School in Cupertino, California is a good example of how deeply people feel about their values, one way or the other, being forced on our children in public schools. Our Nextdoor is alive with neighbors expressing support/opposition to what happened.
I'm writing this email to express my opposition to the teaching of social justice in our public school system. IMHO should this become a teaching standard it will only serve to drive the wedge of divide among parents, the voters and others. Please don't "cancel" the rule-of-law as it has existed, values and religion are the responsibility of parents and not our public school system.
Respectfully,
