From: Michael Lackner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 2:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies should not provoke Ethnic Prejudice and Honor those who Spread Hate
The proposed "Ethnic Studies" program will do far more harm than good, by officially importing ethnic prejudices into the classroom.
Shoehorning everything into the single narrative of race is a distortion of reality, as the bigoted characterization of Jews in the program demonstrates.
Furthermore, much of the language used has been crafted to evoke hatred and resentment, producing division instead of unity. It is destructive to the psyches of our children, by importing prejudice and by honoring figures who have promoted hate. Specifically hatred of Jews.
Please do not mandate this program in our public schools.
