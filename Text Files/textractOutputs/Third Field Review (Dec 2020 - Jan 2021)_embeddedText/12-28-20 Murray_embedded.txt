From: Steve Murray Sent: Monday, December 28, 2020 1:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Comments
California Department of Education:
I am a retired secondary teacher with 35 years of experience teaching grades 6-12 mathematics, history and English.
My concern with the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is twofold: 1. The use of Critical Race Theory (CRT) teaches division among students. I would ask those involved
with this curriculum to place themselves in front of a class of 35 diverse students. Consider the result of CRT dividing students into victims and oppressors. Would this lead to more understanding and cooperation or would it lead to more anger and division? I believe it would lead to the latter and, at this point in history, we don't need more of that.
2. The tone of the draft is negative. There is insufficient emphasis on all the economic and educational progress for poor and minority people that has been achieved since the 1964. Steven Pinker's book Enlightenment Now shows specific metrics of progress that can lead to a healthy understanding that American society has made efforts to address inequity while there is still work to be done. Also, on the topic of negativity, why list Mumia Abu-Jamal and Assata Shakur and not highlight Martin Luther King's wonderful idealism and achievements?
Sincerely, Steve Murray
