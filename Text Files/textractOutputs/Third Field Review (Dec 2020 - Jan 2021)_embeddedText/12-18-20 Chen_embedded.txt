Dear committee,
I do not agree to install this course in public schools. Education Department should focus on teaching fundamental scientific knowledge and literature, history based on facts not opinions, critical thinking skills not party agenda. With due respect, you have failed our students miserably on all above areas, especially those desperately need help, families in underserved communities students falling further behind.
Please do not waste our time and resources to promote certain party's agenda. It's a racist curriculum. It will divide our community further apart.
Sincerely,
Concerned parent
