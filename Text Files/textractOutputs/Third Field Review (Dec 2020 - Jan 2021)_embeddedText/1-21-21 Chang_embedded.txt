From: Edward Chang Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
California students deserve Ethnic Studies that does not water down the impact of race on people of color. Please maintain all the lesson plans which concerned Californians have contributed and allow local teachers the choice of including what best meets the needs of their students. Please do not give into the organized right wing attack on what they call Critical Ethnic Studies.
