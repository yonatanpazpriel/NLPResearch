From: Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies; [email redacted]; SBE Cc: [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please Remove Critical Ethnic Studies Foundation from ESMC
Dear California Department of Education Staff, Members of the State Board of Education, President Linda Darling-Hammond, and Governor Gavin Newsom,
Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies is a grassroots coalition of parents, teachers, students, and immigrants. Our members are Black, Asian, Latinx, White. We span the spectrum of political affiliations, and the immigrants among us come from all over the world.
We support Ethnic Studies that builds inter-group understanding and empathy, inspires students with the variety of contributions by ethnic groups, encourages civic engagement, and honestly addresses racism and discrimination.
We appreciate the work to date of the CDE in attempting to make the ESMC both more inclusive and balanced of various perspectives, as intended by AB-2016 and noted by Governor Gavin Newsom.
Yet we remain deeply concerned that the ESMC has been hijacked by the particular field of Critical Ethnic Studies ï¿½ a field that promotes a narrow political agenda and stifles inquiry. We urge you to implement the attached crucial edits, in order to ensure that California's Ethnic Studies promotes inquiry not ideological dogma, and fosters community not divisiveness among groups.
Attached are the summary of change requests, as well as detailed edits, including chapter, page, and line numbers.
Thank you for your work on behalf of our state's children.
Best regards,
Mauricio Cevallos Immigrant and Co-founder, Latinx for Quality Education
