RE: Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear members of the State Board of Education �
On behalf of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander American Affairs (CAPIAA), I am writing in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), as well as to provide a public comment in order to strengthen the overall Asian American and Pacific Islander (AA&PI) Studies section. I have also provided detailed recommendations per AA&PI Studies sample lesson.
CAPIAA elevates the political, economic, and social issues of Asians American and Pacific Islander communities by contributing to and strengthening how state government addresses the needs, issues, and concerns of the diverse and complex AA&PI communities. AA&PI communities consists of over 50 different ethnic communities and over 100 different spoken languages. One-third of the AA&PI population in the United States (US) reside in California where 6,762,404 Asian Americans and 155,871 Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders1 call California home.
Recommendations to improve Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies section
AA&PI communities have different migration stories to the United States (US) yet experience similar structural racism. Thus, it is the upmost importance for California's ESMC to introduce and highlight the variation of AA&PI experiences for California's students to learn the diversity and complexity of the AA&PI community. In order to strengthen the AA&PI Studies section of the curriculum, we recommend the following:
� Move Sample Lesson 31: Asian American and Pacific Islander and the Model Minority Myth to the front of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies to make it the first sample lesson of this section. This lesson serves as a great comprehensive introduction to AA&PI studies, as well as highlights the diversity of the ethnic communities, languages, cultures, needs and challenges.
� Include refugee as a key term � in the Hmong, Vietnamese, and Lao American sample lessons. Pull refugee key term from Lesson 32: Cambodian American � Deportation Breaking Families, pg. 368; line 7808. It is important for students to learn the conditions and impacts refugee communities face before and after they resettle into the United States.

� Move Lesson 39: The Sikh-American Community in California and Lesson 42: Arab American Stereotypes in Literature, Film, and Media Pre and Post-9/11 into the Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies section.
� While this ESMC is a great start, it is by no means captures the various experiences of structural racism and the fight for social justice and equity of all Californians. o Thus, the ESMC must be updated every couple of years by the California Department of Education (CDE) in order to expand the general curriculum to include the stories and resiliency all AA&PI communities, including Iu-Mien, Bhutanese, Samoan, Tongan, etc. o CDE must encourage California's public K-12 school districts to become more knowledgeable of the various AA&PI communities that attend their schools to supplement appropriate curriculum that is not reflected in the model curriculum. For example, West Contra Costa Unified School District has one of the largest Khmu American population and should provide lessons that will teach the Khmu American experience in the city of Richmond, Pinole, and Hercules.

Question: How will students have access to Korean Americans

to interview if they do not live in an area with a Korean

American population? I recommend that the curriculum

provides an alternative � i.e. watching short clips identified by

original author of the same curriculum, list a handful of Korean-

serving non-profit in California that would be open to doing an

interview, or pull from the following sample lessons of Col.

Young Oak Kim, Dr. Sammy Lee, etc.

Sample Lesson 22: Col. Young Oak Kim - Sample Lesson 26: Dr. Sammy Lee (1920-

2016) � No comment

Sample Lesson 27: Korean Popular Culture in the United States � recommend the curriculum acknowledges and make an explicit connection of the influence of Black music (R&B and rap) on Korean Popular culture. What will also move this sample lesson towards an Ethnic Studies framework is to connect Korean Pop group BTS' fanbase organized efforts to successfully fundraise $1 million for the Black Lives Matter movement.

Under "Potential Significant Figures to Cover"� while this list is

had significant impacts in the local community they

reside (i.e. in Sacramento, Lao American advocate,

Chantha Peter Liemthongsamout, organized and build

the first Lao American temple in Sacramento. He is most

likely not in any history books and may not be known by

the teacher but a student may be aware and want to

highlight this individual), and

� Expand the list to be more diverse of Asian American

figures by including �

� Doua Thor

� Early farm agitations does not fit the "model minority" analysis.

� Sikh/Punjabi events should be broken up.

� The sample lesson needs to make a stronger connection to the misconceptions of the

Model Minority Myth. Recommendation for educator to pull from Lesson 31.

Thank you to CDE (including the Ethnic Studies Curriculum writers, the ESMC committee, the Instructional Quality Commission, the State Board of Education, and everyone behind the scenes) for all of your work on this historical ESMC. We are excited to see the outcome of the final model curriculum.
We urge you to make the necessary edits to strengthen the Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies sample lessons. If you have any questions, please reach out to me directly at ccapiaa@gmail.com.
