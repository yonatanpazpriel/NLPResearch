RE: Public Comments for Third Field Review of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
On behalf of the Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC) and the undersigned organizations of the Coalition Helping to Achieve Racial and Gender Equity (CHARGE), we write with four purposes:
1. To provide comments on the latest revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), specifically on the sample lessons related to Asian American and Pacific Islander history;
2. To advocate for more extensive revisions to the sample lesson plan on Vietnamese American Experiences and provide further sources, structure, and guidance for instructors;
3. To advocate for including Arab American Studies, including Palestine, in Asian American and Pacific Islander studies; and
4. To advocate for a thorough review of the ESMC by ethnic studies experts and ensure that the principles, values, and pedagogy center on the experiences of communities of color
AAPI CHARGE, coordinated by SEARAC, is a statewide youth and community centered movement that works toward building the advocacy capacity of AAPI youth, empowering them to seek equitable policy change and shift narratives on AAPI communities. CHARGE provides AAPI young people a platform to amplify their voices across California. Our coalition focuses on increasing Southeast Asian American and Pacific Islander visibility, including through advocacy of adequate educational support and ethnic studies courses that teach youth about our history and cultural identities and dismantle the `model minority' myth.
We sincerely appreciate the California Department of Education's effort to ensure appropriate implementation of AB 2016 (Alejo) by revising drafts of the model curriculum and considering public comments from August 2019 and September 2020. We further appreciate the decision to retain the four core fields of study under the ESMC, focused on African American, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Chicanx and Latinx, and Native American Studies. While we applaud the efforts to include and reform the breadth of Southeast Asian American and Pacific Islander studies, we sincerely urge the CDE to draw from community stakeholder feedback and ethnic studies experts to provide a nuanced review of the ESMC and ensure a curriculum that reflects the needs of our students, is anti-racist, and protects the integrity of ethnic studies as pioneered by the Third World Liberation Front and Black Student Union.

In this final field review, we respectfully request that the ESMC include revisions provided through comments in Attachment A, as well as the more thoroughly revised sample lesson on Vietnamese American Experiences in Attachment B below. We urge the Instructional Quality Commission to protect the ESMC, carefully review the curriculum, consult ethnic studies experts, and make the appropriate changes and additions, including those proposed below. These changes will be crucial to the success of the students from school districts that will turn to the ESMC for guidance. We look forward to continuing this partnership as we seek to ensure that all students in California are able to learn about their own and other's histories toward cultural awareness, self-determination, and community. Please reach out to SEARAC's Director of California Policy, Mandy Diec at mandy@searac.org if you have any questions.

Page 23 Line 553: Please revise and add on the sentence to say, "Students can explore the diverse history, cultures, struggles, and politics of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as part of the larger Asian diaspora. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders come from many different countries with varying languages, dialects, customs, and cultural practices." It is important that ethnic studies reflect the diversity of AAPI's extensive history in the United States and do not reinforce harmful and false concepts of an AAPI monolith. Page 23 Line 555: Please revise to say, "This course contends with how the history and experiences of migration, resettlement, and exclusion have intersected with race, gender, and class to shape life in the United States for people of Asian descent." This provides more specificity beyond broad terms of "culture and politics" affecting the identities and experiences of AAPI groups. Noted concepts of Pan-Asianism and transnationalism may be moved to the following paragraph of example topics. Page 35 Line 883: Please revise to say, "...populations into the 1970s and 1980s, and how experiences from the Vietnam War continue to affect Southeast Asian Americans today." Many ongoing challenges experienced by the Southeast Asian American community, including intergenerational trauma and mental health issues, are related to experiences with warfare, genocide, and displacement from the Vietnam War and related events.

Lesson Purpose and Overview: The lesson focuses on the history, politics, culture, contributions, challenges, and current status of Vietnamese Americans in the United States.
Overview: Vietnamese Americans play an integral part in shaping the America's multicultural and multilingual transformation. To understand this process, we must examine the following:
 Vietnamese Refugees: Vietnamese refugee experiences came in waves from 1975 to 1995, including refugees who escaped by boats and/or were repatriated to other countries. There were estimates of up to two million people escaping by boats and approximately half of them perished in the high seas. Many faced hunger, thirst, piracy or other traumatic experiences during their journeys. Many others who were not able to flee remained in Vietnam and faced economic hardships, persecution and re-education camps, and repression from the Communist government. The international community made great efforts to support these coming waves of refugees but exhausted around 1995 when it started to stop accepting these refugees and forced them to return to their homeland. The boat people saga and the hypervisibility of the plight of refugees forced the US, and the international community, to negotiate with Vietnam to allow other waves of Vietnamese leaving through other humanitarian programs under the auspices of family reunification that particularly targeted former political prisoners, Amerasian children, and former employees of the US

government. Most of the refugees were accepted for resettlement to sanctuary countries all over the world, and many resettled in the US The resettling refugees were first scattered all over the US, but most of them eventually congregated around largest concentrations of Vietnamese communities in Orange County, San Jose, Houston, Virginia or Florida.
 New Life in America. Most of Vietnamese refugees arrived in America without any preparation economically, educationally, or culturally. Children were enrolled in schools at their age level with a new language and education system and limited support. Adults were either enrolled in adult schools or began new lives with new job skills or life experiences which were totally different from their normal lives in Vietnam. Many refugees who settled in the US had no proof of certification of their trades or professional careers. They worked in manually laborious jobs that did not require a mastery of the English language. Many Vietnamese children adapted well in American schooling, but their parents or adult relatives were less successful. Overall, they adapted well in their new homeland but the scars of the war, life under community rule, boat escapes, and cultural shock upon arrival in America continued with many of them in varying degrees.
 Vietnamese American Success and Contributions. The Vietnamese have been resettled throughout the US with varying degree of success and California is home to many of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of the Vietnam. In California, there are large Vietnamese American communities in Orange County, San Jose, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco and Sacramento. Vietnamese students make up one of the highest performing groups academically. Among Southeast Asian American ethnic groups, Vietnamese Americans have the highest rate of attaining a higher-education degree. Vietnamese Americans have also made large contributions in high-tech businesses, health care, education, military high-ranking officers or government officials. Despite some successes, the Vietnamese American community continues to have some of the lowest levels of education and income and is one of the most linguistically isolated and Limited English Proficient communities compared to the general population.
Key Terms and Concepts: Vietnamese Americans, Refugees, Oral Histories
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
 Enhance understanding and analyze the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans by engaging in a variety of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, books, documentaries, scholarly articles, community programs and resources;
 Introduce the distinction between refugees, those who seek political and economic refuge as a result of the various wars taken place on Vietnam soil, and immigrants in America seeking opportunity for a better life; and
 Conduct an interview of someone who is a Vietnamese refugee or listen to archived interviews of Vietnamese refugees. Students will develop and ask questions that explore the lived experiences of Vietnamese refugees. Students will record and transcribe the interviews. Students analyze the transcription and create a presentation (using various formats such as PowerPoint, video, paper) on the experiences of Vietnamese refugees.

Essential Questions:
1. What is the history of Vietnamese Americans in the US?
2. How has the cultural perception of Vietnamese people and Vietnamese Americans been shaped and framed by mainstream discourse in the US?
3. How did the first-generation Vietnamese refugees' experiences differ from their children who were born in the US How did their refugee status factor into differing experiences?
4. Why is the Vietnamese American experience important to understand within the context of Asian American studies and US history? What are the differences between the refugee and immigrant experience?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1 �
1. The teacher begins the lesson by asking students, "Tell me one thing about you that shapes your experiences and how you see the world." This provides the students with the opportunity to hear the various perspectives.
a. Students engage in writing "I am From..." poem. Students write a three-stanza poem that speaks to their identity, background, experience, and where they are from. Each line of the poem begins with "I am From..." and should follow something specific about their life, upbringing, and identity. Teachers can provide examples. Allow students 10�15 minutes to write their poem. After everyone has finished writing, students can share their poems in class throughout this lesson.
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Vietnamese Americans and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�4 aloud).
3. The teacher asks students about what they know about Vietnam and its relationship to the United States � "What comes to mind when you think of Vietnam?"
4. The teacher presents some basic information about Vietnamese American history and Vietnamese Americans via article, poem, PowerPoint or other presentation method. Suggested short video clips to share with students are below. Teachers should note that materials may be sensitive for some students.
a. American Experience: Last Days in Vietnam Collection � Refugees: https://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/amex27ldv-soc-flag/last-days-in-vietnam-refugees/
b. PBS Asian Americans Collection - Southeast Asian Refugees: https://ca.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/southeast-asian-refugees/asian-americans/
5. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Vietnamese Americans in the US Alternate choral reading � teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts � Quick Fact Sheet attached.

a. After the watching the videos and reviewing the Quick Fact Sheet, the teacher asks students to draft a set of questions that they would like to learn more about the Vietnamese refugees based on the information provided. Prompting questions may include: "What questions do you have about the refugee experience? What would you like to know more about the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans? Whose story is being told? Whose narrative is being left out?" The class writes down and compiles a list of shared questions.
6. For homework, students can conduct research on the outstanding questions.
Day 2 �
1. The teacher begins a deeper discussion about the Vietnamese refugee experience in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher then shows additional video clips showcasing the diversity of experiences for refugees and their families in the United States. Students are also asked to reflect on how the video clips address how refugees are being portrayed in the context of racism and discrimination in the US. a. PBS WQED Specials � Vietnam: Another View: https://www.pbs.org/video/vietnam-anotherview-libeph/ b. PBS Finding Refuge in KC: Hank - https://www.pbs.org/video/hank-tmh9ae/ c. PBS Borders & Heritage � In Washington, a Vietnamese Refugee Lives Life in Limbo: https://www.pbs.org/video/in-washington-a-vietnamese-refugee-lives-life-in-limbo-i6nbkp/
1. After the video clips, students engage in a Think, Write, Pair/Share followed by Group Share exercise, guided by the following questions:
d. How do Vietnamese Americans describe their refugee experience? How do experiences differ for Vietnamese refugees and their families and children who were raised in the US?
e. How were/are Vietnamese refugees being perceived by both Vietnamese Americans and the American public?
f. How was/is the Vietnamese refugee experience being shaped by racial and discrimination policy and practices in the US?
g. How are the Vietnamese refugee experiences similar to and different from other immigrant groups?
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
 The wars in Southeast Asia have been framed by a general understanding in mainstream discourse of the Vietnam War as a proxy war to a global Cold War between two international superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, as a precursor to discussions surrounding communist/anti-communist political ideological difference and divide that would exacerbate the experiences of resettling Vietnamese later.
 Many Vietnamese refugees experience loss, trauma, and suffering as they flee their homeland and seeking political and economic refuge in a foreign land.

 Being caught between two worlds, Vietnamese American are neither accepted by the country they left behind nor America given their refugee status, a reminder of the war that America played a role in it.
 Vietnamese American community development over the past four decades��its resettlement from refugee camps to recognized ethnic enclaves throughout California and the US.
 The racial inequalities and discriminatory practices to Asian Americans and how they negatively impact the Vietnamese community. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on the racial and socioeconomic disparities that communities of color experience (California Governor's remarks about nail salons as the center of the widespread illness has a negative impact on the industry and its workers).
 Recognize the growth, development, and contributions that many Vietnamese Americans are making to the shape the diversity our America.
Homework/Action/Assessment �
To demonstrate learning of the material, students can choose between two activities to complete as a final homework assignment. The options are:
1. The teacher provides students with a resource list of various articles and short books through the perspective of Vietnamese American refugees. Students are to choose at least three resources and write a 2-page essay answering the reflection questions below.
a. Book: Being Vietnamese in America (Hay Song "My" Mot Cach Rat "Viet Nam") by Nguyen Ha Tran: http://www.fullerton.edu/nrcal/orderbooks_2020.php
b. Book: The Best We Could Do by Thi Bui: http://www.abramsbooks.com/product/best-wecould-do_9781419718779/

g. Article: Asian Americans are still caught in the trap of the model minority stereotype and it creates inequality for all by Viet Thanh Nguyen: https://vietnguyen.info/2020/asianamericans-are-still-caught-in-the-trap-of-the-model-minority-stereotype-and-it-createsinequality-for-all

h. Audio/Podcast: New Books in History � Viet Thanh Nguyen � Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War - https://vietnguyen.info/2020/viet-thanh-nguyen-nothing-ever-diesvietnam-and-the-memory-of-war
Reflection Questions:
i. Viet Thanh Nguyen's book Nothing Ever Dies begins with the statement that `All wars are fought twice: the first time on the battlefield, the second time in memory" � drawing from the chosen articles/books/audio, how might this make sense for in different ways for the first generation of Vietnamese refugees and their second-generation Vietnamese American children?
j. What is it like to be Vietnamese American today? k. How is the identity of Vietnamese Americans being shaped? What is visible and what is
invisible?
2. Students conduct Oral Histories by interviewing Vietnamese refugees using the set of questions that the class has compiled in Day 1, Activity 5 (a) above. Students can also personalize their project by considering how their personal and/or family stories connect to Vietnamese American experience and how the Vietnamese American experience connect to the larger historical narratives and how and why some narratives have been privileged over others. For students who do not have personal/family connections, the teacher should prepare ahead of time to help connect students to Vietnamese American-serving organizations. Lastly, students may consider how to improve their own community, what constructive actions can be taken, and whether they provide a model for change for those in other parts of the state, country, and world.
See: REFUGENE Project "Record Family Stories" Storytelling Kit for oral history resources in partnership with the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations (UNAVSA): https://refugene.com/pages/refugenexunavsa
Students will write a 2-page essay answering each of the guiding questions below and using the evidence from the oral histories collected.
Guiding Questions:
a. How has the refugee experience shaped the identity of Vietnamese Americans? b. What are the stories that were told and what remain invisible?
i. Why did some remain invisible? What conversation topics/themes were more difficult to talk about?
c. What emotions and/or trauma arise from refugees in sharing their experiences? d. How do Vietnamese Americans see themselves in relation to other Asian American
communities? e. What are the hopes and dreams for the next generation of Vietnamese Americans?

Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework
Chapter 14 of the framework includes the civil rights movement of the 1960s which brought attention to the discrimination faced by various ethnic groups after generations of prejudice, discrimination, and discriminatory policies and practices against communities of color (Hispanic farm workers, Native, and Blacks protested against the heavy hand of racism in housing, employment, and educational opportunities). Following this civil rights movement, California's diversity increased only after President Johnson's immigration act of 1965, opening the door to increasingly large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Central America (page 297). Students may analyze the push-and-pull factors that contributed to shifting immigration patterns, but they should also learn about changes in immigration policy (page 299). Two guiding questions for this chapter include: 1) What did protests and frustrations expressed by Californians in the late Cold War Era reveal about the state?; and 2) In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century?

Quick Fact Sheet about Vietnamese Americans in the US
 Vietnamese Americans (Ngi M gc Vit) are make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese (Ngi Vit hi ngoi, also known as Vit Kiu) and are the fourth-largest Asian American ethnic groups after Chinese, Filipino, and Indian Americans.
 The Vietnamese community in the United States was minimal until the South Vietnamese refugees arrived in the US following the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early refugees were refugee boat people who fled political persecution or sought economic opportunities as a result of US involvement on the war in Vietnam.
 More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, primarily their large urban areas. Orange County, California is the home to the largest Vietnamese American population outside of Vietnam.
 As a relatively-recent immigrant group, most Vietnamese Americans are either first or second generation Americans. As many as one million people five years of age and older speak Vietnamese at home, making it the fifth-most-spoken language in the US
 April 30, 1975 marked the fall of Saigon, which ended the Vietnam War, prompted the first largescale wave of immigration; many with close ties to America or the South Vietnam government feared communist reprisals. Most of the first-wave immigrants were well-educated, financially comfortable, and proficient in English.
 From 1978 to mid-1980s marked the second wave of Vietnamese refugees. Political and economic instability under the new communist government led many to escape Vietnam by small, unsafe, crowded fishing boats. The second wave of refugees were generally lower socioeconomically, as most were peasant farmers or fishermen, small-town merchants or former military officials. Survivors were picked up by foreign ships and brought to asylum camps in third countries that agreed to accept them.
 After suffering war and psychological trauma, Vietnamese immigrants had to adapt to a very different culture. Language was the first barrier Vietnamese refugees with limited English proficiency had to overcome. Still today, Vietnamese Americans also have the highest rate of Limited English Proficiency compared to Asian Americans a whole and compared to other racial groups. This adversely affects many socioeconomic outcomes due to poor language access for resources and support.
 Emotional health is still considered an issue common to many Vietnamese refugees, with warrelated loss and the stress of adapting to a different culture leading to mental-health problems among refugees.
