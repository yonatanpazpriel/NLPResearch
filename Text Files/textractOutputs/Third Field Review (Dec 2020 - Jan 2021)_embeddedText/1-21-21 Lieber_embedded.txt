My parents are Holocaust survivors. Is that a price ledge? They came here and worked 15 hour days to reach the American dream. Is that a privilege? Are you priveledged. You must be if you are reading this since that puts you at at least middle class. Include yourself in the privileged class whatever your race or religion is then and see how it feels to become a target of disdain.
