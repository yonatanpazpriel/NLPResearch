From: Vanessa Dekkers Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Racial theory on Jews in our curriculum
I was horrified to read that the curriculum for critical race theory excludes the true history of the Jewish people and the horrors they experienced under Nazism. I am old enough to remember those first pictures we saw at the end of the war of emaciated Jews with sunken eyes dressed in rags as they were released from the concentration camps. I remember as a Christian family in Holland going to the cemeteries not only of the American soldiers row upon row of white headstones marked with American flags but of the mass graves of the Jewish people slaughtered by the Nazis. Even to a small child the reality was horrific. Please teach our true history of World War II of our soldiers in their valiant efforts to rescue the Jewish people so all those people Jewish and Christian alike are never forgotten.
