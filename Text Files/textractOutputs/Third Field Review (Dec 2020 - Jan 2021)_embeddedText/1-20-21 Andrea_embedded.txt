From: Andrea Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:21 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Portrayal of Jews in the new curriculum
There are many problematic issues in the proposed new curriculum with regard to Jews. One of them is that Jews are the only group for whom the term "privilege" is used. The word appears elsewhere, but not attached to any other ethnic group.
The racializing and blame that punctuate the curriculum are more likely to produce further misinformation, hate, anger, and division. If that is where this curriculum is heading, perhaps we are not ready for an ethnic studies program. Until we are, let's not do more damage to our already fractured nation.
