Lesson 33, South Asian Americans in the United States, Appendix A
1) Add the following about the Pittsburgh Tree of Life Synagogue shooting after the lesson on the Oak Creek massacre in Appendix A, after line 8381.
Deadly Shooting at Pittsburgh Synagogue October 27, 2018 Anti-Defamation League (excerpts)
According to police and media reports, Robert Bowers allegedly entered the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh on Saturday morning, yelling, "All Jews Must Die" as he opened fire. As of Saturday evening, the death toll stood at 11, and several people remained hospitalized.
...a social media site frequented by right-wing extremists ï¿½ which appears to belong to Bowers, showcases his virulent anti-Semitism...One of the most recent posts (possibly from Saturday morning), criticizes HIAS, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, which has been instrumental in providing aid to refugees. It also echoes anti-immigration language about hordes of murderous "invaders." "HIAS likes to bring invaders in that kill our people. I can't sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I'm going in."...
Over the last two decades, white supremacists have targeted the Jewish community in the United States via a range of terrorist acts, conspiracy theories and plots. https://www.adl.org/blog/deadly-shooting-at-pittsburgh-synagogue

2) Conforming Changes
Revise Appendix A, line 8132, to read as follows: "3. Printouts of Images (12 pages, one image per group)."
Revise Appendix A, line 8144, to read as follows: "Divide students into 12 groups (ideally of nor more than 2-3 students per group)."
3) Add in Appendix A immediately after line 8385 (glossary):
"Antisemitism: a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"

4) Add in Appendix A immediately after line 8588 (timeline):
2018
A white supremacist entered the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and killed eleven Jewish Americans. Following the synagogue shooting, violent acts of antisemitism targeting Jewish people continued to rise. In 2019, hate crimes targeting Jews in the United States constituted 62.7% of all religiously motivated hate crimes; Jews are 2% of the United States population. African Americans/Blacks and Jews were the first and second most targeted groups that year (2019 FBI "Hate Crime Statistics, https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2019
Reasons for 1-4 Above: This lesson's objective is to "explore instances of discrimination and xenophobia."
It provides examples of bigotry targeting Sikhs, Chinese, Indians, Hindus, Bengalis, Muslims, Middle Easterners, Filipinos, and Pakistanis. It defines Islamophobia and mentions Muslims 5 times.
While this lesson correctly lists people practicing Judaism as South Asian Americans, it does not include acts of discrimination or xenophobia experienced by Jews who immigrated to the United States from that region.
The changes address this omission.
In order for the ESMC to be balanced and avoid bias as required by the State Board of Education's Social Content Standards and ESMC Guidelines, as well as the Education Code, no ethnic or religious groups are to be favored over others.

Lesson 34, Building Empathy, Appendix A
1) Add in Appendix A immediately after line 8381 (glossary):
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DICK DURBIN, A U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
(United States Senate Hearing before the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights of the Committee on the Judiciary, September 19, 2012)
"... Today's hearing is entitled ``Hate Crimes and the Threat of Domestic Extremism.'' ...
Last month, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a white supremacist shot and killed six Sikh worshipers in the Oak Creek Gurdwara.
...In the week following the Oak Creek shooting, there were numerous attacks on mosques, including a mosque being burned to the ground in Joplin, Missouri; a shooting at a mosque in my home State, in Morton Grove, Illinois, while 500 worshipers were praying inside; and an unidentified perpetrator throwing an improvised explosive device at an Islamic school, again in Illinois, in Lombard, during a prayer service. According to the Justice Department, the increase in discrimination against mosques since 2010 ``reflects a regrettable increase in antiMuslim sentiment.''
At the same time, African Americans continue to be targeted by a vast majority of racially motivated hate crimes; Jewish Americans continue to be victims of religiously motivated hate crimes; Latinos are the victims of most ethnically motivated hate crimes; and hundreds of LGBT Americans are the victims of violent hate crimes every single year..."

2) Replace "South Asians and Muslims" with "South Asians" each place it appears in Appendix A (lines 8650 and 8654)
Replace "South Asians, Muslims and Arab Americans" with "South Asians" in Appendix A, line 8660.

Reason: This lesson is about building empathy for South Asian ethnic and religious groups, all captured by the term "South Asians."
In order for the ESMC to be balanced and avoid bias as required by the State Board of Education's Social Content Standards and ESMC Guidelines, as well as the Education Code, no ethnic or religious groups are to be favored over others.
3) Remove all copyrighted materials which CDE does not have permission to publish.
Lesson 35, Xenophobic Racism Against South Asians and Muslims Past and Present, Appendix A
1) Replace "South Asians and Muslims" and "South Asians and/or Muslims" with "South Asians" each place it appears in Appendix A (lines 8834-8835, 8842, 8856, 8867, 8894, 8947 and 9083).
Replace "Arabs and Muslims, and other ethnic communities perceived to be Middle Eastern in the United States" with "communities perceived to be Middle Eastern in the United States."
Reason: This lesson is on racism against South Asian ethnic and religious groups, all captured by the term "South Asians" and "communities perceived to be Middle Eastern" which resulted in racist acts against Sikhs, Hindus, and a Palestinian.
In order for the ESMC to be balanced and avoid bias as required by the State Board of Education's Social Content Standards and ESMC Guidelines, as well as the Education Code, no ethnic or religious groups are to be favored over others.
2) Relating to "Event 1" in Appendix A, lines 9032-9057:
Contact the Los Angeles Times for permission to reprint this 1991 article "Suspicious Fires Probed for Ties to Gulf Tension."
If permission is granted, reprint the entire article, not selective excerpts. Directions can be found here: https://www.latimes.com/about/how-to-obtain-rights-permissions.
If permission is not granted, seek permission to reproduce the article "Jewish Community Unites to Clean After Protests" about 2020 hate crimes against shop owners in the same Los Angeles neighborhood. Contact (323) 933-5518 or Karen@beverlypress.com.
"Jewish Community Unites to Clean After Protests" (June 2, 2020). https://beverlypress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/6.4-issue-1.pdf
Reason: This Los Angeles Times article cannot be reprinted without permission.
The Los Angeles Times article printed in the ESMC is an edited version of the original; removed from the original are "owned by...an Iranian-Jewish immigrant," "Jewish organizations," and "Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith."

These edits -- that deleted references to "Jewish immigrant" and Jewish organizations -do not give the reader a full understanding of what happened in Los Angeles on January 22, 1991. As such the excerpts violate the Los Angeles Times policy which states that "in rare cases we do allow quotes to be used if the use does not alter the original context of the article." https://www.latimes.com/about/how-to-obtain-rights-permissions.
As the article reads in this ESMC draft, the reader is lead to conclude that the attack was an anti-Arab crime, based on a neighbor's supposition that an arsonist believed the store's owner "is of Arab, rather than Jewish, descent" rather than that the arsonist could have targeted the market because the owner is a Jewish Middle Eastern man.
The full article reveals that the fire was at an Iranian-Jewish owned business and quotes representatives of both Arab-American and Jewish organizations deploring hate crimes.
3) Relating to 2009 article "Muslims Teens Push Back" in Appendix A, lies 9058 - 9076:
CDE should determine the appropriateness of a religious-based publisher under the State Board of Education Social Content Standards, ESMC Guidelines and the Education Code.
If appropriate, CDE should obtain reprint rights from Christian Century that allow CDE to omit the subscription information below. CDE's rules bar advertising in the ESMC. See CDE instructions for the ESMC's second field review. Christian Century copyright and permission procedures are here: https://www.christiancentury.org/rights-and-permissions
Note:
Christian Century is focused on Christian-related politics and the Christian church, scripture, and theology. For example, a recent article on its website reported about the popularity of Black Christian Hoodoo (an "ancestral African religion" based on "Black American folk magic") for "Black Christians interested in unpeeling the layers of White supremacy and colonization from their faith."
Christian Century requires all reprinted materials to include "Subscriptions: $65/yr. from P. O. Box 429, Congers, NY 10920ï¿½0429. (800) 208-4097. christiancentury.org."
