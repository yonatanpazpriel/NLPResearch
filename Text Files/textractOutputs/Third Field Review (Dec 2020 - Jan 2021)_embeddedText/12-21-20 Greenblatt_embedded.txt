I have not read your plan to change the curriculum of the California school system. I do know that the left is hell bent on showing that America is a bad country as Obama so eloquently put it in his many speeches. There are so many good things to say as for instance how my immigrant Father from Russia without speaking English was able to raise three children during the depression with no help from the government, or how the Japanese started from scratch after their internment by president Roosevelt and have become the most educated and most financially secure among us. I wish someone in power would bring a curriculum change to properly teach our students arithmetic and the proper use of English. It is because of progressive groups that we have failed our children. If you plan to teach the truth about communism and socialism and how our system has proven superior then that would be a good thing. Racial and ethnic studies should not be highlighted within the historical perspective of our country, so I hope you do not intend to harp on that subject. Yours, richard Greenblatt
