What is happening to our universities in California? Why are those in charge declaring themselves judge and jury when declaring the identities of the Jewish people? A small group of extremists get to decide how thousands of students will be taught? And with a highly negative slant? Why? What is the objective? Please reconsider your horrific plans to disseminate information that is surly at best. Again I ask , why?
Most Sincerely, Rebecca Porter
