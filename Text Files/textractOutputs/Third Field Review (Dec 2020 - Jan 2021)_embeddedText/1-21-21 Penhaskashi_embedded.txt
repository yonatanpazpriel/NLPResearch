From: Davina Penhas Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 10:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
This email is to memorialize my opposition to the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. It is both disingenuous and historically inaccurate to characterize Jewish people as "white" or "people of color" as Judaism is a religion not an ethnicity. It is also a tool of Nazi Germany during the Holocaust and an anti-Semitic trope throughout history. I urge you to revise your reliance on critical race theory in any ethnic studies curriculum.
Sincerely,
Davina Penhaskashi
