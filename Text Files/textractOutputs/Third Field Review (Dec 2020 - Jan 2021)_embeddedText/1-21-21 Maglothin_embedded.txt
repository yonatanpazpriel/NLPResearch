From: Sonja M Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the California State Board of Education,
I urge you to revise your proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum to remove positive references to known antisemitic organizations and propagandizing "conditionally white" Jews as having "privilege". It is disgusting enough that the state of California, facing overwhelming poverty and homelessness, would teach public school students that having white skin amounts to original sin, but to claim that the most vulnerable ethnic group to hate crimes in the United States (according to FBI statistics), a group that within living memory was persecuted with total genocide, a group for whom the United States righteously went to war to save from annihilation, a group for whom pogroms, blood libel, and legal discrimination were constant threats to their lives, has "privilege" just perpetuates the very hate that the Department of Education presumably aims to conquer.
As the last remaining survivors of the Holocaust die off, there has been a global surge in antisemitism and Holocaust denialism. California school children should be girded against this insidious and prolific hatred, not indoctrinated with it. Please consider adopting the recommendations made by Stand With Us, an organization dedicated to fighting antisemitism, found here: https://www.standwithus.com/esmc-analysis-and-revisions
Nearly every generation of Jews for thousands of years has been made unwelcome refugees in every region in the world. Victory over Nazism finally should have brought peace to this beleaguered group of people, yet hate against them continues to fester. Please do your part to ensure the students of California schools are given the tools to combat this moral disease, instead of succumbing to it.
Sincerely, Sonja Maglothin [address redacted] Mulino, OR
