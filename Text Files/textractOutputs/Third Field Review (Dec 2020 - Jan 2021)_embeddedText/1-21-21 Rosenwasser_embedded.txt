From: Penny Rosenwasser Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please Return Arab American Curriculum to Ethnic Studies
To Whom it May Concern:
I'm a white Jewish teacher and Kehilla synagogue member; I've taught an antisemitism / anti-arabism class at City College of San Francisco for 12 years with a Palestinian colleague and I've published an award-winning book about anti-Semitism.
As we just saw on January 6, white nationalism is the main purveyor of U.S. antiSemitism, so I'm especially thankful that the Nazi Holocaust is taught. However criticism of Israel is not anti-semitic.
It's also vital for the Palestinian and Arab narratives to be taught--so that Arab American students see their histories reflected. In my classroom, it's thrilling to watch students learn from hearing Jewish and Palestinian narratives -- they thrive from inclusion and learn to become allies. This is what transformative education is about. Please don't deny them this; please include the Arab American lesson plan submitted by members of the original ESMC advisory committee.
Sincerely,
Penny Rosenwasser, Ph.D.
