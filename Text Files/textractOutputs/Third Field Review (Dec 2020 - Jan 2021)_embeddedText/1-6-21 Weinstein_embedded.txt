Please include Jewish history including the Holocaust & the founding of the current state of Israel, despite the Arab countries' wars & opposition to Israel. There are at least 21 Arab/Muslim countries that could have absorbed Palestinian refugees but chose instead to use the Palestinians as political agitators & a wedge against Israel. Please remove all anti-Israel & pro-BDS propaganda from your ESMC. I don't want my tax dollars spent on mandatory political prejudice & hatred. Thank you. Yours truly, Linda Weinstein.
