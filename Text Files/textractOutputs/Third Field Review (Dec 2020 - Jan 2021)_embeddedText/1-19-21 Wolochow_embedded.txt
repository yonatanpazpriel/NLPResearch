From: M. Wolochow Sent: Sunday, January 17, 2021 12:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Covering Anti-Semitism in the CA Curriculum
Gentlepersons:
By all means, the ethnic groups mentioned in the proposal should be included. But as Jewish Americans who have lived long enough to remember the "Gentleman's Agreement" era, not to mention immigration bans, Naziism and the Holocaust, and the current rise in anti-Semitic rhetoric and even lethal attacks on Jews in the past year, we feel that the subject of Jews in America and the long history of anti-Semitism should play a major role in the new curriculum.
When democratic regimes begin the downward spiral to autocracy and dictatorship, Jews are often the first group targeted, and it is the inaction of others that leads to further downward spiraling. An informed student body will understand this dynamic and oppose it strongly.
Please consider this as you consider completing this vital part of the school curriculum.
Thank you

PS Ironically, Jews were prevented from buying property in our community until the 1960s. When the ban was lifted through efforts of a local nonJewish professor, UCSD medical school began and is now one of the leading medical centers in the country. More people need to know this history, which is not unique to La Jolla, but was commonplace all over the USA.
