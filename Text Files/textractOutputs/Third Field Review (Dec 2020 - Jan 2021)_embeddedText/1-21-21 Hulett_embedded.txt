From: Brenda Hulett Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] STOP Critical Race Theory
I want someone to HEAR ME! Critical race theory is in itself racist and I want everyone to STOP trying to change the country I was born and raised in! If everyone wants to be communists, go to a communist country and leave America the Land of the Free and home of the brave! Along everything about race is abhorrent and completely not ok. I am beyond uncomfortable with what people are allowing to happen and it has to stop. So HEAR ME PLEASE?!
