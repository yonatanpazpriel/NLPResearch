From: Howard Heitner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Sir/Madame:
While I fully support incorporating ethnic studies curriculum into the California curriculum, I find it abhorrent that you would continue to perpetuate lies, stereotypes and distortions by singling out Jewish Americans only for having "white privilege". I lost two-thirds of my family in the ethnic cleansing of the Holocaust. For that I get lumped into a category with no other group of having "white privilege". You should immediately look at the authors' own biases and revise the curriculum so that generations of California children (and possibly other states who emulate California) don't get inculcated into your biased and frankly anti-Semitic curriculum.
Sincerely,
Howard Heitner Resident, Los Angeles County
