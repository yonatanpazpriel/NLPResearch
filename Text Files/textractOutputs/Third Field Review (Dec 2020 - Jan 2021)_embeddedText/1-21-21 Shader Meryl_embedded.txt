From: Meryl Shader Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:23 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies and antisemitism
To whom it may concern:
Please reconsider the proposed curriculum for California's Ethnic Studies course. In its latest form, it perpetuates antisemitic stereotypes and is deeply offensive. We are living in a time in which antisemitism is on the rise, both within our country and around the world; what students are taught should further understanding, not deepen divisions.
Inclusion of the ADL's lesson, BINAH, would improve the course materials, as would the inclusion of the definition of antisemitism by the International Holocause Remembrance Alliance, adopted by the State Department during Obama's administration. Thank you for removing earlier materials with a strong anti-Israel and antisemitic bias.
Sincerely, Meryl Shader Sacramento
