I read your curriculum for Ethnic studies and critical pedagogy and I am.appalled and disgusted that in a free country you are promoting such a racist policy against people based on the color of their skin. I grew up in an America that is a melting pot and gives opportunity to all no matter what the color of your skin or race is. We should be focusing on that not on who has more privilege or not because there are poor, middle class and rich in all ethnicities and gender. Making a child feel bad or guilty for how they were born is appalling. Children do not have a choice in the color of their skin, ethnicity, sex or socioeconomic status they are born in. It is appalling that you would single them out by their race, and religious background. That is racist, demeaning and appealing on so many levels. My children grew up with multictural friends and treat them all equally because we were all created equally. This ideology is dangerous and very unfair to our children. Indoctrination of them at such a young age very damaging and uncalled for. As a child of a victim of bombings in WW2 , this seems eerily like the ethnic teachings of Nazi Germany.. As parents we are entrusting you with our most precious beings, our children whom we love and cherish and teaching children this curriculum is completely wrong. All people of all colors should be proud of who they were born as and not be degraded, or ostracized for it. This type of curriculum sets up white or Christian kids for ridicule, bullying and/or violence from others. I cannot even understand in a free country how this is even become an idea. In America we stand up for each other no matter the race, ethnicity or gender. I implore you with all my heart, soul and mind to put a stop to this dangerous curriculum.
Sincerely,
