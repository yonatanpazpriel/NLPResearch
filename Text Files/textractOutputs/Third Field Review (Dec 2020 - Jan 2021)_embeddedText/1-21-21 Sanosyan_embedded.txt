From: Sanosyan, Armine Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Don't Count Us Out: Armenian-American Studies in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Honorable Members of the CDE,
I write to you today in support of Armenian-American Studies in the ESMC. Our community today is under attack and has been historically marginalized within the United States. We ask you to not continue to marginalize our histories in the curriculum.
Armenian-Americans make up over 1 million people in the United States, with the largest community residing in California. Armenian-Americans have a long history of experiences of marginalization, migration, racialization, refugeehood, surveillance, and lack of equitable access to education, health, and employment in the United States. Many Armenian-American students are immigrants and refugees, or their children, and English Language Learners. They continue to be impacted by a curriculum that marginalizes their histories and needs.
We urge the IQC and the CDE to center Ethnic Studies Scholars and practitioners in the writing of the model curriculum. As a concerned community member, and Armenian-American residing in California, I am calling on you to bring Armenian-American Studies scholars who do work in Ethnic Studies to the table and incorporate Armenian-American Studies in the main curriculum. We as Armenian-Americans believe it is imperative that Armenian-American Studies is included in the main curriculum. After coalitional advocacy work, Armenian-Americans appear now in the appendix, but we continue to be marginalized in the actual model.
Our children deserve to see their histories reflected and uplifted in their classrooms. Our community in the United States and abroad is under attack, and residents of the U.S. must learn about our lives, histories, and issues. Therefore, Armenian-American Studies and all West Asian-American Studies must be included in the ESMC. West Asian-American Studies is AsianAmerican Studies and is part of the next generation of exciting and empowering work within Ethnic Studies.
We ask the CDE to do the following
� Hear the calls of over 6,000 public comments by Armenian-Americans calling for Armenian-Americans Studies to be in the main curriculum
� Write Armenian-American Studies into the ESMC using experts with this specialty who are Ethnic Studies practitioners
� Ground the ESMC in Ethnic Studies guiding principles, grounded in its anti-racist, decolonial purpose

Ethnic Studies helps young students make sense of their realities. Our students deserve, as the ESMC states, "culturally/community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining."
Sincerely,
Armine Sanosyan
