From: Jerry BERKMAN Sent: Friday, January 8, 2021 12:16 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Many people seem to think anti-semitism doesn't exist or is unimportant. But on Jan. 6, at the Capitol in Washington D.C. on January 6, some of the rioters were wearing "Camp Auschwitz - Work Brings Freedom" sweatshirts with a picture of a skull in the center. Clearly anti-semitic. We need a strong module on anti-semitism, and to delete any implicitly anti-semitic statements in the other modules.
