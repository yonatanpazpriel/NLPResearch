From: Alex Friedman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Extensive Concern with the ESMC in schools
I read the model curriculum and other related information regarding ESMC and was horrified to learn about how our kids will be manipulated from kindergarten and onwards to learn about differences versus similarities and common goals / values we share as Americans. Having grown up in a Soviet style dictatorship, this is looking nightmarishly familiar. I urge you to rethink this effort and instead focus on celebrating our cultures as a positive merging into the American culture and melting pot, rather than grievance and shaming based on ethnicity.
Thank you for considering my thoughts!
