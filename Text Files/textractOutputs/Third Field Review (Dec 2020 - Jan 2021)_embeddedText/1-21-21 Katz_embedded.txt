Please do not treat Jews with contempt you would not show to Muslims, Blacks, Arabs or Hispanics. Please do not use language or judge Jews in a way that is different than other minorities. The online comments I have seen from people supporting the ethnic studies model is really reprehensible.
Thank you
Lisa
