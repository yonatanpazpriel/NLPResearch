I just read about the way you are describing Jews in the new Curriculum. Unbelievable. Racist and stupid to say the least. Privileged? Really?? What a privilege to have walked into the gas chambers. Why put more targets on Jewish backs and stoke hatred and resentment for old meaningless tropes. Consult leading Jewish minds and leaders and you will get more representational words. Please.
