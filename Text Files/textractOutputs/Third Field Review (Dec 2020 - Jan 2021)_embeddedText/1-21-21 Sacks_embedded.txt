From: Sharan Sacks Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 5:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
For the first time in my life, I am ashamed of being a Californian, if the current version of the proposed "California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum" is adopted.
In its current form, it perpetuates the anti-Semitic narratives used throughout history:
- It promotes the "us" versus "them" ideology.
- It celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism.
- It promotes the conspiracy theory depicting Jews as impostors and appropriators of priviledge for being white.
- It emphasizes Jews hiding their Jewishness by changing their names [as if other ethnic groups didn't change their names].
- It ignores any discussion of the bloody history of oppression of Jews throughout the centuries.
- It counts Jews, who make up 0.2% of the world's population and 2% of the U.S. population, as members of an evil class.
I sincerely hope that California, the state that I love, is not trying to become 1933 Nazi Germany. The "Ethnic Studies Model" seems to indicate that it is.
