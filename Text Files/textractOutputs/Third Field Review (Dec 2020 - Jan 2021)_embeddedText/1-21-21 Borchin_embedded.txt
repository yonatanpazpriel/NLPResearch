From: Christie Borchin Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed curriculum
This is a in response to the proposed model curriculum where public comments end today. First of all, how can you all in effect change history? You are doing just that by altering the current curriculum.
Excluded from California's model curriculum are the white ethnic groups (Italians, Irish, Poles and so forth) studied fruitfully by scholars such as Nathan Glazer, Daniel P. Moynihan and Michael Novak. Also largely excluded are groups like Jews and Armenians who were persecuted abroad and sought refuge in America. The groups that dominate the curriculum are AfricanAmericans, Latinos, Asian-Americans and American Indians.
By focusing on these four and treating them solely as victims, the curriculum misses the opportunity to convey to students that groups at the bottom of the social and economic ladder can climb, making use of their cultural assets and the opportunities the country affords them. This curriculum teaches the opposite. It attaches moral opprobrium to success by instructing teachers and students that the Jews and Irish in America have secured white "racial privilege.
Your proposed changes are insensitive to all.
Thank you!
