From: Kishan D Lara-Cooper Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 3:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Third Field Review
Greetings, Thank you for your hard work and dedication to developing this third draft of the ESMC. I appreciate the opportunity to provide the feedback below: Chapter 1: Introduction and Overview * Consider adding to line 19 - Ethnic Studies assists children in developing a multilogical lens whereby students are exposed to diverse perspectives and multiple truths. Through this process, students' sense of identity, agency and academic motivation are heightened.
* Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a phenomenal example. However, if you wanted to include a California author, you could incorporate the concept of Testimonial Justice by LaraCooper in Chapter 2 of Ka'm-t'em: A Journey Toward Healing. Chapter 3: Instructional Guidance for K-12 Education *Line 572- In many scholarly articles "Indigenous" is always uppercase. Although "Indigenous" references Indigenous peoples beyond the US, it should be noted that many scholars utilize "Indigenous" to refer to Indigenous peoples of the United States. This section may need to clarify this.
*Line 581-590- Consider including "language" or "language revitalization". Not only is this a component of Ethnic Studies but it has an integral historical and cultural context in Indigenous communities.

* Line 889- Include a specific focus on California. California has a very unique history in comparison to the rest of the country. For example, in some places "contact" was three and half centuries later. Perhaps in line 891, a phrase like "California Indian history, the Indian Removal Act of 1830, etc."
*Line 892- Consider changing the word "migration" to "relocation" or "removal"
*Line 1007- The reference to Mni Wiconi is a great example! However, please consider including local Indigenous social movements such as language revitalization, cultural renewal, dam removal, environmental advocacy, etc. It is critical that citizens of California understand that social movements and advocacy are happening right here in California. Bibliography Consider including California Indigenous texts in the bibliography. Once again, it is critical in ethnic studies to embrace testimonial justice- an opportunity for each group to tell their own story, their own perspective, and their own truth. This can only be done if we are recommending texts that are written by the people themselves. For California Indigenous (Native American) Studies, I would recommend:
