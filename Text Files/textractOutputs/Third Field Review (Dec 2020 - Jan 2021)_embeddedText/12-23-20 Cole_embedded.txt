Dear State Board of Education --
I appreciate various changes made to an earlier version of the curriculum.
But the curriculum needs to include a lesson plan on antisemitism and a definition of this awful and still alive form of hatred. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition is an excellent example. The U.S. State Department has used this definition since 2010, along with the European Union and others. See www.state.gov/defining-anti-semitism.
I also urge you to include a statement along the lines of Los Angeles Unified School District's "Elements of a Balanced Curriculum":
"At the college and university level, ethnic studies and related courses are sometimes taught from a specific political point of view or frame of reference. In K-12 education it is imperative that students are exposed to multiple perspectives, taught to think critically and form their own opinions on these and other issues."
Thank you for your attention and for continuing to improve the curriculum to assure our students never receive antisemitic indoctrination, sometimes in the guise of anti-Israel rhetoric or rejection of Jewish aspirations of self-determination, and always will be taught the danger of antisemitism for everyone and the need to stop it.
