Dear Board of Education:
Clearly it is a very challenging task to create and train teachers to implement an Ethnic Studies curriculum that challenges assumptions and existing power structures while positively motivating and enlightening students. I support your herculean and conscientious efforts here.
At the same time, I would ask for caution in choosing tactics that might veer into bullying, harassment, and challenges to self esteem that can have significant harmful emotional and mental health consequences for youth. As you are undoubtedly aware, programs with some similar goals (such as "Anytown") have been criticized and even abandoned after their negative impacts on participants has been documented.
I would also wonder how feasible it will be to train teachers across the State to offer such a sensitive curriculum with sufficient attention and skill to offer both the factual and emotional content and address the potential fallout.
