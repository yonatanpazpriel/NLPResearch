From: Dolores Womack Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:55 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] FEEDBACK ON MANDATORY ETHINIC STUDIES FOR CALIFORNIA
To Whom It May Concern, I am very concerned with the California curriculum excluding any groups! In this case you have excluded Italians, Irish, Poles and others. Why do we continue to use race as a way to divide people in California and across America? Why are we picking winners and losers? If we do not teach young people that they can succeed in life even if they fail, they can get back up and accomplish anything they want to in life. Teach them the value of hard work! Teach them to love our country, we are "one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all."
Stop dividing us and turning us against each other by creating different classes!
Sincerely, Dolores Williams
