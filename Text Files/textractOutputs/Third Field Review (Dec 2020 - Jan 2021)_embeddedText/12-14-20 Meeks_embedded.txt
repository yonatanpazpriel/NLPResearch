As a young, black college student, I can say that the new model currently drafted for the Ethnic Studies curriculum appears to cover most of the errors of the last draft. However, I have an issue with what the ethnic background of the instructors that are teaching the course would be. In Chapter 2 of the Third Field Review Draft, it is stated that one method that districts may use to "support the development and implementation of a kindergarten through grade twelve (Kï¿½12) ethnic studies program," is to "identify teachers who are willing and committed to invest in developing an ethnic studies curriculum and pedagogy. Administrators should work within the district and site departments to identify teachers with backgrounds in ethnic studies or strong interest in teaching in the area, who will be involved in the development and implementation of the program." In my opinion, it is in the best interest of the districts and the students that districts not only search for teachers with "backgrounds in ethnic studies" or a "strong interest in teaching in the area," but that they also be a part of the four foundational disciplines or one of the overlapping/intersecting identities that they are teaching. For example, if an African American Studies class is implemented, the instructor/teacher of that class SHOULD be an individual of African American heritage; if a Native American class is implemented the instructor/teacher of that class SHOULD be an individual of Native American heritage, etc. For classes in General Ethnic Studies, the teacher should be from one of the four disciplines and/or an overlapping/intersecting identity. If the point of these classes is to "[affirm] the identities and contributions of marginalized groups in our society" then it only makes sense to have the instructors be from the marginalized communities they are teaching to the students. Instructors from non-marginalized communities SHOULD NOT instruct students on the information regarding ANY marginalized community as it is/was not them/their ancestors that experienced the various topics stated in the lessons. Students tend to learn better when the instructor can offer first-hand experience and can relate to the topics.
