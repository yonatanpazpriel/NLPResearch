From: Marvin G. Burns Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Model Curriculum
I vehemently object to your discussion about and characterization of Jews in you proposed model curriculum. I request that you extend the comment time and allow further publication of your proposal so as to gain more input. As it stands your model is a typical anti-sematic trope that will incur the wrath of the sizable Jewish community in this state.
