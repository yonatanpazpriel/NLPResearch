Dear Ethnic Studies,
I was raised Jewish in Saratoga Springs, (upstate) New York, I was 16 before I tasted an avocado.
I happen to love avocados.
I mostly knew only white people in my hometown. I was 1 of 7 Jews in my class of 500. I realize now that we learned next to nothing about Jews or Blacks or Chinese or Indians or LGBT+ etc. When I went to college, I was excited to meet people from all ethnicities. I was raised to think of all humans as equal, but I had little opportunity to meet people from different cultures. It was like that avocado. Something that was there all along, that I didn't know about first hand.
Later, I enrolled in a college course about hispanic ethnic studies and I toured the mural alleys of the San Francisco Mission District and heard the history of Mexican Americans. The excitement of learning not only about my own culture but also about how other cultures lived was almost as exciting as watching a movie about people living on other planets. Children need to be excited by learning, and discovering things that have been there all along will ignite that. Let's embrace teaching children about heroic women and men throughout time and throughout the planet. This starts with you, the person reading this.

Do all you can in your power to insure that truth and love and diversity are taught, and I promise you will enjoy your avocado toast even more in the future.
thanks for your time, Michael Metzger
