From: Gabriela LeMay Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 11:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment regarding the High School Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
California students deserve Ethnic Studies that does not water down the impact of race on people of color. Please maintain all the lesson plans which concerned Californians have contributed and allow local teachers the choice of including what best meets the needs of their students. Please do not give into the organized right wing attack on what they call Critical Ethnic Studies.
