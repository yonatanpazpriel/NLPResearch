From: Phil Wagner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews Have Until Thursday to Influence Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
The article below was just brought to my attention has me concerned as an American Jewish adult. Please reconsider your position on the use of the word privileged in relation to a Jewish person.
Where I do not have the full context, the points raised in the article seem highly inappropriate for a curriculum. Ideally, the curriculum would be amended to something that does not smatter on anti-Semitic. We really don't need this being in taught to young minds or any minds for that matter.
Thank you,
