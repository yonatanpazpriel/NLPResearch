Hello, I would like to voice my opinion about ethnic studies, specifically the `critical race theory' part. This concept is divisive, dividing folks into groups based on the color of their skin, I do not agree with this. While I appreciate and agree with including all historically significant people in our study of American culture, the instructional guidance to promote grouping people by race is not okay with me. In addition, I do not agree with teaching that our country is systemically racist. For heaven's sake, over 600,000 people died fighting for the abolition of slavery and we have been on a path of change for the better as far as racism since the 1700's. Thank God for that. While we aren't perfect, we should be united in this endeavor to argue against dividing us. We are all Americans, I believe more courses should be offered regarding what makes us culturally cohesive. United we stand, divided we fall. Thank you, JeanL. Rollins
