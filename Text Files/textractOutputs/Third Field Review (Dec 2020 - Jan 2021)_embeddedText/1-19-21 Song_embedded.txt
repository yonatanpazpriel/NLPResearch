Good Evening,
Please educated our kids not doctrined our kids. They should be critical thinkers based on full information not biased one.
We support education that addresses racism, develops civic responsibility, and helps our students to build the 21st century skills that they need to succeed in school, work, and life.
However, the third and final draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) is out and it continues to be based on critical race theory, a "radical,"* discriminatory, and highly controversial theory. According to critical race theory scholars in the ESMC, critical race theory rejects equal opportunity, neutrality, and objectivity. It divides our students by race, then labels them as "oppressed" or "oppressors" based on the color of their skin. Rather than recognizing individual attributes or character, students are assigned inherent blame and bias simply because of how they were born. By definition, this is discrimination and bigotry.
Please save kids and save America!
Best regards,
