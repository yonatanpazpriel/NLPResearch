Dear Committee Member-
After reviewing your proposed curriculum You are mandating the state school system teach antisemitism and therefore racism to ever student. You are teaching not that everyone is equal and due respect and civility, but rather it is necessary to identify and denigrate different ethnic groups based on a biased reading of history. .... why would I ever want to move to California? Why would I even want to do business with California companies if I had the choice of alternate suppliers?
And if that is really represents your attitude, why are you surprised you have hate groups throughout your State?
