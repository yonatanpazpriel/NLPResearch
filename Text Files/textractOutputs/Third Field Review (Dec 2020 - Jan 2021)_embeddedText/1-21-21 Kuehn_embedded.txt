Dear Department of Education,
To begin, I wanted to applaud your effort to increase awareness of diversity in the United States. As we face an increasingly global economy and diverse world, it is imperative that we grow in our awareness of culture differences.
However, as I review the prospective curriculum as presented in the final field review, l have my concerns and reservations. I believe some parts of the proposed curriculum is unduly presenting information that can create fear especially in younger students if not presented well. At their young age, immersing them in this much fear can negatively impact their psychological development.
To reiterate, I believe your new curriculum misses the mark in increasing cultural awareness and diversity. It is filled with too much language that will inspire fear and hatred towards certain demographics and sow disunity in a nation that needs more open mindedness towards all people now more than ever. We instead need a curriculum based on objective facts instead of based on sensationalism, one that celebrates the achievements of people who succeeded despite the odds. I implore you to reconsider presenting this curriculum to our impressionable and crucial younger generation, on whom rest the hopes of our nation's future, and instead teach them how to respect all people and ideas rather than increasing fear and hatred towards certain people and ideas.
Thank you for your time and consideration in hearing the opinions of the American people and the general public.
