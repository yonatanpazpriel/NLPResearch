We need curriculum to teach respect for all, and how to have constructive discussions with each other. This curriculum has pitted ethnic groups against each other from the beginning, and now no one is happy. Despite the time and energy invested, it seems the foundational approach was wrong, and I think the best thing to do is to scrap it all and start again. Let's find a different approach that will encourage students from all backgrounds to feel proud of their heritage and history and to engage in learning along with other students in an honest and respectful way. Sincerely, Judtih Mendelsohn
