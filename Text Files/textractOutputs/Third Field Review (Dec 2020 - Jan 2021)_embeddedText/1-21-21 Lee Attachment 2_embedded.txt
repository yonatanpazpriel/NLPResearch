Note: Throughout, this appendix links to various materials and resources for local educational agencies' and educators' consideration. Some of these materials may espouse the particular author's/publisher's own political views, and some others are situated within a broader website or library. The SBE, IQC and CDE do not necessarily endorse all of the espoused views or materials found elsewhere within the broader sites. Local agencies and educators should review all content for appropriateness with respect to use in classrooms.
Ethnic studies is a class for all students. The model curriculum focuses on the four ethnic groups that are at the core of the ethnic studies field. At the same time, this course, through its overarching study of the process and impact of the marginalization resulting from systems of power, is relevant and important for students of all backgrounds. By affirming the identities and contributions of marginalized groups in our society, ethnic studies helps students see themselves and each other as part of the narrative of the United States. Importantly, this helps students see themselves as active agents in the interethnic bridge-building process we call American life.
This appendix provides specific lesson plans to support educators as they explore the four primary themes of the model curriculum:
 Identity  History and Movement  Systems of Power  Social Movements and Equity
As this progression of themes suggests, in ethnic studies it is crucial to focus not only on understanding oppression and fostering compassion, but also on student agency. This begins

Commented [1]: It may be important to note again that the ESMC is meant as a starting point, and not currently robust or comprehensive. Ethnic Studies for K-12 is in its nascent stages. These sample lessons are starting points. For example, some sections such as the AAPI section are significantly longer than others, such as the Native American studies. Hopefully, the state would help curate and incorporate more promising curricula from local districts to build out more of these disciplines.

with each teacher seeing the assets and strengths every student brings to the classroom. Students should leave an ethnic studies class knowing their choices matter and compelled to think carefully about the decisions they make, realizing that their choices will ultimately shape the world.
Fostering Democratic Classrooms
One way for ethnic studies teachers to ensure that their courses affirm and value the identities of all of their students is to engage in the process of fostering democratic and empowering classroom learning communities. In such a classroom, students whose voices have not been heard can grow in understanding and agency, while students from the diversity of social, personal, and academic backgrounds that live together in California are able to participate in the conversation from their personal and community perspectives. Such a learning environment provides a powerful foundation and model for students' future civic participation.
Ethnic studies teachers cultivate in their students the skills and dispositions for effective civic participation by using teaching techniques that create a sense of trust and openness, encourage students to speak and listen to each other, make space and time for silent reflection, offer multiple avenues for participation and learning, and help students appreciate the points of view, talents, and contributions of all members.
By prioritizing student-centered approaches and using a wide variety of discussion protocols, teachers can provide opportunities for students to engage critically in the gray areas of controversial topics, delving into the nuance and complexity of human history. These techniques and strategies are equally important in classrooms where there is relative social, personal, and/or political homogeneity, which present their own challenges in facilitating honest dialogue. Many teachers of such classes also seek out opportunities for their students to engage with counterparts of very different backgrounds. These lessons will help.
The following sample lessons are aligned to the to the ethnic studies values, principles, and outcomes from chapter 1 and the state-adopted content standards in history�social science, English language arts and literacy, and English language development. As a reminder, the values and principles are:

1. cultivate empathy, community actualization, cultural perpetuity, self-worth, selfdetermination, and the holistic well-being of all participants, especially Native People/s and Black Indigenous People of Color (BIPOC);
2. celebrate and honor Native People/s of the land and communities of Black Indigenous People of Color by providing a space to share their stories of success, community collaboration, and solidarity, along with their intellectual and cultural wealth;
3. center and place high value on thepre-colonial, ancestralknowledge, narratives, and communal experiences of Native people/s and people of color and groups that are typically marginalized in society;
4. critique empire-building in history and its relationship to white supremacy, racism and other formsof power and oppression;
5. challenge racist, bigoted, discriminatory, imperialist/colonial beliefs and practices on multiple levels;
6. connect ourselves to past and contemporary social movements that struggle for social justice and an equitable and democratic society; and conceptualize, imagine, and build new possibilities for a post-racist, post-systemic racism society that promotes collective narratives of transformative resistance, critical hope, and radical healing.
The lessons are sorted by disciplinary area and categorized around the sample themes (Identity, System of Power, Social Movements and Equity, and History and Movement) described in chapter 3, although many of the lessons fit with more than one theme. And while each lesson is placed within one or more disciplinary areas of ethnic studies, many can be adapted to cover other groups.
Each of the sample lessons provided in this appendix is organized around a number of essential questions that guide and direct student inquiry. Here are some additional questions that can guide exploration of the guiding themes from chapter 1. These questions are intended to help spark discussion and student reflection, and are not an exhaustive list.
Guiding Outcome 1: Pursuit of Justice and Equity

1. What is justice? What is injustice? How do people's cultures, experiences, and histories influence how they understand and apply these terms?
2. What is equity? How is equity different from equality?
3. How have individual and collective efforts challenged and overcome inequality and discriminatory treatment?
4. How can individuals or groups of people overcome and dismantle systemic discrimination and marginalization, including systemic racism?
Guiding Outcome 2: Working Toward Greater Inclusivity
1. What does it mean to be inclusive? How is inclusivity achieved? What barriers to inclusivity exist?
2. What does it mean to be marginalized? What does that look like? What does that feel like?
3. Whose voices or perspectives have been historically emphasized when studying this topic/event? Whose voices or perspectives have been historically silenced or marginalized?
4. How have those groups attempted to make themselves heard? To what extent have these attempts been successful?
Guiding Outcome 3: Furthering Self-Understanding
1. What does ethnicity mean? What does race mean? What is the difference between ethnicity and race?
2. How are our identities formed? To what extent can a person's identity change over time? To what extent do our own upbringing and culture instill bias?

2. What does it mean to show respect for others? What does that look like? 3. What do we need to be able to do to hear perspectives and experiences that are different from ours? How do we effectively engage with opposing or unfamiliar views as part of exercising civil discourse? Guiding Outcome 5: Recognizing Intersectionality 1. What is intersectionality? Why is it important to recognize and understand intersectionality? 2. Beyond ethnicity, what other kinds of social groups exist? How are these social groups formed and defined? 3. How is intersectionality related to identity? 4. How is intersectionality related to systemic discrimination, racism, and marginalization? Guiding Outcome 6: Promoting Self-Empowerment for Civic Engagement 1. What is civic engagement? What does civic engagement look like? 2. How can civic engagement lead to or contribute to social change? Guiding Outcome 7: Supporting a Community Focus 1. How have different ethnic groups contributed to your community? 2.

2. What are some strategies for effectively and respectfully discussing difficult, sensitive, or controversial topics? 3. In what ways are discussions and debates similar? In what ways are they different? What purposes do these two methods of communication serve? 4. How can we model and foster empathetic listening skills?
General Ethnic Studies
Sample Lesson 1: Migration Stories and Oral History
Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 3, 6 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 6 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a Lesson Purpose and Overview: As part of a larger unit on migration, this lesson guides students to explore their personal stories around how migration has impacted their families. The students will learn about how their own family migration stories connect to their local history. Key Terms and Concepts: oral history, migration, interviewing, archive, memory Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

1. Conduct oral history interviews, transcribe narratives, develop research questions, and build upon interpersonal communication skills
2. Learn from each other by being exposed to the unique migration stories of their peers 3. Strengthen their public speaking skills through interviewing and presenting their research
findings.
Essential Questions:
1. How does your family and/or community's story connect to your local history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Develop an electronic visual presentation for the lesson opening that highlights several major waves of migration (both voluntary and forced). The slides should also include data on migration to the local community and racial and ethnic demographics.
2. Introduce the oral history project to the students by letting them know that they will have an opportunity to learn more about their family's and/or community's migration histories. Task each student with interviewing one family member (preferably an elder) and one community member. The interviews will focus on the interviewee's migration stories, childhood, and memory of the city. The interviews should also seek opinions on how changes in policy, institutions, and community attitudes could (have) improve(d) the interviewee's experience. You may want to show a clip of an interview from a digital oral history archive (see recommended sources for examples) to provide students an example. Teachers should be sensitive to varying family dynamics and have alternative assignments or activities for students that may have difficulty identifying a family member.
3. After introducing the project, provide an overview of the mechanics of oral history. Discuss the types of equipment and materials students will need (an audio or video recording device or application, and field notebook); help students come up with questions, discussing the differences between closed and open-ended questions; and begin to introduce transcribing.
4. During the next few class sessions, allow students to engage in peer-interviewing. Students should conduct mini oral history interviews (no more than seven to ten minutes) with each other. After each interview, give students time to reflect on the

interviewing process, what they learned, memory, and storytelling. Using the "think, pair, share" method, have students write their own reactions to the interviewing process on a sheet of paper, then have them share it with a peer, and finally to the larger class. Alternatively, students can add their ideas to a whole-group virtual discussion board, write their ideas on a slip of paper as an exit ticket or as a warm up to prepare students for a whole-class discussion at the beginning of the next class period.
� If students have access to headsets and computers in the classroom or nearby, they can use the remaining time to practice transcribing their mini-oral history interviews. After two to three mock oral history interviews with their peers, students should be prepared to carry out their own full interviews with a family elder and community member.
5. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a thirty-minute oral history interview with their interviewees, and transcribe at least one interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for copies of old pictures, images of relics that hold some significant meaning or value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.
6. After completing the interview and transcribing, students take excerpts from the interview, as well as pictures or other primary sources they may have from their interviewee, and create a three to five minute presentation (either a video, electronic visual presentation, Prezi, or poster board) discussing their interviewee's migration story, connection to the city, and a brief reflection on their experience conducting the interview. Students are allotted three days to work on their presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an opportunity to practice their presentations with peer to peer and peer to small group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.
7. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations, students in the audience should be active listeners, taking notes, and asking follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using "the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.

8. As part of the culmination of this project, using these guiding questions students make the broader connection of all migration stories represented in the classroom.
� How are our migration stories similar?
� How are they different?
� How does knowing the shared migration stories of your peers impact how we relate to one another?
9. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by coordinating a community presentation event.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Peer assessments are used to help students refine their oral history presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the practice groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having difficulty with the assignment.
 During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students' presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.
 Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student presenters.

Sample Lesson 2: Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement
Theme: Social Movements and Equity
Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 2, 5, 6
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1; Historical Interpretation 1, 3, 4
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 8; WHST.9�10. 1, 2, 4, 7
CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 2, 6a, 6c, 11
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This primary source analysis assignment turns students into researchers, while simultaneously allowing the students to orient themselves with the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement, and contemporary social movements.
The purpose of the lesson is for students to learn, analyze and discuss current social movements happening both in the United States and abroad. By learning about past and present social movements students will learn first-hand how communities of color have resisted and fought for their human rights and self-determination.
Key Terms and Concepts: social movement, The Third World Liberation Front, solidarity
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. Conduct a primary source analysis in relation to social movements and the development of ethnic studies
2. Consider how social movements emerge, understand tactics employed, and identify their overall contributions/impact to society
3. Engage in critical analysis, learn to decipher credible and non-credible sources, further develop public speaking skills, and work collaboratively

Essential Questions:
1. What causes social movements?
2. What strategies and tactics are most effective within social movements? What gives rise to the proposals and demands of social movements?
3. What impact have past and present social movements had on society? Why might people have different responses to social movements? What social movements exist today?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Begin the lesson by defining what social movements are and how they start. Introduce the history of the Ethnic Studies Movement and the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) strike to students. Include in the introduction/overview pictures and brief video clips of San Francisco State College students protesting. Throughout the overview, highlight that the Ethnic Studies Movement was successful due to unity and solidarity building, as well as drawing on momentum from other movements that were happening simultaneously, like, the Black Power, American Indian, Anti-war, Asian American, Chicano, United Farm Workers, and Women's Liberation movements.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework includes an extensive section on the Civil Rights Movement and other movements that fought for social change (beginning on page 414). As part of their research for this ethnic studies lesson, teachers may also ask students to reflect upon past movements and how these modern-day social movements build upon the accomplishments and limitations of those who came before.
2. Divide students into pairs, providing each group with two primary source documents including:
a. The original demands of the TWLF
b. Student proposals for Black, Asian American, Chicano, and Native American studies
c. Images from the strike

d. Speeches and correspondence written by San Francisco State College administrators concerning the TWLF strike
e. Student and Black Panther Party newspaper clippings featuring articles about the TWLF strike
3. Introduce each of the materials, providing a small amount of context, and a brief overview of what is a primary source. Instruct each pair to read each document carefully, conduct additional research to better contextualize and situate the source within the history of this period, and to complete a primary source analysis worksheet for each source (see below).
4. Provide students with class time to work on this assignment. They should also have an opportunity to work on the assignment as homework.
5. After completing the primary source worksheet, each group is paired with another group where they share their primary source analyses with each other. The groups are also tasked with finding themes, commonalities, connections or discrepancies/conflicts between their four sources while exploring their perspective and points of view.
6. Ask each group to write on a large piece of paper/poster board what they believed were the key tactics/strategies, vision, and goals of the TWLF movement based on their research findings. They can also decorate the poster board with pictures, a copy of their primary source, and other materials.
7. While still in groups of four, assign each group a contemporary social movement. Alternatively, the students can work with the teacher to select the movement that they wish to research.
8. Let each group of four know that they are now responsible for completing the two previous assignments (primary source analysis and poster board) with their new social movement. Students are to identify two primary sources on the movement, conduct research (including a review of secondary sources like credible news articles, scholarly research, interviews, informational videos, etc.), and complete the primary source analysis worksheet. They are also to complete a poster board displaying the goals, vision, and tactics/strategies of their assigned contemporary social movement.

9. At the end of the unit, each group presents their poster board and social movement to their peers. After all group presentations have been completed, students will have an opportunity to have a class discussion around the impact of social movements. The class will ultimately return back to the original guiding questions for the lesson.

Sample Lesson 3: Youth-led Participatory Action Research (YPAR)

Theme: Multiple
Disciplinary Area: All disciplinary areas
Youth-led Participatory Action Research
Getting students to engage primary sources, develop youth-participatory action research (Youth-led Participatory Action Research [YPAR)) projects, or create service-learning projects are just a few examples of how an inquiry-based approach encourages students to become engaged actors within the learning process. Youth Participatory Action Research provides young people with opportunities to study social problems affecting their lives and then determine actions to rectify these problems. (Dimitriadis 2008). Students will take what they learned in earlier units to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem identified, for its culminating unit. This YPAR project has a guided process that allows the students then to use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they have studied.
A course can utilize an ethnic studies framework based on the goal of deepening students' understanding of both the past and the present through continual reflection on the interaction between the two. Students learn to shift analytical lenses between their personal lives and the larger social and historical context that has created the environment within which they live. This process deepens students' understanding of themselves by grounding it in history and it deepens their appreciation of history by connecting it to their contemporary lives.
This dynamic can be demonstrated with a specific focus on a particular subgroup, such as Asian Americans. Each unit is constructed to build upon the previous unit. Each unit draws from primary documents, students' personal experiences, community and/or family members' experiences, and scholarly essays. Each of these sources come together to value knowledge that goes beyond what is published in history textbooks.
The culminating project for the course also requires students to employ both their personal, contemporary analytical lens and their historical analytical lens. Students work in teams to develop lessons based on the content of their Ethnic Studies course and teach the lessons to students at middle and/or elementary schools in their communities. Lesson development emphasizes the connections that the high school students must find between the historical material and the lives of the middle school students in order to assure the success of the

lessons. Student writing is the principal form of assessment in this course. Short in-class or homework writing assignments provide formative assessment of daily activities, and the collection of writing assignments outlined above provides a summative assessment for each unit.
In addition, oral presentations are used to assess student learning, as in Unit 1 (sharing the document box), Unit 3 (performance of a five-minute play), Unit 4 (teaching project), Unit 6 (oral history project). Most units include a project by which student work is assessed. Unit 4 features a teaching project. Students should be taking what they learned in the first semester (Units 1�3) and develop a lesson plan on a specific topic within the subgroup focus. They will teach the lesson plan to a nearby middle or elementary school. They will be taught how to do the research to develop a well-structured lesson plan with interactive exercises that will engage the students in the class that they are teaching in. The lesson plan must draw from the concepts presented in Units 1�3. This becomes that major assessment for semester 1.
Ultimately, the main assessment will be the outcome of the Youth Participatory Action Research Project where both writing and oral skills will be tested. Students will take what they learned in Units 1�7 to do a college preparatory research project that utilizes sound methodology to study a problem in the identified subgroup community. This YPAR project has a guided process that allows the students then use their research to develop an action plan to address the problems that they studied. The writing assignments described below are produced through a writer's workshop process that includes structured brainstorming activities, multiple drafts, peer editing, and publication within the classroom or school.
The following shows how each term in YPAR is operationalized.
YOUTH: Young people between the ages of 14 and 24.
PARTICIPATORY: All participants, including youth, are seen as experts who all have important experiences and knowledge.
ACTION: The goal is to use what youth research to develop a plan of action toward bettering their communities.
RESEARCH: A systematic investigation of a problem facing youth.

This course implements culturally and community responsive pedagogy by focusing on marginalized histories that are often neglected in mainstream history courses and connecting them to community issues that need to be addressed. Gay (2000) defines culturally responsive teaching as using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, and performance styles of diverse students to make learning more appropriate and effective for them; it teaches to and through the strengths of these students. Gay (2000) also describes culturally responsive teaching as having these characteristics:
Culturally Responsive Pedagogy Course Implementation:
� It acknowledges the legitimacy of the cultural heritages of different ethnic groups, both as legacies that affect students' dispositions, attitudes, and approaches to learning and as worthy content to be taught in the formal curriculum.
� The course would look at the diversity amongst one marginalized subgroup but also the collective experiences impacted by racism. This is evidenced to the use of primary sources.
� It builds bridges of meaningfulness between home and school experiences as well as between academic abstractions and lived sociocultural realities.
Sample Lesson 4: Introducing Narratives
To understand dominant narratives about ethnic groups, students must first grasp the concept of a narrative. A narrative is an account of an event or series of events, usually in the form of a story.
The story that is told shapes how a person views, or forms an opinion about, the event behind the story.
Consider how "conservative" and "liberal" news outlets, for example, often cover the same event but tell completely different stories about it. Depending on which news outlet you read/watch/listen to, you will form an opinion about an event that will vary slightly or greatly from one news outlet to the next. This is because the story that is being told will vary depending on who is telling the story and how they interpret the event. The story told will

differ from one source to another in what different storytellers choose to highlight and in whom and what they include and whom and what they leave out.

This lesson introduces students to how narratives are formed about events or a people by probing the sources of narratives in two ways: a) identifying who the storyteller is, their prior or preconceived knowledge of the event or person, the assumptions they make, and their personal biases; and b) how different storytellers have interpreted the events or people they're talking about in what they've selected to feature and highlight in the story and what they've chosen to leave out.

Reflection Worksheet for homework (p. 4)

Preparation:



Tailor a list of discussion questions for class.



Make copies of the Reflection Worksheet for homework (one per student).

In-Class Activities:

1. Activate Prior Knowledge��Write the following questions on the board and ask students to write down their answers independently. Explain to students that you will revisit their answers to these questions at the end of class.



What does the word "narrative" mean to you?



Where do we get information from?



How do we form opinions about events or a people?



Do other people's opinions in narratives influence our behavior?

2. Comparing Narratives Partner Activity��Pair each student with a classmate. Within each pair, one student will write an autobiography and the other student will write a biography of their partner. Give the pairs 15 minutes to write independently. Once students are done writing, ask each partner to read what they wrote to their partner. Write the following questions on the board, and ask the pairs to discuss among themselves:



How do the two narratives differ? What is similar about them?



What information did the autobiographer choose to highlight about

themselves? What information did their partner highlight?



Which biography is more reliable? Can either be seen as an "objective

source"?

3. Class Discussion about Activity��Bring the class back together and lead a discussion about their answers to the questions they discussed in their pairs. Use this activity to open a class discussion about how narratives are shaped by the assumptions

and biases of the author. Explain that the narratives we read or hear on a daily basis also shape our viewpoints, so we have to be careful to examine authors' motivations, underlying assumptions, and bias. Explain to students that narratives also influence our perceptions of members of different ethnic groups. Some discussion questions might include:



Where do we encounter narratives about other people?



What role do prior knowledge, preconceptions, or bias play in shaping

someone's narrative about other people?



How do narratives shape our opinions and affect our behavior towards

others?



What are some examples of narratives about you? How would your

parents or guardians talk about you? How would your siblings, your friends, your

teachers? And why would their narratives about you be different from each other?

And does it influence how they behave towards you?

4. Revisit Introductory Activity��Ask students to revisit the "Activating Prior Knowledge" questions that they answered at the beginning of class. Based on what they learned today, answer the questions again. How has their understanding of narrative changed? What questions are they left with? What do they want to learn more about?

Homework:

1. Reflect on Lesson's Takeaways��Students answer the questions on the Reflection handout on page 4 to help them consolidate and reflect upon what they learned in this lesson.

Reflection Worksheet Please answer each question in two or three sentences. [The suggested answers should, of course, be omitted in the worksheet given to the students.]
1. Where do we encounter narratives that shape our opinions? (everywhere, from the people around us to the news to television.)
2. How does an author's underlying assumptions shape their narrative? (It shapes how they interpret information that they're writing about.)
3. Why is it important to know the author's assumptions, preconceptions or biases in the narrative? (It helps us understand where they're coming from and whether we agree with them or not.)
4. How do authors demonstrate their opinions in narratives? (by the choices they make in what they highlight in the story and what voices they choose to feature)
5. What questions do you still have about narratives? (Students will ask: if all narrative is biased, how do I get to the truth of an event or a group of people?)
Sample Lesson 5: Introducing Dominant Narratives

This lesson is modeled on the University of Michigan's Inclusive Teaching Collaborative (ITC) (https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/) discussion guide on Dominant Narratives (https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/inclusive-teaching/sample-activities/dominant-narratives/). According to the ITC, a dominant narrative is "an explanation or story that is told in service of the dominant social group's interests and ideologies. It usually achieves dominance through repetition, the apparent authority of the speaker (often accorded to speakers who represent the dominant social groups), and the silencing of alternative accounts. Because dominant narratives are so normalized through their repetition and authority, they have the illusion of being objective and
apolitical, when in fact they are neither."[1] This lesson plan is designed to teach students how
to identify and critically evaluate dominant narratives they encounter in their daily lives. This lesson plan also addresses the role of power in perpetuating dominant narratives and determining who benefits from or is harmed by the persistence of these narratives.

Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):



identify examples of dominant narratives;



critically interrogate authoritative sources of information;



recognize bias in dominant narratives;



question whose voices are missing from dominant narratives and why; and



articulate how dominant narratives benefit dominant groups and harm

oppressed groups.

Key Concepts and Vocabulary:



Dominant Narrative (an explanation or story that is told in service of the

dominant social group's interests and ideologies)



Power (political or social authority)



Authority (the power or ability to make rules and influence others)



Oppression (unjust treatment of and control over an individual or group)



Normalization (making something conform to, or reducing something to a norm

or standard)

In-Class Activities:

1. Activate Prior Knowledge��Begin by writing the words "Dominant Narrative" on the whiteboard. Ask students to say what words or phrases come to their mind when they hear the term "dominant narrative." Using Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) or WordClouds (https://www.wordclouds.com/), create a word cloud based on the students' answers. You will create another word cloud at the end of the class to compare how students' understanding of dominant narratives has progressed through the lesson.

2. Show Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's Ted Talk "The Danger of a Single Story" (https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_ story?language=en&amp;t-261411)��This Ted Talk further explores the concept of dominant narratives by explaining the damaging effects of being exposed to only one powerful narrative. This video will help students to recognize one-sided perspectives, missing voices, and bias in the dominant narratives they encounter about ethnic groups.

3. Class Discussion about Narrative, Perspective, and Power��Lead a class discussion based on the main takeaways from Adichie's Ted Talk to help students understand the importance of critically engaging with and interrogating the dominant narratives they come across in their daily lives.

4. Class Discussion on Confronting Dominant Narratives��Write an example of a contemporary dominant narrative on the whiteboard. Some examples could include:
 "America is a land of equal opportunity. If someone does not succeed, it is because they did not try hard enough."
 "South and Central American migrants come to the United States to get free public benefits and take American jobs."

5. (Note: you may also want to ask students to brainstorm examples of dominant narratives that they have heard of, but only do so if you believe your students have the appropriate maturity to do this). Some of these examples may be uncomfortable for students. As the class facilitator, try to create an accepting environment where students feel "comfortable being uncomfortable" but never feel unsafe or triggered. Students are exposed to dominant narratives like the ones above in many different settings of their lives, so the goal of this lesson is to help students explicitly identify these narratives in order to confront them. In other words, students must recognize and understand dominant narratives before they can contribute to changing them.

Lead a class discussion around the example you wrote on the board. Guiding questions may include:



Have you ever heard this narrative? If so, where?



Whom does this narrative serve? (or who benefits from this

narrative?)



Whom does this narrative harm?



What assumptions are being made?



What stereotypes are being used?



Whose perspective is represented by this narrative?



What narratives or perspectives is it trying to silence?



Why do you suppose this narrative has power?



What is your personal reaction to this narrative?



How has this narrative impacted you? Do you benefit from it?

Does it harm you?



How have you participated in or resisted this narrative?

6. Group Break-Out Reading��Provide each student with a copy of the "What is a Dominant Narrative?" article and the note-taking sheet. Explain that this article will help students deepen their understanding of how dominant narratives function and why they are so persistent. Divide the class into groups of three or four students. Ask the students to read the article with their group members and take notes on the provided note-taking sheet.

7. Reflective Discussion��After students have finished reading and taking notes, bring the class back together to lead a reflective discussion about the main takeaways from the article and from the earlier class discussion. Guiding questions may include:



How has your understanding of dominant narratives changed?



How do dominant narratives benefit dominant groups?



How do dominant narratives harm oppressed groups?



What are some ways we can challenge dominant narratives?



What questions do you still have? What more would you

like to learn about dominant narratives?

8. Reflective Activity��Now that students have a better understanding of dominant narratives, ask students to say what words or phrases come to their mind when they hear the term "dominant narrative." Using Wordle (http://www.wordle.net/) or WordClouds (https://www.wordclouds.com/), create a word cloud based on the students' answers. Compare this word cloud with the one created at the beginning of class to help students visualize how their understanding of dominant narratives has progressed through the lesson.

Homework:

1. Create a Reference Guide��Ask students to create a reference guide for how to evaluate the various narratives they encounter in their lives. Students should use this homework assignment to design a plan for how to determine a narrative's reliability, motivation, and bias. If students need inspiration, refer them to the Lateral Reading

(https://cor.stanford.edu/curriculum/lessons/intro-to-lateral-reading/?cuid=teachinglateral-reading) technique or to the discussion questions presented in class.

What is a Dominant Narrative?
Every day we encounter narratives that shape the way we view the world around us. The narratives we hear or read every day on the news or in movies and books often represent the voices or perspectives of a society's dominant group. These narratives therefore often portray information in a way that is meant to serve the dominant social group's interests. These narratives are called "dominant narratives."
Dominant narratives "achieve dominance through repetition, the apparent authority of the speaker (often accorded to speakers who represent the dominant social groups),
and the silencing of alternative accounts."[2] Dominant narratives are normalized by
being presented as objective facts.
According to Kelly Morton, an activist from Philadelphia, "narratives around gender roles, body types, power, family, immigration, age, ability are all around us. They repeat to us who is dangerous, who is a hard worker, who is lazy, who is attractive, who deserves power. Even if we become aware of them and resist them, the world around
us is still playing them on loop and holding us to those narratives."[3]
Even though everyday people's experiences often contradict the information dominant narratives tell us, dominant narratives are so powerful because they are repeated with the clout of authority that comes with a mainstream source. Think of the American government: many Americans see the government as a credible source of information, so when a governmental official tells us something, we tend to believe it. This information is often presented as apolitical, objective truth, but often governmental officials have motivations for telling us certain information or framing a policy in a certain light.
For example, the harmful "War on Drugs" campaign began in the 1970s. The government framed this initiative as an attempt to create law and order and combat a
drug epidemic by increasing prison sentences for drug-related offenses.[4] The
dominant narrative of the "War on Drugs" was that drug dealers and users were causing violence, poverty, and addiction in cities across the country. In actuality, this narrative

was used to justify disproportionate arrests of communities of color, even though Blacks and Whites use drugs at similar rates. These discriminatory policies were meant to
perpetuate racialized social control.[5]
Dominant narratives in the United States often target non-White ethnic groups who face oppression at the hands of the dominant social group. We must constantly be vigilant when we read the news, study our textbooks, watch movies, or listen to politicians. Dominant narratives are so pervasive because they are everywhere and are repeated by the illusion of authority that comes with mainstream media, educational, and governmental sources. When we encounter dominant narratives, we must always ask "what is the motivation behind this narrative?" and "whose voice or voices am I missing?"

Sample Lesson 6: Important Historical Figures Among People of Color
Theme: History and Movement
Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies Grades 9�12
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 2, 6
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1�4
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 6
CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson introduces students to some of the complex people and concepts used to understand the experience of people of color in the United States.
As part of a larger unit on understanding the contributions and role that people of color have played in the building of the United States, this lesson on historical figures guides students to explore individuals within a historically oppressed community. Furthermore, students will understand how these historical figures contributed to a broader social movement that challenged racism, sexism or classism. Students will analyze the impact of that broader movement on the community and institutional structures, through research and analysis utilizing critical questions to guide their research and then presenting a biographical pictorial timeline significance PowerPoint to the class.
Key Terms and Concepts: Social movement, institutional racism
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. conduct research utilizing the critical essential questions; 2. create a pictorial presentation, with captions, timeline, poem and quotes; and

3. strengthen their research, analytical reading and notetaking, presentation creation, and public speaking skills through presenting their research findings.
Essential Questions:
1. What were the upbringing, class background, life experiences, and decisions made by the figure?
2. What made this figure an important person in the movement for racial equality? How did they challenge systems of white supremacy?
3. How did their leadership and achievements contribute to the movement for racial and economic equality?
4. What can we learn from this figure about how we should challenge white supremacy today?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Teachers can let students choose a figure from the list provided, depending on the students' interest. The teacher may assign students a historical figure. Teachers can challenge students by choosing a figure that is not from their ethnic background to expand their knowledge of other groups.
2. Research: Once all students have a historical figure, walk through the steps of doing the research using the Source/Notes page. Make sure students are versed in evaluating valid sources on the internet, making sure the sources are not biased, misleading, or nonfactual. Students should choose 2�3 valid sources on their figure with each source covering a variety of information. Demonstrate how to read for factual information and write notes in the Source/Notes page. Ensure the source information is complete. Students should use the four essential questions to guide their research.
3. After the research is completed, students should prepare a visual biography PowerPoint presentation which will include:
a. Title: Create a title using the name of your person with a picture. Also put your name, instructor's name, subject, and period.

b. Address all four essential questions in your presentation using photos, drawings, captions, bullet points.
c. Poem: Write a biography poem about your person.
d. Quotes: Collect 1�3 or more quotes from or about your person.
e. Illustrations: Use pictures or drawings highlighting your person's life and accomplishments.
f. Captions: Type appropriate captions to explain your illustrations.
g. Annotated Timeline: Show important events and dates relevant to your figure.
4. Resume: Students will create a resume for their figure. 5. The PowerPoint will be followed up with the students writing a "Biographical Research
Essay" using Modern Language Association documentation format. 6. Other considerations:
Some of the figures on this list might be controversial. There are people who were controversial in their own lifetimes, but people felt differently years later. Or, there are people who were popular during their lifetimes who became controversial later on.
 Is this a controversial figure? Why would some people have strong negative or positive feelings about this figure?
Some of these figures are on the list because they have made key cultural contributions.
 Has your figure made a significant cultural contribution?
Culminating Activity
1. The final activity for students will be to become their figure. This step will be accomplished by writing a speech in the voice of the individual they have been researching and by presenting that speech in costume to a group of their peers.

2. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a 30-minute oral history interview with their interviewees, and transcribe at least one interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for copies of old pictures, images of relics that hold some significant meaning or value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.
3. Students are allotted three days to work on their presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an opportunity to practice their presentations with peer-to-peer and peer-to-small-group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.
4. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations, students in the audience should be active listeners, taking notes, and asking follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using "the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.
5. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by coordinating a community presentation event.

Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:



Peer assessments are used to help students refine their PowerPoint

presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the practice

groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having difficulty with the

assignment.



During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students'

presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS for

ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.



Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively

they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student presenters.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson introduces students to the process of purchasing a home, while addressing the history of US housing discrimination. Students will learn about redlining, racial covenants, and better understand why African Americans, as well as other people of color, have historically settled in certain neighborhoods, whether voluntarily or involuntarily. Additionally, students will be able to better contextualize the state's current housing crisis. With regards to skills, students will analyze primary source documents like original house deeds, conduct research (including locating US census data), and write a brief research essay or complete a presentation on their key findings.
Key Terms and Concepts: segregation, racial housing covenants, gentrification, redlining
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. draw connections between what they learned from the lesson overview, A Raisin in the Sun, and their own narratives, highlighting the overarching theme of housing inequality;
2. understand how housing inequality has manifest in the form of institutional racism through racial housing covenants, redlining, and other forms of legalized segregation;
3. engage and comprehend contemporary language being used to describe the current housing crisis and the history of racial housing segregation (i.e., gentrification, resegregation, and redlining); and
4. analyze Lorraine Hansberry's play, A Raisin in the Sun, identifying key themes as they relate to housing discrimination, and become familiar with the use of dramatic devices in written plays.
Essential Questions:
1. How are wealth and housing inequality connected? 2. How is housing discrimination and segregation a form of institutional racism?

1. Introduce the lesson by posting the definition of "racial housing covenants" and "redlining" to engage students in a discussion on the housing conditions African Americans often encounter in urban cities, both in the past and currently.

2. Provide an abbreviated walk-through of how to purchase a home (identifying a realtor, finding a lender, mentioning the Federal Housing Administration and loan underwriters, etc.). See videos in resources section for more context. 1. Request for students to research and find evidence of how African Americans have historically been subjected to housing discrimination. Provide the examples of the Federal Housing Administration's refusal to underwrite loans for African Americans looking to purchase property in white neighborhoods through 1968, and the California Rumford Fair Housing Act (1963�1968) as back up information. Furthermore, request for more contemporary examples of housing discrimination against African Americans. Provide backup information on the disproportionate provision of poor quality housing loans (subprime) to African Americans (which ultimately resulted in many African American families losing their homes during the 2008 economic crash and recession), if needed (the use of primary sources such as digital maps are suggested for this part of the lesson).
3. Consider using Lorraine Hansberry's A Raisin in the Sun as a supporting text. Have students read Act II Scene III. Following the in-class reading, ask students to reflect on Mr. Lindner's character and how he is connected to the larger discussion of housing inequality. How is Mr. Lindner aiding in housing discrimination?
4. After completing A Raisin in the Sun, continue to build on this lesson by introducing students to "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races," two digital mapping websites that include primary sources on redlining and racial housing covenants in the US. Then provide students with an overview of the two websites, highlighting the various features and resources.
5. For the culminating activity, assign students into pairs where they are tasked with delving into the "Mapping Inequality" and "T-Races" archives. After identifying a California city (must be a city that is on the T-RACES digital archive) that each pair would like to study, they should be tasked with completing the following over two weeks: 1. Describe how race factors into the makeup of the city being studied. 2. Identify any racial housing covenants for the city being studied. 3. List any barriers that may have limited African Americans from living in certain neighborhoods within the city. 4. Identify areas where African Americans were encouraged to live or where they were able to create racial enclaves.

5. Identify current US Census data and housing maps on how the city/neighborhoods look now, specifically noting racial demographics.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14 of the framework includes an outline of an elective ethnic studies course. This course outline includes a classroom example (page 313) where students engage in an oral history project about their community. This example includes discussion of redlining and other policies that resulted in "white flight" and the concentration of communities of color into certain neighborhoods.
Teachers can expand upon the current lesson by using this example, and connecting it to the themes described in this model curriculum.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
� Students will conduct research (identifying primary sources) on the history of housing discrimination and redlining across California cities, some of the housing issues today, and how different ethnic groups are impacted.
� Students will write a standard four-paragraph essay or 5�7 minute oral presentation on their research findings.
� Have students reflect on how this history of housing discrimination has (or has not) impacted their own families' housing options and livelihoods.
� Students will share their research findings with an audience such as, family, community members, online, elected officials, etc.

A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry
Act II Scene Three
Man in a business suit holding his hat and a briefcase in his hand and consulting a small piece of paper)
MAN Uh--how do you do, miss. I am looking for a Mrs.--(He looks at the slip of paper) Mrs. Lena Younger? (He stops short, struck dumb at the sight of the oblivious WALTER and RUTH)
BENEATHA (Smoothing her hair with slight embarrassment) Oh--yes, that's my mother. Excuse me (She closes the door and turns to quiet the other two) Ruth! Brother! (Enunciating precisely but soundlessly: "There's a white man at the door!" They stop dancing, RUTH cuts off the phonograph, BENEATHA opens the door. The man casts a curious quick glance at all of them) Uh--come in please.
MAN (Coming in) Thank you.
BENEATHA My mother isn't here just now. Is it business?
MAN Yes ... well, of a sort.
WALTER (Freely, the Man of the House) Have a seat. I'm Mrs. Younger's son. I look after most of her business matters. (RUTH and BENEATHA exchange amused glances)
MAN (Regarding WALTER, and sitting) Well--My name is Karl Lindner ...
WALTER (Stretching out his hand) Walter Younger. This is my wife--(RUTH nods politely)-- and my sister.
LINDNER How do you do.

WALTER (Amiably, as he sits himself easily on a chair, leaning forward on his knees with interest and looking expectantly into the newcomer's face) What can we do for you, Mr. Lindner!
LINDNER (Some minor shuffling of the hat and briefcase on his knees) Well--I am a representative of the Clybourne Park Improvement Association--
WALTER (Pointing) Why don't you sit your things on the floor?
LINDNER Oh--yes. Thank you. (He slides the briefcase and hat under the chair) And as I was saying--I am from the Clybourne Park Improvement Association and we have had it brought to our attention at the last meeting that you people--or at least your mother--has bought a piece of residential property at--(He digs for the slip of paper again)--four o six Clybourne Street ...
WALTER That's right. Care for something to drink? Ruth, get Mr. Lindner a beer.
LINDNER (Upset for some reason) Oh--no, really. I mean thank you very much, but no thank you.
RUTH (Innocently) Some coffee?
LINDNER Thank you, nothing at all. (BENEATHA is watching the man carefully)
LINDNER Well, I don't know how much you folks know about our organization. (He is a gentle man; thoughtful and somewhat labored in his manner) It is one of these community organizations set up to look after--oh, you know, things like block upkeep and special projects and we also have what we call our New Neighbors Orientation Committee ...
BENEATHA (Drily) Yes--and what do they do?
LINDNER (Turning a little to her and then returning the main force to WALTER) Well--it's what you might call a sort of welcoming committee, I guess. I mean they, we--I'm the chairman of the committee--go around and see the new people who move into the neighborhood and sort of give them the lowdown on the way we do things out in Clybourne Park.
BENEATHA (With appreciation of the two meanings, which escape RUTH and WALTER) Unhuh.

LINDNER And we also have the category of what the association calls--(He looks elsewhere)-- uh--special community problems ...
BENEATHA Yes--and what are some of those?
WALTER Girl, let the man talk.
LINDNER (With understated relief) Thank you. I would sort of like to explain this thing in my own way. I mean I want to explain to you in a certain way.
WALTER Go ahead.
LINDNER Yes. Well. I'm going to try to get right to the point. I'm sure we'll all appreciate that in the long run.
BENEATHA Yes.
WALTER Be still now!
LINDNER Well--
RUTH (Still innocently) Would you like another chair--you don't look comfortable.
LINDNER (More frustrated than annoyed) No, thank you very much. Please. Well--to get right to the point I--(A great breath, and he is off at last) I am sure you people must be aware of some of the incidents which have happened in various parts of the city when colored people have moved into certain areas--(BENEATHA exhales heavily and starts tossing a piece of fruit up and down in the air) Well--because we have what I think is going to be a unique type of organization in American community life--not only do we deplore that kind of thing--but we are trying to do something about it. (BENEATHA stops tossing and turns with a new and quizzical interest to the man) We feel-- (gaining confidence in his mission because of the interest in the faces of the people he is talking to)--we feel that most of the trouble in this world, when you come right down to it--(He hits his knee for emphasis)--most of the trouble exists because people just don't sit down and talk to each other.
RUTH (Nodding as she might in church, pleased with the remark) You can say that again, mister.

LINDNER (More encouraged by such affirmation) That we don't try hard enough in this world to understand the other fellow's problem. The other guy's point of view.
RUTH Now that's right. (BENEATHA and WALTER merely watch and listen with genuine interest)
LINDNER Yes--that's the way we feel out in Clybourne Park. And that's why I was elected to come here this afternoon and talk to you people. Friendly like, you know, the way people should talk to each other and see if we couldn't find some way to work this thing out. As I say, the whole business is a matter of caring about the other fellow. Anybody can see that you are a nice family of folks, hard working and honest I'm sure. (BENEATHA frowns slightly, quizzically, her head tilted regarding him) Today everybody knows what it means to be on the outside of something. And of course, there is always somebody who is out to take advantage of people who don't always understand.
WALTER What do you mean?
LINDNER Well--you see our community is made up of people who've worked hard as the dickens for years to build up that little community. They're not rich and fancy people; just hardworking, honest people who don't really have much but those little homes and a dream of the kind of community they want to raise their children in. Now, I don't say we are perfect and there is a lot wrong in some of the things they want. But you've got to admit that a man, right or wrong, has the right to want to have the neighborhood he lives in a certain kind of way. And at the moment the overwhelming majority of our people out there feel that people get along better, take more of a common interest in the life of the community, when they share a common background. I want you to believe me when I tell you that race prejudice simply doesn't enter into it. It is a matter of the people of Clybourne Park believing, rightly or wrongly, as I say, that for the happiness of all concerned that our Negro families are happier when they live in their own communities.
BENEATHA (With a grand and bitter gesture) This, friends, is the Welcoming Committee!
WALTER (Dumbfounded, looking at LINDNER) IS this what you came marching all the way over here to tell us?
LINDNER Well, now we've been having a fine conversation. I hope you'll hear me all the way through.

WALTER (Tightly) Go ahead, man.
LINDNER You see--in the face of all the things I have said, we are prepared to make your family a very generous offer ...
BENEATHA Thirty pieces and not a coin less!
WALTER Yeah?
LINDNER (Putting on his glasses and drawing a form out of the briefcase) Our association is prepared, through the collective effort of our people, to buy the house from you at a financial gain to your family.
RUTH Lord have mercy, ain't this the living gall!
WALTER All right, you through?
LINDNER Well, I want to give you the exact terms of the financial arrangement--
WALTER We don't want to hear no exact terms of no arrangements. I want to know if you got any more to tell us 'bout getting together?
LINDNER (Taking off his glasses) Well--I don't suppose that you feel ...
WALTER Never mind how I feel--you got any more to say 'bout how people ought to sit down and talk to each other? ... Get out of my house, man. (He turns his back and walks to the door)
LINDNER (Looking around at the hostile faces and reaching and assembling his hat and briefcase) Well--I don't understand why you people are reacting this way. What do you think you are going to gain by moving into a neighborhood where you just aren't wanted and where some elements--well--people can get awful worked up when they feel that their whole way of life and everything they've ever worked for is threatened.
WALTER Get out.
LINDNER (At the door, holding a small card) Well--I'm sorry it went like this.
WALTER Get out.

LINDNER (Almost sadly regarding WALTER) You just can't force people to change their hearts, son. (He turns and put his card on a table and exits. WALTER pushes the door to with stinging hatred, and stands looking at it. RUTH just sits and BENEATHA just stands.
Sample Lesson 8: #BlackLivesMatter and Social Change
Theme: Social Movements and Equity
Disciplinary Area: African American Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 4; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 1, 2
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 5, 6, 7
CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Students will be exposed to contemporary discussions around policing in the US, specifically police brutality cases where unarmed African Americans have been killed. They will conduct research on various incidents, deciphering between reputable and scholarly sources versus those with particular political bents. Students will also begin to think about how they would respond if an incident took place in their community. Students will have the opportunity, via the social change projects, to describe what tools and/or tactics of resistance they would use. With regards to skills, students will learn how to develop their own informational videos, conduct research, and work collaboratively.
Key Terms and Concepts: racial profiling, oppression, police brutality, social movements, resistance
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. develop an understanding and analyze the effectiveness of #BlackLivesMatter and the broader Movement for Black Lives (M4BL), specifically delving into the movement's

structure, key organizations, and tactics/actions used to respond to incidents of police brutality; and 2. identify how African Americans have historically been disproportionately impacted by racial profiling and police brutality in the US
Essential Questions:
1. Why, how, and when did #blacklivesmatter and the Movement for Black Lives emerge? 2. What can be done to help those impacted by police brutality and racial profiling?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Begin the lesson by discussing a recent incident in your community where an African American has been subjected to racial profiling or police brutality. If you are unable to find a specific incident that took place in your community, highlight a national incident.
2. Link this incident to the broader Movement for Black Lives. Be sure to provide some context on the movement, including its history, organizations associated with the movement, key activists and leaders, the Movement for Black Lives policy platform, tactics, and key incidents the movement has responded to.
3. After completing the reading and discussion, provide an overview of the Movement for Black Lives for students, detailing key shootings, defining and framing terms (i.e., riot vs. rebellion, antiblackness, state sanctioned violence, etc.), highlighting the narratives of Black women and LGBTQIA identifying people that have been impacted by police brutality, and providing various examples of the tactics of resistance used by activists and organizers within the movement.
4. In groups of four, students select an issue relating to the justice system that has been a focal point within the Black movement. Each group is responsible for researching the following: 1. Describe the issue and the surrounding details. 2. What are the arguments? Present all sides. 3. Investigate the underlying context: Research the root causes of the issue. 4. What is the legal context surrounding the issue? (e.g., stand your ground, stop and frisk, noise ordinance, police officers bill of rights, cash bail system, 3-Strikes laws, prison abolition, the death penalty, etc.)?

5. What was/has been the community's response? Were there any protests or direct actions? If so, what types of tactics did activists employ?
6. What organizations are working to address this issue? 7. What social changes, political changes, or policy changes occurred or are being
proposed to address the underlying issue?? 5. Students are encouraged to identify sources online (including looking at social media
posts or hashtags that feature the name of the person they are studying), examine scholarly books and articles, and even contact non-profits or grassroots organizations that may be organizing around the case that they were assigned. Stress the importance of students being able to identify credible first-person sources. 6. As a second component of this lesson, each student (individually) is tasked with responding to the last question required for their project, "what can you do to help support those impacted by police brutality?" In response, students must come up with an idea/plan of how they would help advocate for change in their communities if an issue around police brutality were to arise. Please note that this exercise is to explore the possible actions of advocacy for social justice and social change. Students should not be encouraged to place themselves or others in a situation that could lead to physical conflict. 7. Students should be provided an additional week to produce their individual "social change" projects, whether it be drawing a protest poster or drafting a plan to organize a direct action.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
� Students will research issues surrounding the impact of the justice system on African American communities and respond to key questions.
� Students will complete an action-oriented "social change" assignment where they are expected to consider how they would respond if an incident of police brutality occurred in their community.

Sample Lesson 9: Classical Africa and Other Major Civilizations
Theme: Identity
Disciplinary Area: African American Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 3 ,4, 7
Standards Alignment: HSS 10.4
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking: 1, 2, 3; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View: 4 Historical Interpretation 4; Historical Interpretation: 3, 4

CA ELD Standards: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5, 1.10
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Students will explore the classical African backgrounds of African Americans, perhaps giving them the first information about the origin of African civilization. They will examine the beginning of writing, mathematics, architecture, and medicine in the Nile Valley civilization, specifically Kemet, Nubia, and Axum. Students will also be introduced to other major African civilizations such as ancient Ghana, Mali, Songhay, Yoruba, Kongo and Zimbabwe. Students will conduct research on numerous topics surrounding the emergence of cultural forms, musical and dance, philosophies, political organization, and art and philosophy in the Nile Valley cluster of civilizations as well as the West and Southern African civilizations. Students will be exposed to African philosophers such as Ptahhotep, Imhotep, Akhenaten, and Merikare. Among the themes of this course will be the origin of the universe, that is, the creation myths from ancient Kemet, the ethical concept of Maat as an African cultural concept and its use as a philosophy underpinning social development. Maat represents balance, truth, harmony, and justice. Female

and male roles in across ancient African society were based on the principles of Maat. Women have played central leadership roles in classical African civilization. Students will be asked to think about how the people of Axum built stelae as examples of historical memory.
Key Terms and Concepts: civilization, culture, philosophy, architecture, Maat, Nile Valley
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. understand the importance of culture to African values and beliefs; 2. develop an understanding and analyze the classical history of African people; 3. identify how African classical cultures set the models for future civilizations in terms of
philosophy, architecture, medicine, spirituality, and mathematics; and

4

understand the relationship to Africa of all people and the nature of world

development from an African perspective which challenges the particular racial

constructions of enslavement, colonialization, and imposition on African women, men

and children. Thus, students will be able to deconstruct racial imaginations regarding

their common humanity.

Essential Questions:

1. What were the antecedents to the Classical African civilizations? Use references to archaeological creations such as Inzalo Y'Langa, or Adam's Calendar, as a point of departure to examine the ancient past of Africa.
2. How did Africans in the Americas and many in Africa lose sight of their contact with their own classical past? How was it erased, distorted, and colonized?
3. What is the point of today's modern African Americans making links to their African cultural past?

Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. To access this lesson, have the students think of something in today's society that came from Africa. Prompt them with the Washington monument (show image if possible) then show image of the obelisks of Egypt and Ethiopia (Aksum, also spelled Axum). Use the pyramid on the back of the dollar bill to let them know it is an African architectural design. Think of other connections, the calendar, and the 24-hour day.

2. Begin the lesson by discussing why Inzalo Y'Langa, popularly named Adam's Calendar, is called the oldest human made structure in the world? Show on the map where it is located in southern Africa and point out that even if it is not more than 100,000 years old as suggested, it is still older than the Great Pyramid on the same continent and Stonehenge in England.
3. From the map of Africa point to the Nile Valley and explain the fact that the Nile River, the earth's longest flows through only one continent, Africa. Explain to the students that the Nile River runs down to the Mediterranean from the up in the interior of Africa around Uganda and Rwanda, almost touching the other great river of Africa, the Congo.
4. Engage students in a study of the history of the Sahara Desert, the world's largest, showing how it was not always a massive desert and that humans in the past had occupied it for thousands of years.
5. Divide the students into three groups and assign each group a civilization to report on (e.g., Kemet, Nubia, Axum). Each group is responsible for researching the following:
a. Describe the region where the civilization is located by stating on what continent it is found, its chronology, that is, when was it developed, its major contributions that could be considered permanent, and identify the people who may have been influenced in language, customs, and traditions by this civilization.
b. Allow the students to choose one of these cultures--Yoruba, Zimbabwe, or Asante--and ask them to write a two-page narrative of the history of the people.
c. What were the borders, as far as scholars are concerned, of these civilizations? What other kingdoms, empires, or nations were connected to them?
d. Show evidences of the impact of these civilizations in contemporary life in the United States that might be invisible to most people. Do you see pyramids anywhere? For example, the American dollar has a pyramid on it. Anywhere else? What does the Washington monument look like when you think of ancient Axum or Kemet?
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

� Students will research examples of American and European museums with African art. Have students write about the Boston Museum's Nubian collection, the Brooklyn Museum's Egyptian collection, and the UCLA's African Art collection. � Students will complete their own collages of photos and information they have learned from reading materials and will be asked to divide into three groups where some students will be producers-designers, others will be writers of the script, and others class presenters of the information.

Students will be introduced to and explore the contributions of African Americans in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), literature and journalism, education, government and business/entrepreneurship. Key Terms and Concepts: technology, science, innovation, space, journalism, literature and literary genres, armed forces, government, business, entrepreneurship, ingenuity, segregation, economic advancement, Harlem Renaissance, Jim Crow Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. develop research questions in order to conduct exploratory research into historical events and figures;
2. interpret historical narratives in order to develop a more robust understanding of historical events and figures;

3. learn from each other by presenting the histories and contributions of African Americans that are often unknown or often untold. Explain the role African Americans have played in the advancement of the science, technology and other areas in the American society;
4. strengthen their public speaking skills through presenting their research findings; 5. build upon interpersonal communication skills in order to adequately receive and convey
information; and 6. compile research and information in order to create a visual presentation or display of a
historical event or figure.
Essential Questions:
1. What contributions have African Americans made to the United States, and how has society benefited from them?
2. Why are some of these contributions not widely known? 3. How can these contributions be given greater recognition in society today?
Part 1: Research Presentation
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Develop an electronic visual presentation for the lesson opening that shows images of various contributions in the five areas of science and mathematics, literature and journalism, education, government, and business/entrepreneurship. The presentation ends with the quote: "There is nothing new in the world except the history you do not know." Harry S. Truman 33rd President of the United States. As students view the presentation invite them to write down what they know and what they want to know about the images.
2. Introduce the lesson by asking students what they believe all of these things have in common. This should be a class conversation.
3. Present the five stations of African American contributions, being sure to connect them with the images and discussions from steps 1 and 2.
4. Invite students to explore the five stations in the in-person or virtual classroom and view the introductory resources on each topic. As students view the introductory resources, they write down their learnings as well as their wonderings and identify one station further research.

5. Students should find additional sources of information on their topic of choice to conduct further research.
6. After students have completed their exploration of the different stations, they should compose a written response to the three essential questions that includes information they have learned from the lesson. Students should be encouraged to identify possible topics or areas of focus for further research in their responses. Time permitting, students can share these responses in small groups or with a partner.
Part 2: Museum Curation
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Review the five stations that were discussed in Part 1. Then ask students to briefly discuss Essential Questions 1�3.
2. After the discussion, transition to discussing the value of museums as a way to bring the contributions of African Americans to the broader society. Provide examples of the African American Museum in DC and other museums or public displays in the local or surrounding areas. Also provide some examples of digital museum exhibits for local and national collections.
3. Introduce the project: museum curation. Each student will be creating a museum exhibit based on one historical figure or contribution from the stations that they explored previously. Instruct students to look for primary and secondary sources that can teach them more about their subject. These sources could be texts or oral histories found in the available databases. Students can also interview experts to gather more information. Interviews can be conducted in person or remotely.
4. After introducing the project and providing examples of museum exhibits, provide an overview of the expectations for the research and presentations. Discuss the types of equipment and materials students will need; help students understand the difference between secondary and primary sources.
5. Allow the use of the next few class periods for students to conduct further research. Assist students with narrowing or broadening their research topic based on the amount of available information available on their topic of choice. 1. Students may use relevant resources that they discovered during the first part of this lesson.

2. For more rigor, students can be required to have a specific number of primary sources and secondary sources.
6. Once students have completed their research, ask students to create their own museum exhibit complete with pictures and artifacts related to their topic. The resources that they collected should be used as source materials for their exhibit. 1. The exhibit should have at least one picture of the subject and a written description of the exhibit.
7. Students will develop a presentation to describe their learnings from their station and their historical even or figure. Each presentation should be no more than two minutes in length. 1. Students will be the curators of their own classroom museum. The classroom should be arranged in stations where corresponding exhibits will be displayed. 2. Alternate display for distance learning: Students will create a one-slide PowerPoint display which will be displayed via the "share screen" option of the distance learning platform.
8. After presentations are completed, the teacher facilitates the discussion of the essential questions.
Lesson Resources:
Note: The lists contained in these resources are in no way exhaustive. They should be used as an initial suggestion of possible events or historical figures that can be expanded and modified to meet the needs of individual classrooms. Students are encouraged to find others not on these lists.
Station 1: Science, Technology, and Mathematics
Station Purpose and Overview:
Students will discover the amazing history of African American inventors, designers, and scientists who have contributed to the making of the contemporary American society. Students will learn about the use of African creative strategies during the period of enslavement and the

burst of inventions that occurred at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Numerous inventors who had not been recognized during the enslavement for their innovations became known as designers and creators of useful objects and processes for a modern society. It is not striking that a people who had been responsible for so much of the daily operations of farms, plantation houses, mechanical systems, and construction would now emerge from the shadows as some of the creators of the most common elements used in our work. Students will be able to understand how and why the agricultural worker or the mechanic would be inclined to create innovation. Consequently, this lesson will pave the way for the student to see how integral the inventions, innovations, and scientific work of African Americans are to everyday life.

Invite students to watch the introductory video on the Harlem Renaissance:
History Brief: The Harlem Renaissance: https://youtu.be/90PTxdsqfsA
Introduction to the Harlem Renaissance: Students will explore the vibrant artistic and intellectual life brought to New York and other northeastern American cities by African Americans fleeing the South in a large and massive migration to the North and away from the brutality of the postReconstruction era. At the same time, Africans from the African continent, South America, and every Caribbean island entered New York's Manhattan Island's northern section, and it, Harlem, became the liveliest gathering place of African ideas on the earth. Politicians, novelists, musicians, artists, newspaper publishers, business people, dancers, choreographers, lawyers, playwrights, and poets assembled in the parlors, salons, and stately houses in uptown New York to revive and remake the black tradition. Students will learn how the Great Migration changed the way African Americans saw themselves and the way others saw them. The book, The New Negro, by Alain Locke, a Philadelphian, is often called the work that began the Harlem Renaissance. Although the literary aspect of the Harlem Renaissance is the most noted and known by virtue of the writers who articulated the ideas of African Americans who resisted segregation, discrimination, and second-class citizenship.
Students explore African American writers, journalists, and artists.

Sample Lesson 11: Afrofuturism: Reimagining Black Futures and Science Fiction
Grade levels: 9�12
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 4, 5, 7
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1, 2, 4; Historical Interpretation 1, 2, 4.
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH. 9�10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9; WHST.9�10. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10
CA ELD Standards: ELD. PI. 9�10. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, 12.
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Afrofuturism serves as a framework to better understand the growing popularity of Black science fiction and how the genre is being used to reimagine Black life. It is also a cultural aesthetic that incorporates technoculture and the supernatural while explicitly centering people of African descent. More recently artists, musicians, filmmakers, and writers--including Octavia Butler, Janelle Monae, Ryan Coogler, The Movement for Black Lives, Roxane Gay, Tananarive Due, and Nalo Hopkinson, to name a few--have drawn from this analytic framework and aesthetic as an inspiration for their own projects. While their work often features Black life suspended in space or utilizing imagined technologies, Afrofuturism also calls upon authors and artists to reimagine Black life beyond the status quo and to explore the infinite possibilities of the world of tomorrow. Increasingly, activists have used the framework to reimagine a world void of oppression and exploitative systems of power.

This lesson is designed to introduce students to the analytic framework and aesthetic of Afrofuturism through literature, science fiction, art, music, and theoretical texts. By engaging Afrofuturism, students will be able to better understand how authors and artists are using literature, music, film, and other modes of cultural production to describe Black experiences and theorize new possibilities. More specifically, students will be able to identify and engage social and political critiques that manifest in Afrofuturist texts. With regards to skills, students will primarily gain experience with the qualitative method of cultural analysis. Drawing on various cultural texts, students will analyze the various ways in which Afrofuturist themes manifest and articulate how they act (or do not) as social and/or cultural critiques; are indicative of cultural phenomena, practices, ideologies, and/or trends; or are used to make an intervention and state something entirely new. With an emphasis on developing analytical skills, students will also gain more experience with conducting research, evaluating primary and secondary source materials, practicing "close reading" and expository and creative writing.
Lesson Note: While this lesson has been developed with a focus on Black experiences and futures, it should also be noted that Chicana futurism, Latinx futurism, and Desi futurism (which refers to the forward-looking or future-focused mediums that relate to South Asian culture including literature, music, art, film, and visual and performing arts) are also budding fields and genres. Thus, this lesson can be adapted for other ethnic experiences with the inclusion of appropriate source materials.
Key Terms and Ethnic Studies Concepts: Afrofuturism, reimagine, science fiction (sci-fi), time, space, aesthetic
Content and Language Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. identify and analyze Afrofuturism as it manifests within various forms of art and cultural production, including literature, music, comic books, and film;
2. understand how systems of power and history are being reimagined through the lens of Afrofuturism;
3. discern how authors and artists use literary and poetic devices and technology within Afrofuturist texts; and
4. develop and reflect on new strategies, policies, and systems of power that address current social, economic, and political issues.

Essential Questions:
1. What is Afrofuturism? 2. What does it mean to reimagine life beyond the status quo? 3. What is the role of art and cultural production? 4. How does Afrofuturist art and cultural production serve as a critique of history, the status
quo, and systems of power?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1
1. Introduce the lesson by asking students to pull out a sheet of paper and write what they believe Afrofuturism is. Give students up to five minutes to complete this quick writing exercise.
2. After everyone has had an opportunity to reflect on the prompt, have students share their responses with a partner/neighbor or two first, then aloud.
3. Following this discussion, provide each student with an article on Afrofuturism (options in resources below). Break the students into groups of four and have each group read the text amongst themselves. Let the students know that they should make annotations as they read, noting keywords, themes, quotes that stand out, and terms that they may not be familiar with.
4. After each group has finished reading the excerpt, task them with writing a quick summary (no more than three sentences) of how the author frames Afrofuturism. Ask them to discuss how the excerpt echoes, differs, or builds upon what they wrote in their quick writing exercise.
5. Have the groups share some of their takeaways and summaries of the article with the entire class. Also use this time to define any terms that students may have been unfamiliar with. 1. Potential Terms to Define:
i. Subaltern��the term is primarily used to describe people socially and politically marginalized within society; those who are deemed powerless, especially within colonial territories.

ii. Pulp��the term has historically been used to describe early magazines that were printed on low quality paper made from wood pulp. However, the term has been used more broadly to describe works of art and literature (e.g., fiction, music, zines, etc.) that often included sensational material, short-fiction works, and what was often viewed as "low-quality literature." Pulp fiction and other works are often seen as the predecessors of superhero comic books.
iii. Speculative fiction��is a broad artistic genre that is defined by its inclusion of supernatural, futuristic, and dystopian elements. Speculative fiction includes the genres of: science fiction, fantasy, horror, fairytales, superhero fiction, and more.
iv. Appropriate/appropriation��to take elements of something for one's own use, often without permission.
v. Antebellum��refers to the period in the United States prior to the Civil War.
Day 2
1. Start the second day by discussing the diversity of Afrofuturism. Coined in the 1990s, Afrofuturism is a cultural aesthetic, philosophy of science, and philosophy of history that explores the developing intersection of African diaspora culture with technology. It is grounded in the belief of a better future for African Americans and aims to connect those from the Black diaspora with their African ancestry.
Show students that Afrofuturism can be found in artwork, literature, fashion, film, and music as well by providing students with a sampling of classroom and age appropriate Afrofuturistic examples of the teacher's choosing.
Afrofuturism is often marked visually with African iconology like the use of Adinkra symbols or Ancient Egyptian artifacts (i.e., ankh, eyes of Horus, pyramids, etc.). Sun Ra, Earth, Wind, and Fire, George Clinton, and Parliament-Funkadelic were well known for incorporating such symbolism into their music and album art. Also present in the aesthetic repertoire of Afrofuturism is a bright and diverse color palette, mysticism,

extraordinary abilities and powers, and technology and technoculture. Steampunk also has found its place in the Afrofuturistic aesthetic. More contemporary artists like Missy Elliot, Beyonce and Jay-Z, Kamasi Washington, and Janelle Monae are known for incorporating such elements in their music videos. The Studio Museum in Harlem showcased Afrofuturistic artwork in some of their exhibits as well. The Ford Theater production of "The Wiz" fused these elements into a classic retelling of "The Wizard of Oz." Additionally, writers such as W.E.B DuBois and Octavia Butler explore Afrofuturism in their works.
Afrofuturism is intriguing because of its visual aesthetic, but its purpose is much bolder. By design, it is intended to challenge the status quo by reimagining and confronting everyday challenges that African Americans face. Topics like racism, disenfranchisement, social inequality, and the pursuit of justice often find a home in Afrofuturistic works. Characters like Luke Cage explore the alternate possibilities for African Americans men--in this case by imagining an African American man impervious to bullets. Others, like the fictional country of "Wakanda," in "Black Panther," imagine a society where Africans or African Americans are economically, technologically, and socially advanced.
Essentially, Afrofuturism is a vehicle through which artists, writers, musicians, film makers, fashion designers, and others express their frustrations with the current condition of African Americans in society and posit a new theory of what could be, what could have been, and what will be if these issues are addressed and resolved. While a utopian society without social injustice and racism may seem like a dream, it is one the contributors to this genre are willing to aspire to and work towards through their own contributions in the Afrofuturistic space.
2. Engage students in a discussion around what is and is not Afrofuturism grounded in contemporary examples that students may be familiar with. 1. Guide the students through features like settings, characters, and other literary devices and elements of Afrofuturism.

books Black Panther.

i. Option: Utilize the recent film and comic

ii. Option: Teachers can also select a podcast, text, short story, or novel.
3. Break the students into groups and ask them to brainstorm other elements that may be found in Afrofuturism.
4. Once students have had a chance to discuss some ideas, ask them to imagine an Afrofuturistic setting in which a story may take place. 1. Using butcher paper or large post-it paper, students will write down their ideas.
5. Ask student groups to share their settings with the class and explain why they chose the details that they did.
Day 3
1. As a class, revisit the texts from Day 2 and begin to discuss how the texts draw on Afrofuturism. If possible, bring in copies of comic books, short stories, and zines.
2. After discussing the cultural texts for 10�15 minutes, let the students know that they will create their own cultural text that engages Afrofuturism and/or reimagines their own community's future.
3. Select a short story, poem, or song lyrics for students to read, and guide them through a discussion of the elements of Afrofuturism.
4. Introduce the assignment by telling students that they have the option of creating a zine, comic book, short story, or poem that incorporates what they've learned about Afrofuturism, specifically drawing on the overall aesthetic and analytical framework. They will also need to write a one-page artists' statement describing their work and rationale. It is highly recommended that teachers create their own rubrics for this assignment and distribute them to students at the onset.
5. To start this project, have students spend the remainder of the class drafting an outline of their project and researching other Afrofuturist art that might serve as a source of inspiration. Be sure to remind students to consider how they want to develop the project. For example, will they create a digital or hard-copy zine or comic book?
6. For homework, have students complete their outlines.
Day 4

1. Start class by showcasing what art materials students will have access to (i.e., markers, construction paper, cardstock, color pencils, rulers, felt tip pens, graphics software, etc.) in order to complete their project.
2. After students have completed their projects, dedicate a final class day for sharing and reflection. Have each student place their work on display around the classroom. Allow students to walk around and examine their peer's projects for 15�20 minutes.
3. After perusing the projects on display, have each student briefly present their artists' statement aloud to the entire class.
4. Students then prepare a brief reflection on their key takeaways from the lesson overall as well as their experience creating Afrofuturist inspired projects and viewing the creations of their classmates.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will complete a pre and post written reflection on their understanding of Afrofuturism.
 Students will analyze cultural texts.  Students will actively think about how Afrofuturism is being engaged as an analytic
framework for reimagining systems of power.  Students will complete a culminating project where they are responsible for creating a
cultural text that engages Afrofuturism.

Distribute one of the five informational texts (links listed at the end of unit under "Lesson One Materials/Resources) to each student in the small groups of five. Each student will read and annotate one of the texts for important ideas and record key ideas in the "Four I's of Oppression: El Salvador Day One Document." When sharing ideas, each group member should teach the other group members about the content and discuss the type of oppression in their respective article. 5. Ask students to collaborate to answer the following two discussion questions. Ask one member from each of the groups to present the group response:
1. What did you appreciate about this lesson? 2. What new insights do you have about immigration to the United States?
Day Two: Youth Scholars Teach US Immigration Policy Shifts to the People
In this activity, students will investigate how US immigration policies evolved in response to historical events. Small groups will be assigned to research one of five shifts in immigration policy and collaborate to create presentation slides on the new policy.
1. Distribute the Push and Pull Factors Activity handout to students. Instruct students to work independently first to rank the factors in terms of which have historically been the three most significant push and pull factors prompting immigration to the United States. They must then select the top three most significant current push and pull factors and explain why they choose those factors.
2. Once students have determined their rankings, group them in fours and instruct them to compare their rankings, and to try to come to a consensus on the top three factors for each as a group. Instruct each group to share their top factors for each with the class, and then facilitate a short discussion, noting similarities and differences between each group's answers while asking probing questions to get students to support their arguments with evidence.
3. Inform students that they will be learning about how the actual immigration system determines who is able to immigrate and who isn't. They will work in small groups to research one of six immigration policies beginning with the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1965. Distribute the Immigration Presentation Assignment Sheet and explain

the expectations to students. (For more background on the racist origins of the Immigration Act of 1924 you can read with students "DACA, The 1924 Immigration Act, and American Exclusion" in the Huffington Post, https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dacathe-1924-immigration-act-and-american-exclusion_b_59b1650ee4b0bef3378cde32). 4. Next, assign students to small groups to research one of the six policies regulating the American immigration system since 1965. 5. Have students start their research by reading the relevant section of Juan's story on the tab marked "US Immigration: A Policy in Flux" to get basic background overview of their assigned policy (https://www.centralamericanstories.com/characters/juan/#top). Directions for which paragraph of "A Policy in Flux" to read for each topic are in parenthesis behind the topic title on the assignment sheet. Additional links are provided for each of the other topics, but students can research additional online resources to create their presentations. 6. Instruct students to use the Immigration Presentation Assignment Sheet to prepare the research for presentation on a slide presentation program. Have students analyze which of the Four I's of Oppression explain the implementation of the immigration policy and include it in the slides presentation. 7. Have students refer back to the opening activity and ask which of the factors determining immigration preference influenced each of the policies. Naturally, this will lead to a discussion of whether the United States is implementing a fair and principled immigration policy. 8. Students may investigate how local communities are affected by immigration policies and what institutions are being used to support current immigration policies and practices. At the same time, students may examine what resources are available for those afflicted by current policies.

Instructions: Which texts go with each type of oppression? Write the name of the text in the correct oppression box and explain the connection.
Four I's of Oppression Student Answer
Ideological Oppression [student response]
The idea that one group is better than another, and has the right to control the "other" group. The idea that one group is more intelligent, more advanced, more deserving, superior, and hold more power. The very intentional ideological development of the ...isms Examples: dominant narratives, "Othering."

Institutional Oppression [student response]
The network of institutional structures, policies, and practices that create advantages and benefits for some, and discrimination, oppression, and disadvantages for others. (Institutions are the organized bodies such as companies, governmental bodies, prisons, schools, non-governmental organizations, families, and religious institutions, among others).

Interpersonal Oppression

[student response]

The idea that one group is better than another and has the right to control the other, which gets structured into institutions, gives permission and reinforcement for individual members of the dominant group to personally disrespect or mistreat individuals in the oppressed group. Interpersonal racism is racism that occurs between individuals. Examples of interpersonal racism include the following��what some members of a racial group do to members of a different racial group up close��racist jokes, stereotypes, beatings and harassment, threats, etc.

Similarly, interpersonal sexism is sexism that occurs between people. Examples of man to woman interpersonal sexism may include the following��sexual abuse and harassment, violence directed at women, belittling or ignoring women's thinking, sexist jokes, etc. Many people in each dominant group are not consciously oppressive. They have internalized the negative messages about other groups, and consider their attitudes towards other groups quite normal.

[student response continued]

Internalized Oppression [student response]
The process by which a member of an oppressed group comes to accept and live out the inaccurate myths and stereotypes applied to the group by its oppressors. Internalized oppression means the oppressor doesn't have to exert any more pressure, because we now do it to ourselves and each other. Oppressed people internalize the ideology of inferiority, the see it reflected in the institutions, they experience mistreatment interpersonally from members of the dominant group, and they eventually come to internalize the negative messages about themselves.

Timeline Document for group presentations Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
1. Students will represent their mastery of the lesson objectives via group presentations based on the knowledge gained from each day's activities.
2. Students will research various US immigration policies. Students will demonstrate knowledge of the policies and how they affect immigrants by preparing a slide presentation.
Sample Lesson 13: US Undocumented Immigrants from Mexico and Beyond: Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles
Theme: Systems of Power Disciplinary Area: Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 5 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 1, 2, 4; Historical Interpretation 1 and 4 CCSS ELA-LITERACY: RH. 9�10. 2�5, 8; WHST.9�10. 1, 2, 4 CA CCSS ELD Standards: ELD. PI. 9�10. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6a, 10 Lesson Purpose and Overview: The lesson is applicable to many US urban areas but is written specifically about the Los Angeles Boyle Heights area. Some students in urban working-class communities have been impacted by gentrification (the process of upgrading a neighborhood while pushing out working class communities), the growing housing crisis, and being undocumented/DACAmented.

Consequently, many families have experienced detention and deportation, while others express growing concerns of being pushed out of their community altogether.
This lesson introduces students to the plight of undocumented immigrants, gentrification in the greater Los Angeles area, cultural preservation vs. assimilation, and Greek mythology and tragedy. Students will learn about the use of immigrant laborers for the construction and garment industry; the impact of drug cartels and lack of opportunities in Mexico and how that factors into people's decision to emigrate; and how contemporary playwrights of color are leveraging ancient literature and theatre to discuss modern-day issues.
Key Terms and Concepts: colonialism, cultural preservation, assimilation, gentrification, undocumented, patriarchy, machismo, barrios
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. develop an understanding about the process of migration, assimilation, cultural preservation, and gentrification;
2. engage key English language arts content, such as literary and dramatic devices; and
3. explain how organizing and advocacy counteract institutional racism as it relates to housing and immigration.
Essential Questions:
1. What is gentrification and why is it disproportionately impacting communities of color? What are the short and long term effects on communities of color?
2. How and why were barrios created? How did it influence the identity and experiences of the communities living there?
3. Why do indigenous populations from Mexico and Latin America migrate to the US? What are the push and pull factors? To what extent has migration been a positive/negative experience for these populations?
Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. Begin the lesson by posting the definition to bruja, chisme, curandera, El Guaco, migra,
mojada, and N�huatl[1] on the board. Provide definitions of multiculturalism and assimilation
or provide time for students to research these topics. Discuss the similarities and differences between the two. Also provide a compare and contrast chart of the ancient Greek playwright, Euripides, and the contemporary Xicanx playwright Luis Alfaro--author of Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles. In this introduction, thoroughly cover the tenets of Greek mythology and tragedy, the traditional roles of women in Ancient Greece, the garment industry in Los Angeles, the use of immigrant labor to construct the edifices of gentrification development, and drug cartels in the Mexican state of Michoac�n.
a. If available, consult with the English Department of your site to collaborate on a reader's theatre approach to the play Mojada: A Medea in Los Angeles. Students could be provided time to engage the play in both classes.
2. Following the in-class readings, ask the students to reflect on the characters and their relationship to immigration, gentrification and cultural preservation vs. assimilation. Later divide students into small groups where they are tasked with responding to the following questions. The questions can be divided equally per group, or the teacher can choose to focus on some of them as time allows.
a. Have students take 5�10 minutes to research online the definition of tragic hero. After completing this task, ask the students to respond to the following questions: (1) To what extent does Medea fit the definition of a tragic hero? (2) What is her tragic flaw? (3) What does Medea learn from her journey? (4) What does the audience learn from her journey?
b. At the beginning of the play, Tita says that being in the United States is Hason's dream. What is his dream? How do Medea and Acan fit into his dream? What is Medea's dream?
c. Refer to your research on multiculturalism vs. assimilation. Which characters are able to assimilate to living in the United States? What are the benefits for characters that are able to assimilate? Which characters are not able to? What is the cost of their inability to assimilate? Which characters are able to be in the United States and still maintain their native culture?

d. Have students find Michoac�n and Boyle Heights using print or electronic maps. How is the physical environment of Michoac�n different from that of Boyle Heights? Why can't Medea leave her yard? What role does Medea's environment play in her inability to assimilate?
e. In what ways are Medea and her family in exile? How does immigration and specifically the idea of exile help the audience understand Medea's journey in the play?
f. What abilities does Medea possess that keep her connected to her Mexican culture? In what ways does this connection conflict with Hason and Acan's desires to fit in and become "American"?
g. What is Hason willing to do to achieve success in the United States? Does he make those choices for his family or for personal fulfillment? What are the consequences of his ambition?
h. In what way does the assault Medea experienced during her journey affect her ability to adjust and thrive in the United States? When accosted by the soldiers at the border why does Medea sacrifice herself? How does Medea's sacrifice affect her relationship with Hason?
i. Compare and contrast Medea, Armida, and Josefina. What were their journeys to get to the United States? How does each react to being in a new country? In what ways does each woman's choices bring them success? What is the cost of some of their choices?
j. Refer to your research on and discussion of multiculturalism and assimilation. What comparisons do Medea, Tita, Josefina, and Armida make between Mexico and United States? In what ways is the love of their culture and Mexican way of life seen as anti-American and by whom? How does each character reconcile the division they experience between old and new worlds, if at all?
k. In what ways is Euripides' Medea hindered by a male-dominant society? In what ways is Alfaro's Medea hindered by a male-dominant society? How do Tita, Josefina, and Armida work with or against their gender roles to survive and achieve success?

In what ways is Hason privileged by these traditional gender roles? In what ways is he hindered by traditional expectations?
l. In what ways is Acan torn between the old world of his mother and the new world his father has decided to embrace? In what ways does he contribute to Medea taking vengeance?
m. How does the revelation of Medea's circumstances in Mexico and the reason for leaving heighten the stakes surrounding the eviction from her apartment? What is Medea running from and why? What does her past tell us about her in the present?
n. Why does Medea refer to herself as a mojada or wetback with Armida? In what ways does she believe she is a mojada? In what ways does she not? What is the significance of the title, Mojada: A Relocation of Medea?
o. What events contribute to Medea taking vengeance on Hason and Armida? In what ways does the story of Medea's life in Michoac�n contribute to her killing Armida and Acan? Why does Medea kill Acan?
p. Who has betrayed Medea in Mexico and in the US, and in what ways? What effect do these betrayals have on her? How do the betrayals contribute to her actions at the end of the play?
q. Refer to on the definition of el guaco provided at the beginning of the lesson. In what ways is Medea like el guaco? What becomes of Medea at the end of the play? What could her final transformation symbolize?
r. If you are seeing Julius Caesar, compare and contrast what Brutus and Medea want to pass on to the next generation versus Hason and Caesar. In what ways is violence a part of the legacies of Brutus and Medea? In what ways is it a part of Hason and Caesar's legacies? How do Hason and Caesar contribute to their own downfalls? What other actions could Brutus have taken toward Caesar and Medea toward Hason?
3. Have students demonstrate their knowledge by developing and delivering a brief presentation that highlights the concepts learned from the play to current topics of immigration and gentrification in their respective communities.

Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the English Language Arts/English Language Development (ELA/ELD) Framework: These two curriculum frameworks contain an extensive lesson example that shows how teachers can work with colleagues across disciplines to address a common topic. In this case, the example is how a language arts teacher and history�social science teacher collaborate to teach the novel Things Fall Apart, addressing both language arts and history�social science standards in their instruction (the example begins on page 338 in the History�Social Science Framework, and page 744 of the ELA/ELD Framework). Ethnic studies educators should also consider how they can collaborate with their peers to integrate ethnic studies instruction with content in other areas. Depending on which grade level the ethnic studies course is being offered, the ethnic studies educator can include a literary selection that connects to the content students are studying in their history�social science classroom, or work with the language arts teacher on lessons that address grade-level standards in reading or writing.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: � Students will work in groups to analyze and discuss the text while responding to the provided questions. � Students deliver a presentation to an authentic audience that connects the play to experiences in their communities.

Sample Lesson 14: The East L.A. Blowouts: An Anchor to the Chicano Movement
Theme: Social Movements and Equity

Disciplinary Area: Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 4, 5, 6, 7
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1-3; Historical Interpretation 1, 3, 4
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH. 9�10. 2, 3, 4; WHST. 9�10. 4, 8, 9
CA ELD Standards: ELD. PI. 9�10. 1, 2, 5, 6a, 9
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson will introduce students to the East Los Angeles Student blowouts (or walkouts) of 1968 and the Chicano Movement. They will have an opportunity to explore the range of student response to discrimination and injustices that were manifesting in public education. At the onset, students will engage in critical dialogue and inquiry about early Chicana/o/x youth and social movements, and conclude the lesson by drawing connections to current injustices and issues confronting Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Americans in schools.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. gain a better understanding of root causes of protests, revolutions, and uprisings; and 2. articulate the history of the East Los Angeles student blowouts and the Chicano
Movement, with a focus on key leaders, movement demands, and outcomes.
Essential Questions:
1. How did the students from East Los Angeles respond to discrimination and injustice within the educational system, and to what extent did it lead to change?
2. How were the East Los Angeles blowouts and the broader Chicano Movement connected to the same root causes?
3. How is transformative social change possible when working within existing institutions, like the public school system?
4. What is the role of education and who should have the power to shape what is taught?

Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Open the class by displaying the following excerpt from the Los Angeles Times article, "East L.A., 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement:
"LOS ANGELES -- Teachers at Garfield High School were winding down classes before lunch. Then they heard the startling sound of people running the halls, pounding on classroom doors. `Walkout' they were shouting. `Walkout!'
Students left classrooms and gathered in front of the school entrance. They held their clenched fists high. `Viva la revoluci�n!' they called out. `Education, not eradication!'
It was just past noon on a sunny Tuesday, March 5, 1968 -- the day a revolution began for Mexican-Americans, people whose families came to the United States from Mexico."
2. Proceed to ask students why they think students at Garfield were shouting "Walkout," and what do the phrases "Viva la revoluci�n!" and "Education, not eradication!" mean? In pairs, students discuss the above questions, later sharing their thoughts with the entire class. Following discussion, provide definitions for the following terms: protest, eradication, revoluci�n, uprising, Chicano, Brown Berets, and unrest. Then instruct students to read, "East L.A. 1968: `Walkout!' The day high school students helped ignite the Chicano power movement".
3. After giving students about 15 minutes to read the article and discuss their immediate reactions in think, pair, and share formats, proceed to write down any questions students may have about the article on the board and respond to them. 1. To supplement the article, play a short video clip on the youth movement, "The 1968 student walkout that galvanized a national movement for Chicano rights."
4. Following the screening, lead a discussion about how the students experienced police aggression and were even targeted with federal charges for "invoking riots." Be sure to emphasize that the students were resilient and persisted in other forms of protest by organizing their peers and parents, and attending school board meetings where they presented a list of demands.
5. Hand each pair a copy of the two primary sources listed below.

"Student Walkout Demands," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) Board of Education
No student or teacher will be reprimanded or suspended for participating in any efforts which are executed for the purpose of improving or furthering the educational quality in our schools.
Bilingual-Bi-cultural education will be compulsory for Mexican-Americans in the Los Angeles City School System where there is a majority of Mexican-American students. This program will be open to all other students on a voluntary basis.
In-service education programs will be instituted immediately for all staff in order to teach them the Spanish language and increase their understanding of the history, traditions, and contributions of the Mexican culture.
All administrators in the elementary and secondary schools in these areas will become proficient in the Spanish language. Participants are to be compensated during the training period at not less than $8.80 an hour and upon completion of the course will receive in addition to their salary not less than $100.00 a month. The monies for these programs will come from local funds, state funds and matching federal funds.
Administrators and teachers who show any form of prejudice toward Mexican or Mexican-American students, including failure to recognize, understand, and appreciate Mexican culture and heritage, will be removed from East Los Angeles schools. This will be decided by a Citizens Review Board selected by the Educational Issues Committee.
Textbooks and curriculum will be developed to show Mexican and Mexican-American contribution to the U.S. society and to show the injustices that Mexicans have suffered as a culture of that society. Textbooks should concentrate on Mexican folklore rather than English folklore.
All administrators where schools have majority of Mexican-American descent shall be of Mexican- American descent. If necessary, training programs should be instituted to provide a cadre of Mexican-American administrators.
Every teacher's ratio of failure per students in his classroom shall be made available to community groups and students. Any teacher having a particularly high percentage of

the total school dropouts in his classes shall be rated by the Citizens Review Board composed of the Educational Issues Committee.
"Student Rights," proposal drafted by high school students of East Los Angeles to the Board of Education:
Corporal punishment will only be administrated according to State Law.
Teachers and administrators will be rated by the students at the end of each semester.
Students should have access to any type of literature and should be allowed to bring it on campus.
Students who spend time helping teachers shall be given monetary and/or credit compensation.
Students will be allowed to have guest speakers to club meetings. The only regulation should be to inform the club sponsor.
Dress and grooming standards will be determined by a group of a) students and b) parents.
Student body offices shall be open to all students. A high-grade point average shall not be considered as a pre-requisite to eligibility.
Entrances to all buildings and restrooms should be accessible to all students during school hours. Security can be enforced by designated students.
Student menus should be Mexican oriented. When Mexican food is served, mothers from the barrios should come to the school and help supervise the preparation of the food. These mothers will meet the food handler requirements of Los Angeles City Schools and they will be compensated for their services.
School janitorial services should be restricted to the employees hired for that purposes by the school board. Students will [not] be punished by picking up paper or trash and keeping them out of class.
Only area superintendents can suspend students.

6. After reading the primary source documents, proceed to have the pairs construct what their own demands would be if they were to organize a presentation to the Board of Education on flip chart paper. Once the pairs have completed their own demands, then task the students with responding to the following reflection questions related to the primary sources listed above: 1. What student demand do you think is the most important, and why? 2. What is one student right you would add to this list? 3. Which student rights and/or demands do you view as less important, and why? 4. The East Los Angeles Walkouts were led by students. Do you think they would've been more effective if they had been led by teachers or other adults? Why or why not? 5. What do you think happened after the East Los Angeles Walkouts? 6. What is happening in the US currently that relates to the 1968 East Los Angeles Walkouts? 7. What other youth-led movements have occurred within contemporary US history? 8. Beyond walkouts, what are other ways students can best advocate for themselves?
7. Finally, each pair is given the opportunity to present their proposed student demands and response to question number eight to the entire class.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will show understanding of the content by discussing and responding to the questions provided.
 Students will create a presentation of demands on how to improve schools in their district.

Sample Lesson 15: Hmong Americans--Community, Struggle, Voice
Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4 Standards Alignment: HSS Content Standard 11.11.1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

Overview: Hmong Americans are seen as Asian Americans, yet they have a very unique experience and history in the US. The goal of this lesson is to delve deeply into their experience and understand their formation as a community and as a voice within American society. This lesson uses the voices of Hmong women, men, girls, and boys, as well as an article from the Amerasia Journal to create an understanding of the issues and experiences of the Hmong American Community.
Key Terms and Concepts: Hmong, oral history, Laos, CIA, Refugee Resettlement Act of 1980, Asian American, Secret War in Laos, Patriarchy
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� better understand the diversity of experiences of Hmong Americans by engaging a range of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, poems, and scholarly articles; and
� write their own spoken word piece about their lived experiences. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure poetry, as well as techniques for performing.
Essential Questions:
1. What is the history of Hmong immigration to the US? 2. How did first generation Hmong immigrants' experiences differ from their children who
were born in the US? How did gender factor into differing experiences?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1��Hmong Immigrant Experience and Hmong Americans
1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone here has experiences or a personal identity that they feel could help others better understand this content, feel free, but not required, to add to our discussions."
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about the Hmong in America and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about the Hmong. The teacher asks students what type of information would be useful in learning more about the Hmong community and writes the answers on the white board.

4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong community in the US. Alternate choral reading��teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts. Quick Fact Sheet attached.
5. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Hmong experience in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a video interview of a Hmong couple who immigrated to the US. Note that the videos have subtitles and that students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured to get to the U.S as they watch the video. Teachers should tell students that the following videos can be traumatizing for some. After each video the teacher can provide students time to process the information they saw through discussion and reflection that is facilitated by the teacher.
"Starting Again in the Refugee Camp" is a short documentary about Pang Ge Yang and Mee Lee. An incredible story of Love, Loss and Hope. At the end of the Secret War, Pang Ge Yang escapes from Laos into Thailand. Through the harsh journey through the jungle, Pang Ge's pregnant wife dies, and he is unable to leave her body for three days. Mee Lee also is fleeing war torn Laos, and her husband dies during the escape. Mee found herself as a near death, broken widow in the Thailand refugee camps. After losing everything, a miracle happens and these two widows find each other and a new reason for life again in each other. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDWU5zP-B6g (9 mins)
7. As homework, students can conduct research on outstanding questions from the first activity of the lesson.
Day 2��Compare and Contrast of Genders in the Hmong Community
8. The teacher shows two spoken word poems of two teenage Hmong females. As students watch them, they should think about how these individuals have developed their identity as being Hmong American. As students watch, they should consider what it is like to be a young Hmong American woman. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6XxuyYI6ho
9. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (How do these poets describe their

experiences and young Hmong-American women?) for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Being caught between two worlds, with their parents and the pressures of American society, language barrier with parents, and not fully accepted into the American society
� The frustration they feel not being appreciated for being Hmong but rather being called Chinese or from Hong Kong
� Living in a patriarchy, family expectations, and family hypocrisies
� Feeling like they need more support to succeed in school but failing to receive that support within the American education system
� Feeling proud to be Hmong and a daughter
� Learning how to embrace their heritage and culture but at the same time pursue their dreams of going to college
� Developing an identity of their own as proud Hmong Americans
10. Have students read an excerpt from "Criminalization and Second Generation of Hmong American Boys." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Hmong American male? (pages 113�116, "Criminalization and Second Generation Hmong American Boys" by Bao Lo.) 1. As students read the article, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text. Annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text. 2. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Bao Lo, what is it like to be a young Hmong American male? 3. Some important things to point out in the discussion:

i. Similar to young African American and Latino males, young Hmong males are thought of as gangsters, dropouts, and delinquents by some law enforcement and authority figures.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding incarceration and criminalization in research and public policy shows a need to understand it better.
iii. Teachers often treat the dress of baggy clothing, quietness, and swaggering of the Hmong boys as deviant.
iv. This implicit bias among authority members leads to racial profiling of Hmong boys and leads to the boys feeling of isolation and frustration.
v. The criminalization of men and boys of color goes hand in hand with the decriminalization of white males. As a result ,white criminality is less controlled, surveilled, and punished while black, Latino, and Southeast Asian criminality is treated as threatening and in need of punishment.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework includes a description of the impact of the Vietnam War, including the experiences of refugees. On pages 423�425 there is a classroom example where students study the impact of the war on the United States. You can extend this context to this lesson by asking students to research the following questions:
� How did the Vietnam War affect Hmong immigration to the United States?
� How the experience of the war affect perceptions of Hmong immigrants?
11. Assessment��To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments: 1. Write a paragraph of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or 2. Write a spoken word poem expressing your identity.

Quick Fact Sheet about the Hmong in the US
� The Hmong are an ethnic group that lives in the mountains primarily in southern China, Laos, Burma, northern Vietnam and Thailand. They are a subgroup of the Miao ethnic group and have more than one dialect within and among the different Hmong communities. � During the Vietnam War, Laos also experienced a civil war in which three princes sought control over the Royal Lao government. One of the princes sought support from the Vietnamese communists, while the other sought support from the US. Both sides swept in and recruited Hmong to join their military forces. � The most successful was the Royal Lao government, which was backed by the US CIA.

� In 1961, 18,000 young Hmong men joined the US-backed armies in the Secret War in Laos with the promise that the Royal Lao government and the US would take care of them if Laos fell to the communists.
� When Vietnam and Laos fell to the communists in 1973, the Hmong were persecuted by the communists, causing most to flee their homeland. The majority crossed the Mekong River and made their way to Thailand to live in refugee camps.
� Several families stayed in these camps for years until being processed and either returned to their home countries or sent to the US.
� The US refugee resettlement Act of 1980 brought in over 200,000 Hmong families to live in cities spread across the US from 1980 to 2000.
� Over the years, the Hmong migrated to specific Hmong ethnic enclaves within US cities within California, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.
� From the mid-1980s to 2000s there has been a gradual rise in undergraduate college enrollment particularly in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and California. This has led to college courses on Hmong language and Hmong American history and culture.
� Today there are large Hmong communities in Fresno, St. Paul, Minneapolis, Sacramento, Merced, Milwaukee, Wausau, and Green Bay, with the total population over 300,000.
� The Hmong have played a key role in helping the farm communities grow and flourish.
� The rich Hmong culture involved embroidery, story clothes, ghost stories, and many rituals.
� Although the Hmong fall under the category of Asian American in the US, they endure one of the highest poverty rates at 37.8 in 2004 among all ethnic groups so they do not receive the services they need because they have been lumped into the Asian American group, which is an aggregate of more than 25 ethnic groups that have diverse histories and experiences in the United States.
� The Hmong struggle with the dual identities of being labeled as the Model Minority or as criminals for the young males.

4. Following the film, divide the students into groups of four to five. Each group is given 20 minutes to read the following excerpt, discuss the film, respond to the aforementioned guiding questions, and come up with definitions for the terms listed above.

5. Excerpt from Our Stories in Our Voices "Filipinos and Mexicans for the United Farm Workers Union" by James Sobredo:

a. By the 1950s and 1960s, the remaining Filipinos in the United States are now much older. They were also working side-by-side with other Mexican farm workers. Then in 1965, under the leadership of Larry Itliong, Filipinos went on strike for better salaries and working conditions in Delano. Itliong had been a long-time labor union organizer, but although they won strikes in the past, they had never been able to gain recognition as a union for farm workers. To make matters worse, when Filipinos went on strike, Mexican farm workers were brought in by the farmers to break the strike; in the same way, when Mexican farm workers went on strike, Filipinos were brought in to break their strike. Itliong recognized this problem, so he asked Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta, who had been organizing Mexican farm workers, to meet with him. Itliong asked Chavez to join the Filipino grape strike, but Cesar refused because he did not feel that they were ready. It was Huerta, who had known Itliong when she lived and worked in Stockton, who convinced Chavez to join the Filipino strike. Thus, for the first time in history, Filipinos and Mexicans joined forces and had a unified strike for union recognition and workers' rights. This led to the establishment of the United Farm Workers union (UFW), which brought together the Filipino workers of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) and the Mexican workers of the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) in a joint strike.

One of the important labor actions the UFW did to gather support for the Grape Strike was a 300-mile march from the UFW headquarters in Delano in the Central Valley to the State Capitol in Sacramento. The march started on March 17, 1966, when 75 Filipino and Mexican farm workers started their long trek down from Delano, taking country roads close to Highway 99, all the way up to Sacramento. They were stopping and spending the night at small towns along the way, giving speeches, theater performances, and singing songs. They were following the tradition of nonviolent protests started by Mahatma Gandhi in India and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the South. The march to Sacramento was very successful. By the time, the Filipinos and Mexicans arrived in Sacramento, they were now 10,000 marchers strong, and the march brought more media coverage and national support to the UFW grape strike...
The connection to the Filipino and Mexican farmworkers remains a strong thread in the California Assembly. Rob Bonta (Democrat, 18 District) is the first Filipino American Assembly member to be elected to office. He is the son of Filipino labor union organizers and grew up in La Paz, in Kern County, in a "trailer just a few hundred yards from Cesar Chavez's home." His parents were civil rights activists and labor union organizers who worked with the UFW to organize Filipino and Mexican farm workers...
6. While students are working in groups, write down the eight key terms on the white board, leaving plenty room between each. After the time has expired, signal to students that it is time to come back together. Facilitate a discussion where students are able to respond to each of the guiding questions aloud. Finally, ask one member from each group to go to the board. Each student is assigned a word and is expected to write their definition of the word with their group's support. After completing this task, the class talks through each term. Provide additional information, examples, and support to better clarify and define the terms.
7. Close with student and community reflection.
Day 2
1. Bring to class a carton of strawberries and grapes, several pieces of sugar cane, and a few asparagus spears. Engage the class by asking how many students have ever

worked on a farm or have grown their own food? Then ask if anyone knows how the food items brought in are grown and/or harvested? Let students know that the food items brought in are among some of the most labor-intensive to harvest, are in high demand, and are largely hand-picked or cut by often underpaid farm workers. Proceed to display images detailing the process of each crop being harvested. Be sure to highlight that farm labor is often repetitive and menial, yet damaging to the body. After completing this overview, allow the students to eat the food items brought in.

2. After the discussion about harvesting crops, play "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun," a song by Daniel Valdez that was popularized during the United Farm Workers Movement. After listening to the song, ask students what the song is about? Allow for about 10 minutes of discussion followed by an overview on protest songs and music that were played/sung while Filipino and Mexican workers toiled the fields and during protests. The overview should foreground the Filipino contribution in the UFW, like the book Journey for Justice: The Life of Larry Itliong. Then proceed to describe how protest and work songs provided a unifying message, energized crowds during rallies and marches, and helped amplify dissent.

3. Following this overview, divide students into pairs. Each pair is then assigned a protest or work song from the list below (students also have the option to create their own protest song):

a. "Brown-Eyed Children of the Sun" by Daniel Valdez, Sylvia Galan, and Pedro Contreras

b. "Huelga En General" / "General Strike" by Luis Valdez

c. "El Esquirol" / "The Scab" by Teatro Campesino

d. No Nos Mover�n

e. "Pastures of Plenty" by Woody Guthrie

f.

"Solidaridad (Pa) Para Siempre" (Solidarity forever)

g. "Nosotros Venceremos" (We shall overcome)

4. Let the pairs know that they will be responsible for completing a two-page cultural analysis essay that must address the following steps and prompts:
a. Find the lyrics and an audio recording of your assigned song.
b. Analyze the song and identify three to five key themes or points.
c. What is the purpose and/or meaning of this song?
d. Who is the intended audience?
e. What types of instruments, sounds, poetic devices, etc., are used?
f. How does this song situate within the history of Filipino farm workers and the broader United Farm workers' movement?
5. Allow the pairs to use the remainder of the class period to listen to their songs and take notes. In addition, students can invite other classes and have a listening party. Give the students ample time in class for the next two days to work on their essays. During those days offer writing support, carving out time to help each pair craft their thesis statement, core arguments, and better structure their essays overall.
6. On the final day, each pair exchanges their essay with another pair. The pairs are given 15 minutes to conduct a brief peer review of each essay. After the review, have a "listening party." The entire class is given the opportunity to listen to the various songs. After each song is played, the pair that wrote an essay on the song and the pair that reviewed the song are able to briefly share their thoughts and analysis of the cultural text to the class.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
Students will complete a cultural analysis essay where they are expected to analyze protest songs (or other cultural texts) that were assigned to them in class. Their analysis should include themes that emerged in the songs, connecting them back to the history, struggles, tactics, leaders, and goals of the UFW.

Sample Lesson 17: Chinese Railroad Workers
Theme: Systems of Power Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4 Standards Alignment: HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 2; Historical Interpretation 1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 6, 9, SL.9�10.1.A, 1.B, 1.C.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
The contributions of people of color to the development of the economic development and infrastructure of the United States are too often minimized or overlooked. Chinese Americans are Americans and have played a key role in building this country. Had it not been for this work force, one of the greatest engineering feats of the nineteenth century (the railroad), would not have been built within the allotted timeline. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have played an integral part as active labor organizers and strikers throughout history to fight racism and exploitation. The image of the transcontinental railroads meeting at Promontory Point on May 10, 1869, with no Chinese workers exemplifies the white supremacy view of US history.
Key Terms and Concepts: systems of power, assimilate, transcontinental, Central Pacific Railroad Company (CPRR), congenial, amassed, worker exploitation
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. understand how Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been active labor organizers and strikers throughout history to fight racism and exploitation;
2. develop an appreciation for the contributions of Chinese Americans to US history and infrastructure; and
3. students will develop their speaking skills through a Socratic seminar discussion.
Essential Questions:
1. How have Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) responded to repressive conditions in US history?
2. What role have AAPIs played in the labor movement?
3. Why is it important to recognize the contributions of immigrant labor in building the wealth of the United States?
4. Why is it important to remember the Chinese Railroad Strike?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Overview:

Day 1 � Transcontinental Railroad and Chinese Immigration Day 2 � Chinese Labor and the Building of the Transcontinental Railroad Day 3 � Commemoration of the Golden Spike
Detailed Daily Lesson Procedures Day 1 � Transcontinental Railroad and Chinese Immigration
1. Post the image of a Chinese railroad worker on the screen.
a. Students are asked to estimate when the photo was taken, who is shown in the photo, and what historical event or events they think are connected to the photograph.
b. Teacher will ask students what they know about Chinese Americans and their contributions to the US.
2. Introduce the lesson with the key overarching questions:
a. To what extent did immigrant labor contribute to building the wealth of the US?
b. To what extent did those laborers benefit from the wealth they helped build? 3. Read "The Chinese Experience in 19th Century America � Background for Teachers" and the "Chinese Railroad Workers in North America Project" at Stanford University.
a. Have students read in pairs using any reading strategy for the level of the class (annotation, mark the text, Cornell notes, choral reading, etc.) b. Respond to Key Questions and answer the questions on the students' handout (see attached). Day 2 � Chinese Labor and the Building of the Transcontinental Railroad
1. Teacher discusses the answers to the questions students have completed and asks the questions:

a. To what extent have Chinese Railroad workers been given credit for their contribution to the building of the transcontinental railroad?
b. Have students look up "transcontinental railroad" in the index of their US History textbook and have them look for text on Chinese laborers.
2. Show on the screen the image of the May 10, 1869, Promontory Point celebration.
3. Have students analyze the photograph.
a. Who is featured in the photo? Where and when was the photo taken? Why was the photo taken?
b. Who is not featured in the photo? Why do you think that is?
4. Show video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQUP8-DJpMsandt=6s. Tell the students to pay special attention to Connie Young Yu's interview from 1:59�2:31. The whole video is 5:31 minutes.
5. Provide students time to reflect on what they have seen in the video by having students complete a five-minute free-write brainstorm on the following questions: Based on the interviews in the video, why is it important to recognize the contributions of Chinese laborers? Why is that recognition meaningful to people within the Chinese-American community? How does the exclusion of Chinese and Chinese-American contributions to the United States, including the railroad, affect our understanding of history?
6. After students have completed their free-write, have students assemble in pairs or groups of three. Have students share their responses with one another. When the discussion begins to wind down, have the class reconvene as a whole group. Have students share their thoughts and ideas with the whole class.
7. Tell students that this video shows the importance of recognizing the contributions of Chinese laborers more than one hundred years after the building of the railroad. Ask students these final questions: How do you think Chinese laborers and Chinese immigrants were treated at the time? Provide students with copies of excerpts from David Phillips' discussion of "The Chinese Question," Edward Holton's observations about Dennis Kearney, and "Enactments So Utterly Un-American" by Constance Gordon-Cumming. As students read, have them identify the

conflicting attitudes towards the presence of Chinese laborers in California, noting the arguments presented for the exclusion and inclusion of Chinese laborers.
8. After students have read the document excerpts, explain to students that the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Have students look up this event in their textbooks and discuss with a partner whether or not they think the information provided is satisfactory. Have students come up with a list of questions they have about the Chinese Exclusion Act.
Day 3 � Taking Action
Every year on May 10, the Golden Spike Foundation commemorates the coming together of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads to create the Transcontinental Railroad. Every year, there is little to no representation of the Chinese laborers who have built the central pacific railroad.
1. Show video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttuDlv3bST4, ask students to focus on the contributions and hardships experienced by Chinese laborers while building through the Sierras.
2. Split students into groups and have them brainstorm a list of ways that the Golden Spike Foundation could recognize the contributions of Chinese laborers and how they can increase awareness of their contributions. Then, compose a professional, persuasive letter to the committee that explains why the Chinese contributions to the railroad should be recognized and how that can be achieved. Include concrete information from the resources you have examined over the course of this lesson, including specific quotes and examples.
Address your letter to the Golden Spike Foundation, 60 South 600 East, Suite 150, Salt Lake City, Utah 84102.

Sample Lesson 18: Historical and Contemporary Experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States
Theme: History and Movement, Identity Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 3, 4 Standards Alignment: HSS Content Standards: 11.4.2 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 6, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1, SL.11�12.4. Lesson Purpose and Overview: This lesson is designed to be an introduction to the study of people of Pacific Islander descent in the United States, while drawing connections to the Pacific Islands and the Pacific Island diaspora more broadly. Pacific Islanders in the United States are often left out of conversations about communities of color in America. The purpose of this lesson is to understand the ways in which American expansion in the Pacific since the 1800s has grown and created a variety of issues among growing Pacific Islander communities in Oceania and in the US today. This lesson will use geography, data aggregation, and narratives to explore the US experiences of

Pacific Islanders from Guam, American Samoa, Palau, Marshall Islands, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. This lesson is designed to be an introduction to the study of Pacific Islander migrations to the continental United States, including the history, culture, and politics of Hawai'i and US Pacific territories.
Key Terms and Concepts: Pacific Islanders, race, annexation, migration, militarization, citizenship, Oceania, Melanesia, Micronesia, Polynesia, data disaggregation, Census
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. identify varying experiences of Pacific Islanders in relation to the United States; 2. analyze differences and similarities between Pacific Islander experiences and history;
and 3. explore the relationships between colonialism, citizenship, and identity.
Essential Questions:
1. Who are Pacific Islanders in the United States? What is their history with immigration and settlement?
2. What systems, structures, and events have contributed to the racialization of Pacific Islanders in the US? Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data to understand the Pacific Islander population?
3. What are the contemporary experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States? How do they respond to discrimination and displacement?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day One: Pacific Islander Immigration to the US. Who are Pacific Islanders in the United States? What is their history with immigration and settlement?
1. Students will write down seven words that describe their identity that will be shared later in the lesson.
2. Teacher displays an example of a world map.

3. Teacher will lead a discussion by asking the following questions, writing down student responses:
a. What are maps and what do they tell us?
b. Who and what gets left out of understanding people through maps?
c. What do maps tell us about who created them?
Teacher notes: ex: borders, boundaries, difference, power, etc.
4. Students will answer the question, "How might maps connect to the seven words you chose?," on a piece of paper and then share out to class.
5. Teacher shares examples of maps of the Pacific Islands and explains:
a. The Pacific includes 1200 distinct cultural groups among 7�10 million people living in and around the world's largest and oldest ocean, in some of the world's most vulnerable and precious ecosystems. These groups maintain their respective cultural, political, familial knowledge systems under categories known as Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia (http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/mapsonline/sites/default/files/styles/cartogis_700x700/ public/maps/bitmap/standard/2019/06/00341_Micro%2CMela%2C%20Polynesia.png?itok=0aGPnngd). However, when encountering the US, they are defined by their relationships with maps, borders, and American empire in the Pacific.
Teacher notes:
� Melanesia: Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, and Fiji
� Micronesia: Guam, Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia (Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae), Kiribati, Nauru, Marshall Islands, and Palau

� Polynesia: Hawaiian Islands, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, Tokelau, Wallis and Futuna, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia, Niue, Easter Island, Pitcairn, Norfolk, and New Zealand
6. Teacher displays and explains the "U.S. Immigration Status by Pacific Island Birth" infographic, which shows the varying US immigration statuses of Pacific Islanders that continue to shift over time.
7. Students will share observations of the graphic, while answering the following question: "What do you immediately recognize about the different statuses?"

8. Teacher passes out a worksheet and explains each short write up prior to viewing each video, while students follow along.
a. US Citizens: Hawai'i
i. Hawai'i was colonized by Euro-American capitalists and missionaries in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In 1893 Americans invaded, overthrew Indigenous peoples, and secured an all-white planter oligarchy in place of reigning ali'i (nobility), Queen Lili'uokalani, which led to annexation in 1898. This included dispossession of the Hawaiian government, lands, and citizenship that colonized Indigenous Hawaiians.
ii. Students watch a clip of Act of War (21:45-36:25) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBmrPH1sNqg&t=2917s) and write down 7� 10 explicit details/facts from the video. Teachers can also provide the full documentary online for the students to watch outside of class.
b. Compact of Free Association: Marshall Islands
i. In 1946, the United States started testing nuclear bombs in the Marshall Islands under the codename Operation Crossroads. To clear the way for the tests, the US Navy negotiated with leaders of Bikini Atoll to move 167

residents east to Rongerik Atoll--a move that Bikinians understood as temporary and believed would be "for the good of mankind." When Rongerik's food supply proved insufficient to support the population, the US relocated the Bikinians to Kwajalein Atoll and finally to Kile Island. On Kile, Bikinians faced numerous challenges including insufficient food supplies, lack of fishing grounds, drought, typhoons, dependence on canned food supplied by the US Department of Agriculture, and accompanying health problems (e.g., high blood pressure and diabetes).
ii. Students watch Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner - Anointed (0:00-6:08) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEVpExaY2Fs) and write down 5�7 explicit details/facts from the video.
c. US Nationals: American Samoa
i. In the 1890s, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States were locked in a dispute over who should have control over the Samoan islands. In 1899, these countries came to an agreement where the Germans had influence in the eastern islands, and the US would maintain influence in the eastern islands. The US Navy wanted to utilize Pago Pago Harbor as a coaling site for their ships, which also became key during World War II until the closing of the base in 1951.
ii. Teachers can have students watch the first 10 minutes of the 1978 film Omai Fa'atasi by Takashi Fuji and write down 7�10 explicit details/facts from the video.
9. Using examples from the lecture and videos, students will work in groups to complete the worksheet and provide an analysis of American influence in the Pacific.
10. As a class, each group will share their reflections and answers to: What does this tell us about "American expansion" in the Pacific? How might this impact migration to the US?
Extension Assignment:
Teachers can assign an essay that utilizes the information on the worksheet to write about the impact of American expansion on the Pacific Islanders.

Day Two: Analyzing Racialization of Pacific Islanders through Data
What systems, structures, and events have contributed to the racialization of Pacific Islanders in the US? Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data on the Pacific Islander population?
1. Teacher begins with a group discussion.
a. Teacher asks: What is a Pacific Islander? Who is a Pacific Islander? Is it one group or many groups?
b. In this lesson, we are going to learn that this broad label is composed of many groups, and we are going to analyze what has contributed to this label and what are the outcomes of only relying on this label.
Teacher notes:
� The poverty rate of Pacific Islanders is 20% vs. 12% of the general population.
� Pacific Islanders are half as likely to have a bachelor's degree in comparison with 27% for the total population and 49% of Asian Americans.
� Bachelor degree attainment rate is 69.1% for Asian Indians whereas only 9.4% for Samoans.
� This data shows there is a large difference between the Pacific Islander community and the general and Asian American community.
� It is important to disaggregate the data to identify the needs of the Pacific Islander community.
� This shows there is a need for more services and programs for the Pacific Islander community (i.e., to get into and graduate from college).
� By lumping Pacific Islanders under Asian Americans, Pacific Islander issues become invisible.

2. Students read and analyze the following sources:
a. What Census Calls Us: A Historical Timeline (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EcQI9DyVTfc69YsA6qWe18WWmj8MN75c/view)
b. Excerpt of Community of Contrasts - Executive Summary and Demographics (5� 10) (https://www.advancingjusticela.org/sites/default/files/A_Community_of_Contrasts_NHPI_US_2014.pdf)
c. The State of Higher Education in California (https://www.advancingjusticela.org/sites/default/files/2015-State-of-Higher-Education_AANHPI2.pdf)
d. Lisa Kahaleole Hall - Which Of These Things Are Not Like The Other (pages 729�733, 736�738) (https://pistudies.weebly.com/resources.html)
3. Teacher will pass out the worksheet "The Disaggregation of Pacific Islander Data," which has a number of content questions. Students can work in pairs or in groups to help each other answer the questions.
4. Before students answer the last question from the worksheet and write their paragraph, have a class discussion on what they have learned. Ask the question: How have racial categories impacted Pacific Islanders? Provide one example. Why is it important to disaggregate census, educational, and demographic data on the Pacific Islander population?
Extension Assignment:
The handout and paragraph can develop into a larger assignment that uses data disaggregation to do a report on Pacific Islanders. This report can be an infographic or in essay form. This can also lead in a Youth Participatory Action Research project that provides students an opportunity to do more research on Pacific Islander communities. This could consist of interviews and oral histories. This could potentially add to the growing research on Pacific Islanders.
Day Three: Contemporary Pacific Islander Experiences

What are the contemporary experiences of Pacific Islanders in the United States? How do they use storytelling to share about these experiences and reframe dominant narratives about Pacific Islanders?
1. Students will draw two images, side by side, showing: 1) How they think the world/society views them; and 2) Who they really are. Students will share and explain their drawings.
2. Teacher hands out an excerpt of "Our Sea of Islands" by Epeli Hau'ofa (https://savageminds.org/wp-content/image-upload/our-sea-of-islands-epeli-hauofa.pdf) (pages 6�11), and after student finish they participate in a think, pair, share to answer: 1. How does Hau'ofa discuss the perspectives of the Pacific as islands in a far sea versus Oceania as our sea of islands? 2. Teacher facilitates class discussion to tie in mapping, race, genealogy, and the importance of storytelling.
3. Students will review the following narratives to read/hear examples of Pacific peoples stories on contemporary issues of land displacement, climate change and movements for independence. 1. Standing Above the Clouds (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peDRsxYaF1U)� �short documentary 2. Frontline Truths by the Pacific Climate Warriors (https://350.org/frontline-truths/)� �first person narratives of Climate Justice Warriors 3.

i. Discussion: What stood out to you about these stories? Why is it important to learn about Pacific experiences by listening to/reading the stories of Pacific peoples?
4. Students will create "I Am" poems to share:

1. For each of the items, write 3�5 things that answer each item about you. Use the list to create a poem which repeats the line, "I am from..." followed by your lists. Be creative.
i. Items that were important to you growing up or had significance in your upbringing
ii. Events that changed your life
iii. Names of relatives and/or community members, especially ones that link you to your past
iv. Names of food and dishes that are always at family and/or community gatherings
v. Places important to you
vi. Sayings and beliefs important to you
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
Assessment: The summative assessment has three parts in this lesson. Part 1: An essay on the impact on American expansion on the immigration of Pacific Islanders. Part 2: Data analysis infographic. Part 3: "I Am" poem. These three parts come together to both build the analytical skills of the students and also provide direct opportunities for them to connect to the lesson.
Application: Students will apply the ethnic studies principles to their essay, data analysis, and poems.
Action: Students can do a number of things with what they learned. First, they can use the material to analyze immigration policy that is important today. The teacher can include an extension activity that can compare Pacific Islander immigration with immigration of other Asian American groups. These immigration patterns and trends can be connected back to American expansion and imperialism. Another option is having students choose another racialized group and compare their experiences to Pacific Islanders. The teacher could also have students apply the content and skills of this lesson to develop a more robust Youth Participatory Action Research Project to learn more about Pacific Islanders by conducting interviews or collecting

oral histories with community members. This could contribute to the growing research and literature on Pacific Islanders.
Reflection: Students will use the "I Am From" poems to reflect on how the lesson on Pacific Islanders connects to their own lives.

Lesson Purpose and Overview: The lesson focuses on the history, politics, culture, contributions, challenges, and current status of Vietnamese Americans in the United States.
Overview: Vietnamese Americans play an integral part in shaping the America's multicultural and multilingual transformation. To understand this process, we must examine the following:

� Vietnamese Refugees: Vietnamese refugee experience include escapes by boats to neighboring countries from 1975 to 1995. There were estimates of up to 2 million people escaping by boats, and approximately half of them perished in the high seas. Many faced hunger, thirst, piracy, or other traumatic experiences during their journeys. The international community made great efforts to support these coming waves of refugees, but that exhausted around 1995 when they stopped accepting these refugees and forced them to return to their homeland. The boat people saga and the hypervisibility of the plight of refugees forced the US, and the international community, to negotiate with Vietnam to allow other waves of Vietnamese leaving through other humanitarian programs under the auspices of family reunification that particularly targeted former political prisoners, Amerasian children, and former employees of the US government. Most of the refugees were accepted for resettlement to sanctuary countries all over the world, and many resettled in the US. The resettling refugees were first scattered all over the US, but most of them eventually congregated around the largest concentrations of Vietnamese communities in Orange County, San Jose, Houston, Virginia, or Florida.
� New Life in America. Most of Vietnamese refugees arrived in America without any preparation economically, educationally, or culturally. Children were enrolled in schools at their age level with a new language and education system and limited support. Adults were either enrolled in adult schools or began new lives with new job skills or life experiences which were totally different from their normal lives in Vietnam. Many refugees who settled in the US had no proof of certification of their trades or professional careers. They worked in manually laborious jobs that did not require a mastery of the English language. Many Vietnamese children adapted well in American schooling, but their parents or adult relatives were less successful. Overall, they adapted well in their new homeland, but the scars of the war, life under community rule, boat escapes, and cultural shock upon arrival in America continued with many of them in varying degrees. Those scars foster their anti-communist sentiments and strong pride in and gratitude to America, which welcomed them as refugees, while at the same time nostalgically yearning for the day in which they can return to their homeland.
� Vietnamese American Success and Contributions. The Vietnamese have been resettled throughout the US with varying degree of success, and California is home to many of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of the Vietnam. In California, there are large Vietnamese American communities in Orange County, San Jose, Los Angeles,

San Diego, San Francisco, and Sacramento. Vietnamese students make up one of the highest performing groups academically. Vietnamese Americans make up the second largest world language in public schools, only after Spanish, but before Chinese if Mandarin and Cantonese are considered different dialects. Vietnamese Americans have also made large contributions in high-tech businesses, health care, education, military high-ranking officers, and government officials. Despite the successes, the Vietnamese American community remains the community which has the lowest level of education, low level of median income, or most linguistically isolated, i.e., depending on language assistance.

Key Terms and Concepts: Vietnamese Americans, refugees, oral histories

Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

� enhance understanding and analyze the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans by engaging in a variety of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, books, documentaries, scholarly articles, community programs and resources;

� introduce the distinction between refugees, those who seek political and economic refuge as a result of the various wars taken place on Vietnam soil, and immigrants in America seeking opportunity for a better life; and

� conduct an interview of someone who is a Vietnamese refugee or listen to archived interviews of Vietnamese refugees. Students will develop and ask questions that explore the lived experiences of Vietnamese refugees. Students will record and transcribe the interviews. Students analyze the transcription and create a presentation (using various formats such as PowerPoint, video, paper) on the experiences of Vietnamese refugees.

Essential Questions:

1.

What is the history of Vietnamese Americans in the US?

2.

How has the cultural perception of Vietnamese people and Vietnamese

Americans been shaped and framed by mainstream discourse in the US?

3.

How did the first-generation Vietnamese refugees' experiences differ from

their children who were born in the US. How did their refugee status factor into differing

experiences?

4.

Why is the Vietnamese American experience important to understand within

the context of Asian American studies and US. history? What are the differences

between the refugee and immigrant experience?

Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. The teacher begins the lesson by asking students, "Tell me one thing about you that shapes your experiences and how you see the world." This provides the students with the opportunity to hear the various perspectives.

a. Students engage in writing "I am From..." poem. Students write a three-stanza poem that speaks to their identity, background, experience, and where they are from. Each line of the poem begins with "I am From..." and should follow something specific about their life, upbringing, and identity. Teachers can provide examples. Allow students 10�15 minutes to write their poem. After everyone has finished writing, students can share their poems in class throughout this lesson (5� 6 poems shared per day).

2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Vietnamese Americans and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).

3. The teacher asks students about what they know about Vietnam and its relationship to the United States. "What comes to mind when you think of Vietnam?"

4. The teacher presents some basic information about Vietnamese American history and Vietnamese Americans via article, poem, PowerPoint, or other presentation method. The teacher asks students, "What questions do you have about the refugee experience? What would you like to know more about the refugee experiences of Vietnamese Americans? Please write them down."

5. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Vietnamese Americans in the US. Alternate choral reading��teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts. Quick Fact Sheet attached.
a. Students draft a set of questions that they would like to learn more about the Vietnamese refugees based on the information provided. Prompting questions may include: "What questions do you still have? Whose story is being told? Whose narrative is being left out?" The class compiles a list of shared questions.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Vietnamese refugee experience in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows the movie, Journey from the Fall, inspired by the true stories of Vietnamese refugees who fled their homeland after the fall of Saigon in 1975 and those who were forced to stay behind. As students watch the movie, they should note the hardships and difficulties Vietnamese refugees experienced in their struggle for freedom. Students are also asked to reflect on how the film addresses how refugees are being portrayed in the context of racism and discrimination in the US.
a. Movie: Journey from the Fall (3 hours including bonus materials): http://www.journeyfromthefall.com/Home.aspx. April 30, 1975, marked the of Vietnam's civil war and the beginning of the exodus of hundreds of thousands of refugees. Those remain in Vietnam were imprisoned in communist re-education

camp, others escaped by boat and embarked on the arduous ocean voyage in search for freedom. Thousands of lives were lost at sea. A lucky few found refuge in other countries and were later united with their families.

7. After the movie, students engage in a Think, Write, Pair/Share followed by Group Share exercise, guided by the following questions:

a. How do Vietnamese Americans describe their refugee experience?

b. How were/are Vietnamese refugees being perceived by both Vietnamese Americans and the American public?

c. How was/is the Vietnamese refugee experience being shaped by racial and discrimination policy and practices in the US?

d. How are the Vietnamese refugee experiences similar to and different from other immigrant groups?

Some important things to point out in the discussion:

� The wars in Southeast Asia have been framed by a general understanding in mainstream discourse of the Vietnam War as a proxy war to a global Cold War between two international superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, as a precursor to discussions surrounding communist/anti-communist political ideological difference and divide that would exacerbate the experiences of resettling Vietnamese later.

� Many Vietnamese refugees experience loss, trauma, and suffering as they flee their homeland and seeking political and economic refuge in a foreign land.

�

Being caught between two worlds, Vietnamese American are neither

accepted by the country they left behind nor America given their refugee status,

a reminder of the war that America played a role in it.

� Vietnamese American community development over the past four decades��its resettlement from refugee camps to recognized ethnic enclaves throughout California and the US.

� The racial inequalities and discriminatory practices to Asian Americans and how they negatively impact the Vietnamese community. The COVID-19 pandemic shed light on the racial and socioeconomic disparities that communities of color experience (California governor's remarks about nail salons as the center of the widespread illness has a negative impact on the industry and its workers).
� Recognize the growth, development, and contributions that many Vietnamese Americans are making to the shape the diversity our America.
8. Students read various articles and books through the perspective of Vietnamese American refugees.

i. Excerpt: Prologue and Introduction from Nothing Ever Dies: Vietnam and the Memory of War by Viet Thanh Nguyen

As students read through these articles, students reflect on the following questions:

�

Viet Thanh Nguyen's book Nothing Ever Dies begins with the statement

that "All wars are fought twice: the first time on the battlefield, the second time in

memory." Drawing from the assigned articles, how might this make sense for in

different ways for the first generation of Vietnamese refugees and their second-

generation Vietnamese American children?

�

What is it like to be Vietnamese Americans today?

�

How is the identity of Vietnamese Americans being shaped? What is

visible and what is invisible?

9. Students conduct oral histories by interviewing Vietnamese refugees using the set of questions that the class has compiled in #4 above. Students can also personalize their project by considering how their personal and/or family stories connect to Vietnamese American experience and how the Vietnamese American experience connect to the larger historical narratives and how and why some narratives have been privileged over others. Lastly, students may consider how to improve their own community, what constructive actions can be taken, and whether they provide a model for change for those in other parts of the state, country, and world.

a. See: REFUGENE Project "Record Family Stories" Storytelling Kit for oral history resources in partnership with the Union of North American Vietnamese Student Associations (UNAVSA): https://refugene.com/pages/refugenexunavsa

Some important things to point out in the interviews:
b. How has the refugee experience shaped the identity of Vietnamese Americans?
c. What are the stories that were told and what remain invisible?
i. Why did some remain invisible? What conversation topics/themes were more difficult to talk about?
d. What emotions and/or trauma arise from refugees in sharing their experiences?
e. How do Vietnamese Americans see themselves in relation to other Asian American communities?
f. What are the hopes and dreams for the next generation of Vietnamese Americans?
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework
Chapter 14 of the framework includes the civil rights movement of the 1960s which brought attention to the discrimination faced by various ethnic groups after generations of prejudice, discrimination, and discriminatory policies and practices against communities of color (Hispanic farm workers, Native, and Blacks protested against the heavy hand of racism in housing, employment, and educational opportunities). Following this civil rights movement, California's diversity increased only after President Johnson's immigration act of 1965, opening the door to increasingly large numbers of immigrants from Asia and Central America (page 297). Students may analyze the push-and-pull factors that contributed to shifting immigration patterns, but they should also learn about changes in immigration policy (page 299). Two guiding questions for this chapter include: 1) What did protests and frustrations expressed by Californians in the late Cold War Era reveal about the state?; and 2) In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century?
10.Assessment��To show evidence of what students have learned, students can choose one the following assignments:

Quick Fact Sheet about Vietnamese Americans in the US
� Vietnamese Americans (Ngi M gc Vit) are make up about half of all overseas Vietnamese (Ngi Vit hi ngoi, also known as Vit Kiu) and are the fourthlargest Asian American ethnic groups after Chinese Americans, Filipino Americans, and Indian Americans.
� The Vietnamese community in the United States was minimal until the South Vietnamese refugees arrived in the US following the Vietnam War which ended in 1975. Early refugees were refugee boat people who fled political persecution or sought economic opportunities as a result of US involvement on the war in Vietnam.
� More than half of Vietnamese Americans reside in the two most populous states of California and Texas, primarily their large urban areas. Orange County, California is the home to the largest Vietnamese American population outside of Vietnam.
� As a relatively recent immigrant group, most Vietnamese Americans are either first or second generation Americans. As many as one million people five years of age and older speak Vietnamese at home, making it the fifth-most-spoken language in the US.
� April 30, 1975, marked the fall of Saigon, which ended the Vietnam War, prompted the first large-scale wave of immigration; many with close ties to America or the South Vietnam government feared communist reprisals. Most of the first-wave immigrants were well- educated, financially comfortable, and proficient in English.
� From 1978 to mid-1980s marked the second wave of Vietnamese refugees. Political and economic instability under the new communist government led many to escape Vietnam by small, unsafe, crowded fishing boats. The second wave of refugees were generally lower socioeconomically, as most were peasant farmers or fishermen, small-town merchants, or former military officials. Survivors were picked up by foreign ships and brought to asylum camps in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and the Philippines from which they entered countries that agreed to accept them.

� After suffering war and psychological trauma, Vietnamese immigrants had to adapt to a very different culture. Language was the first barrier Vietnamese refugees with limited English proficiency had to overcome.
� Emotional health was considered an issue common to many Vietnamese refugees, with war-related loss and the stress of adapting to a different culture leading to mentalhealth problems among refugees.
� Vietnamese Americans' income and social classes are diverse. Refugees arriving in the United States often had a lower socioeconomic standing in their home country and more difficulty integrating due to greater linguistic and cultural barriers.
� Vietnamese Americans have arrived in the US primarily as refugees, with little or no money. While not as academically or financially accomplished collectively as East Asian counterparts, census data indicates that Vietnamese Americans are an upwardly-mobile group; their economic status improved substantially between 1989 and 1999.
� Most first-wave Vietnamese immigrants initially worked at low-paying jobs in small services or industries. Finding work was more difficult for second-wave and subsequent immigrants, due to their limited educational background and job skills.
� Young Vietnamese Americans adults are well educated and often provide professional services. Since older Vietnamese Americans have difficulty interacting with the non-Vietnamese professional class, many Vietnamese Americans provide specialized professional services to fellow immigrants.
� Vietnamese Americans are among the most-assimilated immigrant groups in the US. Although their rates of cultural and economic assimilation were comparable to other groups (perhaps due to language differences between English and Vietnamese), their rates of civic assimilation were the highest of the large immigrant groups. As political refugees, Vietnamese Americans viewed their stay in the US as permanent and became involved in the political process at a higher rate than other groups.

Lesson Purpose and Overview (1�2 paragraph narrative explanation):

Students will discuss the reasons for the changing immigration policies of the United States, with emphasis on how the Immigration Act of 1965 and successive acts transformed American society with focus on the unique challenges confronting Lao American immigrants and the different groups among them (i.e., Lao, Hmong, Iu-Mien, Akha, etc.).
Students will learn how the lesser-known immigrants from Laos contributed to greater diversity in American society since the middle of the twentieth century.
Key Terms and Concepts (ties into larger unit key terms but may also include terms specific to the lesson):
The evolving US immigration policies since 1965, their effects on Lao Americans to their contributions to the diversity of the population of the United States of America.
Lesson Objectives: ("Students will be able to..."):
1. discuss the reasons for the nation's changing immigration policy, with emphasis on how the Immigration Act of 1965 and successive acts have transformed American society;
2. understand the unique challenges confronting Lao American immigrants and the different groups among them (i.e., Lao, Hmong, Iu-Mien, Akha, etc.);
3. examine the origins and stages of Lao American immigration and their effects on Lao Americans;
4. learn how the lesser-known immigrants from Laos contributed to greater diversity in American society since the middle of the twentieth century; and
5. Understand how the Vietnam War changed US immigration policy since 1975.
Essential Questions (ties lesson to larger unit purpose):
1. Which period of US policy immigration did your family arrive in the United States? How has that policy supported/unsupported your family?
2. How has the immigration policies of 1975 and 1980 benefited the United States?

3. What current policies exist to support the original intentions of the United States as a country that receives all whom are oppressed?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Instructor opens the class by giving a brief lecture on the following: At the end of the Vietnam War, the Royal Lao Government was overthrown by the Pathet Lao in a communist revolution. Lao politically aligned individuals or families with the USA were allowed entry to the United States with the passage of the Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act in 1975. The Refugee Act of 1980 authorized further Lao refugee migration to the US. Between 1975 and 1992 with over 230,000 (up to 400,000 by some estimates) Lao, Hmong, Khmu, Iu-Mien, Tai-Dam, Tai Lue, Lua, Akha, Lahu and others from Laos immigrated to the US, especially to California, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Texas.
2. The instructor then shows a short film clip on the Lao immigrant experience (`The Betrayal').
3. Classroom
a. Individual students read packet materials in class to prepare for student presentations and discussion comparing and contrasting experiences of Lao immigrants, independently organizing information in note-taking guide while viewing video and reading, identifying and evaluating sources in each media format. (Model writing down points on organizer)
b. Small Group: Students assigned to one memoir/oral history account assemble in individual groups. Students discuss the main ideas and details of the memoir/oral history. They then create a visual display/poster that communicates the immigrant experience (e.g., isolate one quotation for presentation). (Instructor will demonstrate before small group discussion.)
c. Large Group: The class holds a discussion on Immigrant Experience of Lao Americans. Each student shares their response to the discussion. Students compare and contrast the unique and common/general aspects of each memoir/oral history account.

4. Homework: Students write an essay or letter describing their critical analysis and their opinion of how federal/state/local government policy should be changed to better aid new immigrants in their integration to American society. This may include, student's opinion, of the US government role in assisting migrants from Laos stemming from US involvement in the war in Laos.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Ability to accurately present facts from the videos and readings as support for their opinion on the war
 Clearly express their position on the war during debate and small group discussion.

Sample Lesson 21: Korean American Experiences and Interethnic Relations
11th�12th Grade Levels Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7 Standards Alignment: HSS Content Standard 11.11.1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1 Lesson Purpose and Overview: Overview: Koreatown in Los Angeles is a transnational enclave whose formation and development are an integral part of America's multicultural history. The heart of Korean America is in Koreatown Los Angeles. Koreatown was a central hotspot of violence during the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest/Uprising, and Korean Americans were thrust onto the national and international scenes where they were scapegoated, marginalized, and discriminated against. The media inflamed the so called Black-Korean conflict at the time, exposed the deep seeded interethnic issues plaguing inner-city communities. The shooting of Latasha Harlins on March

16, 1991, happened about two weeks after the beating of African American Rodney King. The murder of Harlins by liquor store owner Soon Ja Du stirred the interethnic conflict between Korean Americans and African Americans. The case went to court, and Du received a light sentence and no jail time. The African American community was outraged, and tensions mounted between the two communities. Interethnic relations and conflicts, racism, and police brutality against African Americans fanned the flames of unrest in 1992. When the not-guilty verdicts of the police officers involved in the case of the beating of African American Rodney King came back, inner-city community residents rose up and protested.
Today, the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising resonates strongly with communities of color whose voices are being channeled through the Black Lives Matter movement. Studying the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising provides a framework for students to understand and apply to current events. The manufactured interethnic conflict between Korean Americans and African Americans created by the racially systemic lack of resources, coupled with the socioeconomic issues and police brutality issues, are relevant to this day. The interethnic, socioeconomic, and police brutality issues that African Americans protested about in 1992 are the same issues the BLM movement is fighting against now. Thus, it is important to include such a major event in ethnic studies curriculum because the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising is a perfect case study in the field and is applicable to current events. In the aftermath of the uprising, the Korean American community transformed and became visible by exercising their political, social, and community voices.
The goal of this lesson is to provide an overview of the historic, ethnic, political, and sociocultural background of Koreatown to understand the formation of the Korean American community as we know it today. The goal is also to introduce concepts in interethnic relations/studies through the lens of Korean Americans during the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising and contextualize this with current events. The lesson uses the voices of Korean Americans, articles, textbooks, documentaries, and interviews.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, oral history, Koreatown, 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising, 1965 Immigration Act, Los Angeles, Interethnic Relations.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

 better understand the diverse experiences of Korean Americans by engaging a range of primary and secondary sources including, oral histories, textbooks, documentaries, and scholarly articles;
 introduce concepts in interethnic relations/studies through the lens of the so-called Black-Korean conflict and contextualize this with current events; and
 conduct an interview of someone who was there during the L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising or who is Korean American. Students will develop and ask questions that explore the lived experiences of the subject being interviewed. Students will transcribe the interview and write a short essay on what they learned about the Korean American community through the interview. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure interviews, transcriptions, and essays.
Essential Questions:
1. What is the history of Koreatown and its formation? 2. How did the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest/Uprising effect and transform the Korean
American community? 3. Why is the Korean American experience important to understand within the context of
Asian American studies and US history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone here has experiences or knows someone with experiences that they feel could help others better understand this content, feel free to add to our discussions."
2. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Korean Americans and focus on three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about Korean American history and identity via PowerPoint or other presentation method. The teacher asks students if they have questions about Korean Americans and writes them on the white board. Arirang (documentary on Korean American history by Tom Coffman) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jELVFvva720&feature=youtu.be.
4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the Korean American community in the US. Alternate choral reading��teacher reads one fact, the whole class

reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts. Quick Fact Sheet attached. 5. The teacher and students discuss the quick facts and determine which of the essential questions were answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers together.
The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Korean American experience in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a short history video about the Korean American community. The teacher notes that the students should think about the hardships and difficulties immigrants experienced coming to the US. The teacher also asks students to take note of how the film addresses racism and discrimination. In the Korean American community, the Los Angeles civil unrest/uprising is remembered as Sa-i-gu (April 29 in Korean). For the Korean American community, Sa-i-gu is known as its most important historical event, a "turning point," "watershed event," or "wake-up call." Sa-i-gu profoundly altered the Korean American discourse, igniting debates and dialogue in search of new directions. Many believe that as Los Angeles burned, the Korean American was born��or reborn��on April 29, 1992. The riot served as a catalyst to critically examine what it meant to be Korean American in relation to multicultural politics and race, economics and ideology.
6. "Footsteps of Korean Americans" a short documentary about the experiences of Koreans in the United States gives a concise overview of when, how, why, Koreans came to America. The film also identifies major moments in Korean American history that helped define the United States and also discusses the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising, racism, marginalization, and discrimination. The film also touches on the so-called Black-Korean conflict that was fueled by negative media coverage and the lack of economic resources brought on by systemic racial redlining and understanding. The documentary's narrative shows the development of the Korean American community within the context of race relations in the United States. The film ends on a positive note with an overview of how Korean Americans are facing and dealing with the racial divide in the US and at the same time learning to deal with its newfound identity. The teacher should warn students that some images in the video could be disturbing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtOtB-5yuQ (37 minutes).

7. The teacher shows two to three videos from the Korean American Oral Histories Archive hosted by the YOK Center, UC Riverside. The videos are of Korean Americans who talk about their lives and experiences in the United States. As students watch them, they should think about how these individuals have developed their identity as being Korean American within the context of race and identity. http://kaoralhistoriesyokcenter.weebly.com. Some suggestions of which oral histories to show include: Ralph Ahn; Cindy Ryu; Julie Ha; Philip Yu.
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about this question: How do these Korean Americans describe their experiences and how racism and discrimination effected their lives? Ask students to think for about a minute quietly then have them write for two to three minutes on their own. Afterward, students will be paired and asked to share their thoughts with a partner. Students can be put into breakout sessions for online courses or paired in class at random for in person teaching.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Being caught between two worlds, Korean Americans (immigrants) feel the pressures and the divide in the US along racial lines, especially as they enter small businesses and inner-city communities
� Koreatown's development over the century; its evolution from small unknown community to a recognized ethnic enclave
� The racial inequalities and mistreatment of Korean Americans during the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising and the historic nature of this scenario and how it applies to other Asian American communities
� The racial and socioeconomic disparities that exist in the United States for minority communities including Asian Americans, African Americans, etc.
� Learning how Korean Americans embraced their new host society and became visible after the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising and how Koreatown emerged from the ashes of the violence and became a hotspot for culture, food, and all things Korean in America

� Developing an identity of their own as proud Korean Americans
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Memoir of a Cashier: Korean Americans, Racism, and Riots." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like to be a young Korean American during the tumultuous 1990s and during the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising? (pages 57�62, "Memoir of a Cashier: Korean Americans, Racism, and Riots" by Carol Park.) 1. As students read the excerpt, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text. Annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text. 2. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Carol Park, what was the Black-Korean conflict? 3. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Similar to other minorities, Korean Americans were marginalized and discriminated against throughout US history.
ii. The invisibility and categorization off Asian American and Pacific Islander groups as model minorities needs to be recognized and discussed.
iii. Korean American history is important and should be taught about because of pivotal moments like the 1992 L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14 of the framework includes a section (pages 297�299) on California's involvement in the civil rights movement during the 1960s and discrimination as well as modern immigration, and the state's post-1965 Immigration Act demographics. The chapter asks two essential questions where the Korean American experience and the L.A. Civil Unrest/Uprising could fit in under the Asian American studies curriculum:

� What did protests and frustrations expressed by Californians in the late Cold War Era reveal about the state?
� In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century?
10. Assessment��to show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments: 1. Write 1�3 paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or 2. Discussion group exercise where students collectively write a paper about the Korean American experience and answering the two essential questions. Each student can be paired with one other student or there can be groups of three. Each student in the group writes one paragraph.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
See Step 10 above.

 The Korean American population is about 1.8 million today. The heart of Korean America resides in Los Angeles where Koreatown flourishes amid a diverse demographic. Official Korean immigration to the United States began on January 13, 1903, with the arrival of 102 Koreans in Hawaii.
 In March 1920, Korean Americans establish the Willows Korean Aviation School/Corps in Willows, Northern California. The school is considered the origin of the Korean Air Force today. Many Korean Americans donated to start the school, including Kim Chonglim. He was the first Korean American millionaire.

 On April 29, 1992, the Los Angeles Civil Unrest/Uprising erupt, and Koreatown is burned, looted, and businesses are destroyed. Korean Americans are left to fend for themselves and are marginalized and scapegoated by media. The moment in US history is also considered the birth of the Korean American identity as we know it today.
 On November 4, 1992, Jay Kim is elected to the US House of Representatives and becomes the first Korean American to be elected to the United States Congress.

 On September 14, 1994, Korean American actor Margaret Cho's sitcom All-American Girl premiers on ABC and is the first network sitcom to feature a predominantly Asian American cast.
 Korean American Day is declared by the US government in 2005.  In 2015 David Ryu becomes the first Korean America elected to the Los Angeles City
Council.  During the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, Korean American Chloe Kim becomes the
youngest woman to win an Olympic Gold medal in snowboarding at the games in PyeongChang, South Korea.  During the February 2020 Oscars, Parasite wins awards for Best Picture, Directing, International Feature Film, and Writing, making it the first foreign language film and Korean film to win such honors.

Sample Lesson 22: Col. Young Oak Kim--War Hero, Public Servant, Identity
Theme: History, War, Humanitarianism, Community Service, and People
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4
Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 3, 7; W.9�10.1; SL.9�10.1
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Col. Young Oak Kim was a renowned war hero who served during World War II and the Korean War. Col. Kim helped lead the mostly Japanese American Nisei unit, the 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team. Although he was Korean American, Col. Kim stressed that color lines and racial divides had no place in the United States. Born in Los Angeles, CA, he attended Belmont High School and became a humanitarian after retiring from the US Army in 1972. Col. Kim helped shape the landscape of Los Angeles through his humanitarian work by creating, establishing, and participating in the formation of several nonprofits still in operation today. He helped to create the Koreatown Youth and Community Center, Korean Health Education Information and Research Center, Japanese American National Museum in Los

Angeles, and helped battered women by founding the Center for the Pacific Asian Family. He also helped children through other nonprofits. His work has left lasting change in California, still palpable through the organizations he helped establish and which continue to operate today.
He was the first minority to lead a combat battalion on the field during the Korean War. Col. Kim is an exemplary individual whose life embodies what it means to be living in multiracial America, and the challenges he faced and overcame is part of the history of California that should be recognized. This lesson uses videos, interviews of Col. Kim from the USC archives, books, and articles to illustrate how Korean Americans navigate the multiethnic landscape of California and the United States.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, war heroes, humanitarians, Los Angeles, World War II, Korean War, Asian American, ethnicity, US Army, multicultural, multiethnic.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
 better understand the Korean American experience and multiethnic America through the lens of Col. Young Oak Kim's life as a war hero and humanitarian who helped shaped the landscape of Los Angeles; and
 write an essay, report, or create a video about the life of Col. Young Oak Kim. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure their essay writing skills and learn how to use video presentations, which is an essential skill to have in the online learning platform.
Essential Questions:
1. How did World War II and the Korean War change how Asian Americans are viewed and treated in the United States?
2. Why is it important to study the stories of individuals like Col. Young Oak Kim in ethnic studies?
3. Col. Young Oak Kim's story demonstrates how racism permeated even the US military. Yet, Col. Kim overcame the racial divides. What lessons can we learn from his story when it comes to racism?
Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. The teacher makes a note of telling the class, "If anyone has any experiences that can contribute to the understanding of racial inequalities and ethnic divides, feel free to add to our discussion."
2. The teacher tells students they are going to learn about Col. Young Oak Kim and his Korean American experience. The teacher has students focus on the three essential questions (read essential questions 1�3 aloud).
3. The teacher presents some basic information about Col. Kim and the Korean American community. The teacher asks students if they have questions about the Korean Americans and their role in Los Angeles and other California communities and writes them on the white board.
4. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about Col. Young Oak Kim and the Korean American community in the US. Alternate choral reading��teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts. Quick Fact Sheet attached.
5. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
6. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about racism and immigration in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher plays an audio recording interview of Col. Young Oak Kim. The teacher asks students to think about how racism is not just something that happens on the streets but permeates even the military, as Col. Kim experienced. Also, the teacher asks students to think about how Col. Kim overcame racial divides and became a humanitarian after retiring from the US Army:
"Col. Young Oak Kim" short video on who the hero/humanitarian was created and published by the Council of Korean Americans. The video is a succinct narrative about Col. Kim and his experience in the US Army and how he looked passed ethnic divides and became a war hero and humanitarian. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvmoNQS6GOc (4 minutes and 30 seconds).
7. The teacher shows plays two interviews of Col. Young Oak Kim talking about his early life, his parents' immigration experience to the United States, and later about his personal life and the founding of the Go For Broke Monument in Los Angeles. As students listen, they should think about how Col. Kim developed his Korean American identity and overcame ethnic boundaries and racism. As students watch, they should

consider what it is like to be a Korean American/minority struggling through racial barriers like Col. Kim did. Source: "Col. Young Oak Kim Oral History: Segment 1 and Segment 2." http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/search/field/filena/searchterm/KADAYoungoakkim01;KADA-Youngoakkim01.wave
http://www.goforbroke.org/learn/archives/oral_histories_videos.php?clip=047A12
8. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise. Let students think about the question you have written on the board (How Col. Kim describes his parents' experiences as immigrants in America?) for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Being caught between two worlds, as a Korean born in America, Col. Kim learned to find his identity in the military and in civilian life by understanding he is both identities and bridging the cultural gap meant embracing both identities.
� The frustration Col. Kim felt being told he would be transferred out of the 100th battalion because of ethnic conflict between Japanese Americans and Korean Americans. All Col. Kim wanted to do was fight for freedom and look beyond the racial paradigms.
� Feeling proud to be a Korean American who looked past racial divides and overcame discrimination and succeeded in the military and as a humanitarian.
� How Col. Kim learned to embrace his heritage and culture and earn the respect and trust of his military unit and of the community.
� How Col. Kim realized the importance of humanitarian work and creating a bridge between Korean, Japanese, and Americans through the Go For Broke monument construction in Los Angeles.
9. Have students read an excerpt from "Unsung Hero: The Story of Col. Young Oak Kim." As they read this excerpt, students should think about a similar question: What it is like

to be a young Korean American male? (pages 360�368, Chapter 28, "Candlelight" by Woo Sung Han. Translated by Edward T. Chang).
1. As students read the excerpt, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text. Annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the essential questions and any questions that may have come up during discussion using evidence from the text.
2. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the author, Woo Sung Han, what contributions did Col. Kim make to "not only the Japanese American community, but ultimately to the progress of civil rights of all racial minority communities in the United States?"
3. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Asian Americans were often overlooked and seen as "Model Minorities" and yet Col. Kim was visible, strong, and courageous as a war hero and humanitarian.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding their contributions to society and in war needs to be studied to better understand how ethnic minorities are treated in the United States military and as civilians.
iii. Korean Americans are not discussed enough in Asian American studies, yet individuals such as Col. Kim played a huge and important role in the US military and in the community for Asian American civil rights, social justice, and advancement.
iv. Implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too small of a community to care about by political leaders and as demonstrated by Col. Kim's story, by US military leaders, must be discussed to show how racism and discrimination is systemic.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14, page 310 of the framework includes a section on Ethnic Studies and asks these important questions:

How have race and ethnicity been constructed in the United States, and how have they changed over time? How do race and ethnicity continue to shape the United States and contemporary issues? The story of Col. Kim falls in line with the chapter's definition of Ethnic Studies which is an interdisciplinary field of study that encompasses many subject areas including history, literature, economics, sociology, anthropology, and political science. It emerged to both address content considered missing from traditional curriculum and to encourage critical engagement. As a field, ethnic studies seeks to empower all students to engage socially and politically and to think critically about the world around them. It is important for ethnic studies courses to document the experiences of people of color in order for students to construct counternarratives and develop a more complex understanding of the human experience. The afore mentioned sentence is exactly where the lesson of Col. Young Oak Kim can be applied. Through ethnic studies, students should develop respect for cultural diversity and see the advantages of inclusion.
10. Assessment��To show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments: 1. Write 1�3 paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or 2. Discussion group exercise where students are paired in groups of two or three. Each group writes a paragraph about what they learned and which addresses the essential questions. The group chooses a presenter, and they read their work aloud. Then a larger discussion can be held addressing their thoughts about the topics.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:

Quick Fact Sheet about Col. Young Oak Kim
 Col. Young Oak Kim is an American war hero of Korean ancestry as well as a great humanitarian activist. Thus, his life can be largely categorized as that of a legendary war hero and a dedicated public servant.
 Col. Kim, born in Los Angeles as a second generation Korean American, fought in Europe during World War II as a US Army officer, of the 100th Battalion/442nd RTC, the prominent Japanese American unit. He became a legendary war hero in Italy and in France. Both countries recognized his service with several high military decorations in 2005, including the highest ones in 1945 (Italy) and in 2004 (France).
 Col. Kim also fought in Korea during the Korean War and became a legendary war hero again. Korea recognized his service with its highest military decoration. In Korea, he became the first minority officer to command a battalion on the battlefield in US military history.
 Following his retirement in 1972 as a colonel of the US Army, American political and commercial interests relentlessly pursued him to actively support their causes. Col. Kim avoided these attempts and chose to devote his life to public service.
 Four of the five most important non-profit organizations in the Southern Californian Korean American community were founded and/or developed under Col. Kim's dedicated leadership: Korean Health Education Information Research Center,

Koreatown Youth and Culture Center, Korean American Coalition, and Korean American Museum.  Col. Kim also left his mark within the Japanese-American community by serving as the Chairman of the 100th/442nd/MIS Memorial Foundation, Japanese-American WWII veterans' organization, and Vice Chairman of the Japanese American National Museum.  Col. Kim's life has become a catalyst for a progressive future for Korea�Japan relations.  The Center for Pacific Asian Families is the largest shelter in Southern California for victims of domestic violence. It was also developed under Col. Kim's leadership in the 1990s.  In summary, Col. Kim's public service activities have concentrated on minorities, women, orphans, the elderly, youth, and the underprivileged.  As a war hero and public servant, Col. Kim has received numerous military decorations, civilian medals and awards from the US, Korea, France and Italy.

Sample Lesson 23: Korean American Leader Dosan Ahn Chang Ho-- Community, Struggle, Voice, Identity
Theme: Identity, Community/First Koreatown USA, Voice, Racism
Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4 Standards Alignment:
HSS Content Standard 11.11.1
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.6�8.1, 6�8.2, 6�8.7, 6�8.10
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Overview: Dosan Ahn Chang Ho was a Korean American leader and Korean patriot who founded the first organized-Korean American settlement in the United States in early 1905. He was a political and Korean independence activist who fought for the rights of Koreans in the US and around the world. He raised the Korean American voice and identity in the early 1900s. Dosan also created a Korean Labor Bureau in Riverside, CA to help Korean workers find better jobs and working conditions. Dosan also established several Korean organizations in the US in the hopes his community would gain voice and identity in America. The lesson demonstrates the struggles ethnic minorities like Korean Americans had to go through in the early twentieth century.

Today, there is a Dosan Ahn Chang Ho statue in Riverside, CA commemorating his work. Also, the Korean National Association building in Los Angeles is still standing and serves as a reminder of the early-Korean American community's independence efforts and doubles as a museum. In 2002, the I-10/I-110 interchange was named the "Dosan Ahn Chang Ho Memorial Interchange" and is a marker of the diversity of our nation's roots and future. This lesson uses videos, books, and articles to illustrate how Korean Americans navigated the multiethnic landscape of California and the United States in the early 1900s with Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's help and leadership.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Americans, First Koreatown USA, identity, ethnic voice, multicultural, multiethnic, labor.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� better understand the Korean American experience and multiethnic America through the story and lives of the Koreans who lived at Pachappa Camp (Riverside, CA), the first Koreatown USA established by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho in 1905; and
� write an essay, report, or video about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho's efforts to raise Korean American voice and identity through his organizations, civic activity, and labor management efforts through the Korean Labor Bureau. In doing so, students will gain key skills in how to develop and structure their essay writing skills and learn how to use video presentations, which is an essential skill to have in the online learning platform.
Essential Questions:
1. Why is it important to study the stories of ethnic minorities like Koreans in the United States?
2. What do the struggles for voice and identity by Korean Americans reveal about America's racial history?
Lesson Steps/Activities:

1. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about Korean Americans through the story of Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and his efforts to raise the voice and identity of the small community (read essential questions 1�2 aloud). 2. The teacher presents some basic information about Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and the early Korean American community. The teacher asks students if they have questions about Korean Americans and writes them on the white board.
3. The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about the early-Korean American community and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho. Alternate choral reading��teacher reads one fact, the whole class reads the next fact, teacher walks around the room as students and teacher read the facts. Quick Fact Sheet attached.
4. The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
5. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Korean American experience in the US, focusing on the essential questions. The teacher shows a clip from a video about Korean Americans and the early community during the early twentieth century. Note the students should think about the hardships that these immigrants endured as they looked for labor, shelter, and identity in the United States:
"Footsteps of Korean Americans," a short documentary about the experiences of Koreans in the United States, gives a concise overview of when, how, and why Koreans came to America. The film covers Korean American community development and identity in the early 1900s and discusses Dosan and Pachappa Camp. The documentary's narrative shows the development of the Korean American community within the context of race relations in the United States. The film ends on a positive note with an overview of how Korean Americans are facing and dealing with the racial divide in the US and at the same time learning to deal with its newfound identity. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGtOtB-5yuQ (37 minutes total. Only show the first 9 minutes and 25 seconds on Pachappa and Dosan Ahn Chang Ho).
6. The teacher shows a short video about Pachappa Camp published by the University of California Riverside in June 2019. As students watch the short video describing the camp and the early Korean American community, they should think about how these Korean Americans lived, struggled, and developed their identities and

voices during the early 1900s when anti-Asian sentiment was high. https://youtu.be/YwylsG066I8
7. After the videos, do a Think, Write, Pair/Share, Group Share exercise: Let students think about the question you have written on the board (for example: what were some of the struggles Korean Americans faced in the early 1900s?) Students should think for one minute in silence, then write for two to three minutes, and then share their written thoughts with a partner.
Some important things to point out in the discussion:
� Korean Americans were struggling for voice and identity because their homeland was no longer a country but a colony of Japan during the early 1900s. Thus, Korean Americans faced double racism and oppression from the Japanese and from Americans whose anti-Asian sentiments were high.
� Korean Americans felt a great deal of frustration and sadness at the loss of their homeland to Japan.
� Dosan Ahn Chang Ho and other Korean American leaders worked for the independence of Korea and established organizations and communities like Pachappa Camp to help raise the voice and identity of their people.
� Korean Americans learned to embrace both their host country's culture and keep their heritage and culture while pursuing independence activities.
� Ultimately, Korean Americans developed an identity of their own.
8. Have students read chapter 2, pages 15�30 from Korean Americans: A Concise History. As they read the excerpt, students should think about: What it must have been like for Korean Americans who struggled for the freedom of their homeland while facing racism in the United States? (pages 15�30, Korean Americans: A Concise History by Edward T. Chang and Carol K. Park).
a. As students read the chapter, give them the annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read (adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text. Annotation sheet

attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
b. Hold a reflective class discussion: According to the authors, Chang and Lee, what happened to the Korean American community in the early 1900s and how did they gain their voice and identity? (See pages 23�25).
c. Some important things to point out in the discussion:
i. Racism and discrimination were and are issues to this day. Korean Americans and Asian Americans continue to deal with the issues as do other minorities in the United States.
ii. The invisibility of Asian American and Pacific Islander groups regarding historic oppression and racism is marginalized and should be discussed using lessons like this on Korean Americans and other Asian groups.
iii. Minority communities were pillars of strength and places of congregation and learning. The story of Pachappa Camp, founded by Dosan Ahn Chang Ho, demonstrates how minority stories actually make up the fabric of US history.
iv. Discuss how racism and discrimination against Asian Americans is systemic. For example, discuss implicit bias against Asian Americans as docile, passive, or too small of a community to care about by political leaders or documented by historians.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 12 of the framework includes a section (pages 272�276) on how the US changed postCivil War Era. During the early 1900s the US population began to shift and grow. The chapter asks, "Who came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century? Why did they come? What was their experience like when they arrived?" Students will learn about the Korean American role in the changing demographics and landscape of California and the United States.
9. Assessment��to show evidence of what you have learned the teacher can choose one of two assignments:

a. Write 1�3 paragraphs of 5�10 sentences answering each essential question using the evidence from the sources we used, or
b. Discussion group exercise where students are paired in groups of two or three. Each group writes a paragraph about what they learned, and which addresses the essential questions. The group chooses a presenter and they read their work aloud. Then a larger discussion can be held addressing their thoughts about the topics.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection: See Step 10 above.

Quick Fact Sheet about Korean Americans & Dosan Ahn Chang
Ho in the US
� The Korean American population is about 1.8 million today. The heart of Korean America resides in Los Angeles where Koreatown flourishes amid a diverse demographic. Official Korean immigration to the United States began on January 13, 1903, with the arrival of 102 Koreans in Hawaii.
� In early 1905, Dosan Ahn Chang Ho established the first organized-Korean American settlement in Riverside, CA. Known as Pachappa Camp, the community thrived for years. By 1918, the community along with its Korean Labor Bureau had dwindled in size.

� The Hemet Valley Incident of 1913 resulted in the de facto recognition of Koreans in the US as not Japanese subjects, essentially giving them their Korean American identity and voice.
� In March 1920, Korean Americans established the Willows Korean Aviation School/Corps in Willows, Northern California is established. The school is considered the origin of the Korean Air Force today. Many Korean Americans donated to start the school including Kim Chong-lim. He was the first Korean American millionaire.
� Dosan Ahn Chang Ho died after being tortured by Japanese authorities and released to Seoul National University Hospital in Korea in March 1938. He died a martyr and patriot for Korea.
� On October 3, 1965, the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 opened the door for immigration in the United States. Koreans emigrate to America and the population of Koreans grows from 69,150 in 1970 to 354,953 in 1980 and 798,849 by 1990.
� On April 29, 1992, the Los Angeles Riots erupt, and Koreatown is burned, looted, and businesses are destroyed. Korean Americans are left to fend for themselves and are marginalized and scapegoated by media. The moment in US history is also considered the birth of the Korean American identity as we know it today.
� On September 14, 1994, Korean American actor Margaret Cho's sitcom All- American Girl premiers on ABC and is the first network sitcom to feature a predominantly Asian American cast.
� Korean American Day is declared by the US government in 2005.
� In 2015 David Ryu became the first Korean America elected to the Los Angeles City Council.

Sample Lesson 24: Korean American Unity for Independence (1920�1945)
Theme: Strengths of the Koreans United for the Korean Independence Movement Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4 Standards Alignment: HSS Content Standard 11.11.1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.6�8.1, 6�8.2, 6�8.7, 6�8.10 Facts and Lesson Overview:

Woodrow Wilson's efforts to make peace in Europe during the World War I inspired movements for self-independence around the world. Korean students studying in Japan were among the first to hear about Wilson's Fourteen Points and contacted their fellow Koreans in China, Japan, Hawaii, Korea, and the United States. By the March of 1919, thousands of Korean nationalists organized public demonstrations against the Japanese rule. Protests were held at numerous occasions where the "Korean Declaration of Independence" was read. Over 2 million Koreans participated in over 1,500 public demonstrations in Korea within a few weeks. Prominent Korean nationalists around the world, including Syngman Rhee (who completed his degrees at George Washington University, Harvard, Princeton, and later became the first President of South Korea), Phillip Jaisohn, and Gu Kim, sparked the March 1st Movement and intensified demonstrations. These led the Japanese forces to kill over 7,000 people and arrest at least 40,000. However, even the Korean nationalists who were killed had a profound influence on the Korean Independence. One example was a young Korean woman, Gwan Sun Yu, who was tortured and beaten until she died in September 1920 in prison for marching the streets of Seoul, Korea with her peers shouting, "Mansei/Long Live Korea." Her remarks, "Even if my fingernails are torn out, my nose and ears ripped apart, and my legs and arms are crushed, this physical pain does not compare to the pain of losing my nation. My only remorse is not being able to do more than dedicating my life to my country," would inspire young and old Koreans for generations.
The Korean Independence Movement achieved the independence of Korea from Japan. The date of the surrender of Japan is an annual holiday even the Korean Americans celebrate, "Gwangbokjeol/Restoration of Light Day."
This lesson uses videos, book, and online articles to illustrate how the Korean nationalists, including those who studied in America, united to achieve the Korean Independence from Japan.
Key Terms and Concepts: Korean Nationalism, Inspiration, identity, voice, unity, perseverance, influential
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. identify the influence of Woodrow Wilson and the Korean nationalists that helped to lead to the Korean Independence from Japan;

2. research, discuss and elaborate on the Woodrow Wilson's "Fourteen Points" that presented him with a Noble Peace Prize; and
3. research, write, discuss, and create presentations about the Korean Nationalists (i.e., Syngman Rhee) who raised voice and identity through organizations and civic activities in America while studying as students that assisted with the Korean Independence.
Essential Questions:
1. How did Woodrow Wilson's "Fourteen Points" influence the Korean Independence Movement that changed South Korea's history?
2. Why is it important to learn about the Korean nationalists who studied in the USA?
3. What is patriotism and how did the Korean nationalists influence the people of Korea?
Lesson Steps/Activities/Ideas:
1. The teacher tells students that they are going to learn about how the USA influenced the Korean Independence Movement. Read essential questions 1�2 aloud and have the students volunteer to generate their own questions.
2. The teacher presents some basic information about the occupation of Korea by Japan in the 1900's.
3. Have students read chapter 2, pages 42 to 62, from Korean American History: A Teaching Resource for Educators in California by Edward J.W. Park and John S.W. Park.
As students read the chapter, give them an annotation chart and direct them to annotate as they read. (Adding a symbol next to a sentence that corresponds to their thinking or feeling about the text. Annotation sheet attached.) Tell the students to be ready to answer the question using evidence from the text.
4. Discussion:

After years under the military rule of the Japanese Empire, there was a culmination of forces that led to the March 1st Movement. One of those forces was US President Woodrow Wilson's "Fourteen Points" speech at the Paris Peace Conference. His speech in January of 1918 outlined and promoted the ethos of self-determination for smaller nations around the world. (Carnegie Council)
The teacher asks students if they have questions about it and writes the questions generated by them on the white board.
The teacher leads a read aloud of the Quick Fact Sheet about Woodrow Wilson's "Fourteen Points" and how his principles inspired movements for independence around the world, including in Korea.
The teacher asks which of the essential questions have been answered by the information presented. Go through the questions and answers.
5. The teacher leads a deeper discussion about the Japanese occupation in Korea and the Korean nationalists in America who collaborated for the Korean Independence.
The teacher reads about Syngman Rhee:
Rhee found it impossible to hide his hostility toward Japanese rule, and, after working briefly in a YMCA and as a high-school principal, he emigrated to Hawaii, which was then a US territory. He spent the next 30 years as a spokesman for Korean independence, trying in vain to win international support for his cause. In 1919 he was elected (in absentia) president of the newly established Korean Provisional Government (https://www.britannica.com/topic/Korean-Provisional-Government), in Shanghai (https://www.britannica.com/place/Shanghai). Rhee relocated to Shanghai the following year but returned to Hawaii in 1925. He remained president of the Provisional Government for 20 years, eventually being pushed out of the leadership by younger Korean nationalists centered in China. (Rhee had refused to recognize an earlier impeachment (https://www.britannica.com/topic/impeachment), for misuse of his authority, by the Provisional Government in the 1920s.) Rhee moved to Washington, D.C.(https://www.britannica.com/place/Washington-DC ), and spent the World War II (https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II) years trying to secure Allied promises of Korean independence. (Britannica)

6. KWL Exercise:
Students begin by brainstorming everything they Know about how the USA influenced the Korean Independence Movement. This information is recorded in the K column of a K-W-L chart. Students then generate a list of questions about what they Want to Know about the topic. These questions are listed in the W column of the chart. During or after researching on their own as homework, students answer the questions that are in the W column.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 12 of the framework includes a section (pages 272�276) on how the US changed post-Civil War Era. During the early 1900s the US population began to shift and grow. The chapter asks "Who came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century? Why did they come? What was their experience like when they arrived?" Students will learn about the first Koreans who studied in the US as foreign students.
7. Media:
Show clips from "A Resistance," a Korean movie about Yu Gwan Sun in Sodaemun Cell Number 8, or "Spirit Of Korea" about Yu Gwan Sun and Yun Bong Gi:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_Bvx8pIIIA https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9k4Lo9TzuI
Assignments:
After watching the media, create a short iMovie or skit about what you may do in the USA for an Independent Movement with three of your classmates.
Write a theme song for your presentation. Present to the class.
8. Reflection/Assessments:
Think, Pair, Share:
In this strategy, a problem is posed: Why did the Korean nationalists sacrifice their lives for the Korean Independence? What would you have done as students during that era?

Students have time to think about it individually, and then they work in pairs to solve the problem and share their ideas as an assessment by creating a chart, a PowerPoint, or an iMovie to present to the class.
Project-Based Learning activities:
Students compare and contrast Korean independence movement with American or Mexican Independence Movement discussing similarities and differences in groups to present to the class.

Quick Fact Sheet about the Korean Independence Movement:
� During the colonial period (1910�1945), the Japanese pillaged Joseon's resources, banned the use of the Korean language--even going so far in 1939 as to require Koreans to change their personal names to Japanese style surnames and given names under the Name Order, and conscripted Koreans into their work force or as uniformed soldiers in the Pacific War. � Koreans engaged in persistent struggles to regain their independence. They organized clandestine organizations to fight the Japanese within the country. They also

established forward bases for the independence movement in China, Russia, and the United States and led unprecedentedly peaceful demonstration.
� In March 1919, Korean leaders announced the Declaration of Independence. Students and ordinary people joined them by staging street demonstrations across the country. These protests continued for 12 months, involving about 2 million people, and were violently suppressed by the Japanese, with many thousands killed and wounded. � The movement spread to the Koreans resisting in Manchuria, the Maritime Provinces of Siberia, the United States, Europe, and even to Japan. � Following the March 1919 Independence Movement, organizations representing Koreans were established in Seoul, the Maritime Provinces of Siberia, and Shanghai. � The Provisional Government of Korea established in Shanghai was the country's first democratic republican government; it was equipped with a modern Constitution and a political system that separated the three basic branches (executive, legislative, and judicial) of government. � Leaders of the Provisional Government played a pivotal role in the independence movement between April 1919, when the Provisional Government was established in Shanghai, China, and the country's liberation in August 1945. � Koreans also carried out armed struggles against the Japanese. In the 1920s, more than thirty Korean independence army units engaged in resistance activities in Manchuria and the Maritime Provinces of Siberia. � In June 1920, a Korean independence army unit led by Hong Beom-do dealt a devastating blow to Japanese troops in Fengwutung, Jilin Province, China. In October 1920, Korean volunteers led by Kim Jwa-jin won a great victory against Japanese troops in Helongxian, Manchuria. This is known as the Battle of Cheongsalli among Koreans. � In 1940, the Provisional Government of Korea (PGK) organized the Korean Liberation Army in Chungqing, integrating many scattered volunteer independence fighters in Manchuria. The PGK declared war against Japan and dispatched troops to the front lines in India and Myanmar to fight on the side of the Allied Forces. � Some young Koreans received special training from a special military unit of the United States to better equip them to attack Japanese forces in Korea. � On August 15, 1945, Koreans finally received what they had looked forward to for so long: the country's liberation as a result of Japan's surrender in the Pacific War. US and Soviet troops were deployed to the south and north of the 38th parallel, respectively to disarm Japanese troops remaining on the Korean Peninsula.

� Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points:
In this famous speech before Congress on January 8, 1918, near the end of the First World War, President Wilson laid down 14 points as the only possible program for world peace. Subsequently these points were used as the basis for peace negotiations.

Lesson Purpose and Overview/Thesis
This lesson introduces students to the experiences of early Korean Americans. Koreans began to immigrate to the United States after the Treaty of 1882, but the significant wave began almost 20 years later as farm workers. After they arrived in the US, they faced challenges like other Asian immigrants, such as anti-Asian laws, racism, language barriers, and harsh working conditions. In addition to domestic challenges, they also suffered from the tragedy that happened to their homeland: the colonization of Korea by Japan. As people who lost their country's autonomy and international status as an independent state, they were not able to enjoy the privileges from an official government representative in the US.
Many Korean Americans realized they had the opportunity to help their homeland become independent while living in the US. While navigating all the challenges as immigrants from a colonized land, early Korean Americans actively participated in the Korean independence movement by providing political and financial aid. Eventually, they became the largest donors to the movement out of all of the Koreans communities in the world. During this difficult time, Korean independence activists became the leaders of the Korean American community and they became the official representatives of Korean Americans to the US government instead of the Imperial Japanese government, which stemmed from the Hemet's Korean Incident in 1913.

During this lesson, students will take a close look into the birth of the Korean American community in the early twentieth century. This lesson can be used as a stand-alone lesson or integrated into different units in ethnic studies, tenth grade modern world history, eleventh grade modern US history, or any other modern world/US history classes. I also added the suggested prerequisite knowledge at the beginning of this lesson plan, though it is not mandatory. It is suggested in case you would like to integrate this lesson as a case study into those prerequisite topics. I also suggest using this lesson to compare and contrast immigrants' experiences in the early twentieth century. It could also be used to further investigate the increasingly complex relationship between the US and Japan after the Hemet's Korean Incident until World War II.
The Lesson Steps include only some of the graphic organizers that I provided. However, I recommend teachers use all the graphic organizers for students who are not trained to facilitate full verbal discussions, students who have different abilities (such as English Language Learners), and students who will benefit from additional visual/written organization.

Students will decide who is going to be the "host" for the next group (no one should be appointed to be a host more than once). Each group will move to the next source (example: 7-1 will move to 8-1 and 9-2 will move to 7-2). The "host" will remain at the original group table.
� The "guest" students will have time to analyze the new source at the new table. While other students are analyzing the new source, the "host" will prepare for a summary for his/her/their guests. After analysis, the host will summarize what the previous group discussed and will ask his/her/their guests to share what they learned. The guests and host will try to answer the unsolved questions by using their markers and add remaining questions. Students will decide who is going to be the "host" for the next group, and the previous host will join the original group. Each group will move to the next source. The "host" will remain at the table. Repeat one more time.
� All students will go back to their group. For the students who hosted, other group members will "teach" the former hosts.
� Students will discuss how each source can answer today's question: "How did Korean independence activists in the US help the establishment of the early Korean American identity?"
� Students will write a culminating essay to answer the essential question: "How did Korean independence activists in the US help the establishment of the early Korean American identity?"

*Source Note: US Census data for the mainland from 1910-1950 seems to grossly undercount the Korean population as the census numbers do not reconcile with data from community sources and immigration records, The undercounting may have been due to the transient nature of many Korean immigrants' lives. Because official data are not reliable, many sources provide guesstimates that vary by 500 to 1,000 in any given year.

(...)
In 1882, Congress passed the Chinese Exclusion Act--the only United States Iaw to prevent immigration and naturalization on the basis of race--which restricted Chinese immigration for the next sixty years. The "Chinese Must Go" movement was so strong that Chinese immigration to the United States declined from 39,500 in 1882 to only 10 in 1887.
By 1885, following Chinese Exclusion Act, large numbers of young Japanese laborers, together with smaller numbers of Koreans and Indians, began arriving on the West Coast where they replaced the Chinese as cheap labor in building railroads, farming, and fishing. Growing anti- Japanese legislation and violence soon followed. In 1907, Japanese immigration was restricted by a "Gentleman's Agreement" between the United States and Japan.
Small numbers of Korean immigrants came to Hawaii and then the mainland United States following the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War and Japan's occupation of Korea. Serving as strike-breakers, railroad builders, and agricultural workers, Korean immigrants faced not only racist exclusion in the United States but Japanese colonization at home. Some Korean patriots also settled in the United States as political exiles and organized for Korean independence. (...)

(2011, Pyong Gap Min)
(...) After the diplomatic relations between the United States and Korea were established in 1884, a small number of Koreans, mostly students and politicians, came to the United States at the end of the nineteenth century. But it was approximately 7,200 Koreans who came to Hawaii between January 1903 and July 1905 to work on sugar plantations in Hawaii that composed the first wave of Korean labor migrants. (...) Beginning in 1884, American Presbyterian and Methodist missionaries were active in converting Koreans to Christianity. About 40% of pioneer Korean immigrants were converts to Christianity, and they chose to come to Hawaii for religious freedom as well as for a better economic life (Choy 1979). (...) After its victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan made Korea its protectorate, gaining a free hand in influencing the Korean government. In February 1906, the Japanese government advised that all Koreans abroad be placed under the jurisdiction of Japanese consulates. Koreans in Hawaii and the US mainland organized protest rallies, passing a resolution condemning Japan's aggressive policy in Korea (Choy 1979: 143). In this way, Korean immigrants in the United States started the anti-Japanese movement even before the annexation of Korea by Japan. (...)

Under the Japanese, no freedom. Not even free talking. A very hard time. My auntie told me that my cousin was living where picture brides come, Hawaii. Always I heard Hawaii stories, that time.

Source 5: California Law Prohibits Asian Immigrants from Owning Land [Modified]
(Image | Los Angeles Examiner)
On May 3, 1913, California enacted the Alien Land Law, barring Asian immigrants from owning land [specifically Japanese].
California tightened the law further in 1920 and 1923, barring the leasing of land and land ownership by American-born children of Asian immigrant parents or by corporations controlled by Asian immigrants. These laws were supported by the California press, as well as the Hollywood Association (the picture above is from a home in Hollywood), Japanese and Korean (later Asiatic) Exclusion League and the Anti-Jap Laundry League (both founded by labor unions). Combined, these groups claimed tens of thousands of members.

Though especially active in California, animosity for Asian immigrants operated on the national level too. In May 1912, President Woodrow Wilson wrote to a California backer: "In the matter of Chinese and Japanese coolie immigration I stand for the national policy of exclusion (or restricted immigration)...We cannot make a homogeneous population out of people who do not blend with the Caucasian race...Oriental coolieism will give us another race problem to solve, and surely we have had our lesson."

Los Angeles, Cal., June 26. The Japanese organizations of southern California took immediate cognizance today of the incident at Hemet when 15 Asiatics were driven from the town. H. Wakabayashi, secretary of the Japanese association of Southern California, telegraphed the facts in the case to Y. Numano, acting consul general at San Francisco. As Korea is a Japanese dependency, officials of the Japanese association said Koreans were as much entitled to protection from the mikado's government as Japanese themselves.

Sample Lesson 26: Dr. Sammy Lee (1920�2016)
I've designed and proposed two sets of lesson plans based on the life of Dr. Sammy Lee, one of the most prominent and distinguished Asian Americans of the twentieth century. I hope that the Advisory Committee for the Ethnic Studies Standards in the State of California might endorse these lesson plans, such that teachers in California can incorporate them in the History and Social Studies standards--toward the end of the eighth grade curriculum, when students are studying late nineteenth and early twentieth century United States history, as well as in the last third of the eleventh grade curriculum, when students examine themes in twentieth century United States history.
Professor Grace Cho at Cal State Fullerton and Ms. Eunjee Kang of the San Lorenzo Unified School District helped me to identify and to apply the biographical materials into the History and Social Science Standards for the State of California. My brother, Professor Edward J.W. Park of Loyola Marymount University, helped to prepare this document, and I also received helpful suggestions and corrections from Professor Jennifer Jung-Kim of UCLA and Professor Grace Cho at Cal State Fullerton.

A Biographical Overview of Dr. Sammy Lee
Dr. Sammy Lee had a remarkable life. He was born in Fresno, California, when the state was still heavily segregated by race, but he nevertheless became an officer in the United States Army, and then a distinguished Olympic athlete as an elite diver, first in the Summer games in London in 1948 and again in Helsinki in 1952. He went on to a notable career as a surgeon and physician, as well as an influential diving coach based in Orange County, California. Dr. Lee would serve as an important representative for the United States during the Cold War, and he would also identify and coach other elite Olympic divers over several decades. His life unfolded during the expansion of American military power in the Pacific, and although he experienced white supremacist discrimination throughout his life, he became a new kind of American citizen� �one who represented a more progressive and inclusive multiracial nation.
Even before he was born, American citizens had reshaped the lives of his parents and of his ancestral country. His father, Soon Kee Rhee, had been working as a translator for an American engineering firm engaged in railroad construction. The sovereign monarch of Korea, King Kojong, had granted these "concessions" to foreign companies to strengthen and to develop his country, as other great powers, including Russia, Japan, and China, continued to compete for influence in the Korean court. King Kojong received American missionaries, businessmen, and diplomats to develop ties between Korea and the United States, and this was how Soon Kee Rhee became an indirect beneficiary of these policies to "open" Korea to foreign influence and to strengthen it through modernization.[2]
Rhee used this position to leave Korea, just like many hundreds of thousands of Koreans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Unlike many Korean Christians who went to Hawaii during this period, Mr. Rhee had asked his American employer to sponsor him to study engineering at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Mr. Rhee had married Eun Kee Rhee in Korea before migrating to the United States in 1905, the same year that Korea became a protectorate of the Empire of Japan. Although he had planned to return to Korea, Mr. Rhee feared that his country would soon cease to exist, and he eventually decided to ask his wife to join him in California. Mr. Rhee never completed his engineering degree--instead, he and Ms. Rhee relocated to the California Central Valley, where they would work on a farm over several

years. Their two daughters, Dolly and Mary, were born in 1914 and 1915; Sammy was born in 1920.[3]
The Rhee children were born during a period of intense hostility against persons of Asian ancestry, a period that began in California three decades before the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Immigration exclusions against Asians had expanded over the next four decades��in 1907, for example, under the Gentlemen's Agreement between the United States and the Empire of Japan, both countries agreed to restrict emigration to the other; and under the Immigration Act of 1917, the United States Congress declared all immigration from Asia unlawful. It defined as "Asiatic Barred Zone" to map, visually, all persons excluded under the law. In the state of California, legislators approved of a wide range of discriminatory rules, including the Alien Land Laws, first in 1913 by statute, and then in 1920 through a statewide referendum. These rules barred "aliens ineligible for citizenship" from owning or leasing land-- the provisions in 1920 allowed public officials the right to seize lands from any Asian immigrant found in violation of the rule. And since 1878, under federal precedents, Asian immigrants were "non-white," and thus ineligible to apply for American citizenship.
Moreover, in 1927, the United States Supreme Court said again that Asians were "yellow," and thus "colored" and "non-white," and subject to segregation in public services, including public school systems. California had long been a center for this kind of anti-Asian white supremacy since the mid-nineteenth century, so it's no wonder that Sammy Lee felt this animosity even as a child.[4]
By 1932, the family had relocated to Highland Park in Los Angeles. The Rhee family changed their surnames to Lee, and Mr. Lee ran a grocery store while Mrs. Lee prepared meals to augment the family's income. Her cooking proved popular, and the family experienced some financial stability, but the young man did not transition well to the urban environment: Sammy described his older sisters as "good students," and he described himself as a "spoiled brat." He preferred sports over school, and in school he was prone to fighting and other behavioral issues. He recalled a number of instances when he had attacked and denigrated Japanese kids his own age for "stealing my country." Many years later, Dr. Lee recalled several racial discriminations and slights that were common against people of color in Los Angeles at that time. He had enjoyed swimming and diving with his African American friend, Hart Crum, for example, but the boys could only use the public pool on Wednesdays, as the pool was to be drained and cleaned just afterwards. Sammy learned that some of his white classmates had

parents who did not want "a chink" or an "Oriental" coming into their homes, and at the family store he overheard his father endure racial slurs and other forms of abuse.[5]
As he grew older, he learned of more systemic legal disabilities that his parents had faced. Although he and his sisters were born in the United States, and thus American citizens by birth, he also learned from his father that his own parents could not naturalize into American citizens--being from Asia, they remained "aliens ineligible for citizenship." They could not buy or lease land. Sammy learned that even though they had attended public schools that were not segregated, his parents worried if or how their children could attend college. All of this could feel overwhelming��Dr. Lee recalled how, when he was in junior high school, he had once confessed to his father that he had been ashamed of his Korean ancestry. "I wish that I could be white," he said, if just to be able to avoid the racial slights and discriminations all around them. Even though he became popular and athletic in his teens, he was reminded in multiple ways that white people did not regard him and other people of color, including many of his friends, as "full" American citizens, perhaps not even as fully persons.[6]
Nativism and racism were not just problems in southern California. Issues of race, identity, and citizenship dominated national politics in the first half of the twentieth century. In the 1930s, when the United States was in the midst of the Great Depression, and as several European nations were devolving into authoritarian regimes, either into fascism or into communism, American citizens were debating the broader role of the United States in such a world. Some Americans favored a greater role for the United States in global affairs, as an exemplar of an inclusive, liberal democracy; they felt that racial discrimination and white supremacy were harmful of American leadership toward those ends. Still other Americans preferred "American First," a United States that would be unto itself, one that would pursue its own narrow selfinterests without getting embroiled in global affairs and especially not in yet another world war.[7]
Americans were torn, divided over these issues��since at least 1907, nativists and white supremacists had supported race-based exclusions in the immigration law and in other areas of American life, even as progressive leaders in the federal government and in the states were becoming more vocal and critical of these same rules in the 1930s. Prominent families divided. The First Lady of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt, for example, had spoken openly against racial segregation, quite often more bluntly than her husband, and when she was visiting states like Alabama she disregarded the local custom by sitting next to African Americans. Yet when

Jesse Owens won four Olympic gold medals in the Summer Games in Berlin in 1936, under the resentful eyes of the Nazi Party, President Franklin Roosevelt sent no congratulatory telegram or public acknowledgment to Owens, even though he'd sent many to white athletes on similar occasions. Roosevelt revealed later that he was fearful of losing support from the Southern Democrats, the so-called "Dixiecrats," who also happened to be white supremacists. Throughout the 1930s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation had informed the First Lady more than once that the Ku Klux Klan was calling for her assassination, not so much his.[8]
As a teenager, when Sammy Lee was participating in diving competitions in southern California in the late 1930s, the United States was on the brink of another world war, and it was also a nation divided about its very character and trajectory. Sammy Lee was shaped by these contradictions: having caught the eye of Jim Ryan, a distinguished, semi-retired diving coach, during a regional diving competition in 1938. Ryan trained Lee toward greater strength and precision over the next several years. A gruff and profane Irish American, Ryan coached Lee for free that entire time. Not only did Lee attend racially integrated public schools, Lee was also the first non-white student body president at the Benjamin Franklin High School in Highland Park. And yet he could not attend the prom, as it was held in the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, which did not allow people of color. These old patterns of white supremacy existed alongside new opportunities for people like Lee. Lee went to Occidental College in Los Angeles on a full scholarship, and when was he applying for medical school, he was eligible for a program financed through the United States Army��one that would pay for medical school in exchange for military service afterwards. Such programs were emphatically not available to people of color through the military prior to World War II, but President Roosevelt had changed that policy in the months after the United States had declared war on December 8, 1941.
In 1942, when all of his Japanese American and Japanese immigrant neighbors were being evacuated and incarcerated into internment camps as "enemy aliens," Lee's Korean identity now moved him toward a different fate altogether. He and his family were not interned, his education was not disrupted. Indeed, with Jim Ryan as his coach, Lee won his first National Diving Championship in 1942, becoming the first person of color to achieve that feat. They were disappointed that Lee could not be compete in the Summer Olympic Games in 1940 or in 1944--both had been cancelled because of the war. Lee's father passed away unexpectedly in 1943, but as Lee had promised his father to study medicine, he matriculated at the University of Southern California Medical School later that year. His mother and sisters relocated close to that campus to support him, and he finished his medical degree in 1946.

Because the Army had paid for medical school, he was commissioned as a First Lieutenant within the Medical Corp of the United States Army, and he served as a medical officer through the Summer Games in London in 1948 and in Helsinki in 1952. Senior Army officers supported him whenever Lee had requested time to train for both of these Olympic games--they ensured that he had access to excellent diving facilities for his practices.[9]
All of that support paid off. Sammy Lee was the first American to win multiple Olympic medals in the diving competitions over two different Summer Games��he won the bronze medal in the three-meter springboard and the gold medal in the 10 meter platform, both at the London games in 1948. In the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952, when he was 32 years old, Lee won the gold medal again for the 10 meter platform, becoming the first American diver to defend an Olympic championship in diving. That he accomplished these feats after finishing medical school, in his late 20s and early 30s, and during his service in the United States Army--these circumstances make his achievements all the more remarkable.
As an Olympic champion and as an Asian American, Sammy Lee was in a unique position as a goodwill ambassador for the United States in the postwar period. By 1949, the United States was indisputably a global power--the American military presence was obvious in Western Europe, in Great Britain, France, Italy, and Germany, as well as in the Far East, in Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and in the South China Sea, between communist China and Taiwan. The postwar peace had devolved into a tense Cold War, with the Soviet Union and Communist China becoming fierce critics of the United States and its allies. These communist adversaries had pointed out that white Americans had never cared for "people of color," the people of Africa, Latin America, or Asia, whom they'd enslaved, excluded, degraded, and segregated for many, many decades, ever since the founding of the United States itself. Even as American diplomats insisted that this was not true, or even if it was true that it was no longer reflective of the kind of inclusive country that the United States was aspiring to become, they all realized that racebased segregation at home was becoming a significant liability for leaders of the United States as they sought to exercise global leadership abroad.[10]
Thus, when Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower met with Sammy Lee and asked him, through representatives of the State Department, to serve as a goodwill ambassador for the United States, he agreed to join other prominent people of color, including Jade Snow Wong, Dizzy Gillespie, and Rafer Johnson, to offer themselves as examples of what an inclusive American citizenship could mean. His very presence and accomplishments were to

serve as visible, tangible counterarguments to the "communist propaganda" critical of the United States��Lee was of Korean ancestry, his parents had been "aliens ineligible for citizenship," and yet he had represented the United States in the Olympic Games, he had served honorably in its military, and he was a practicing physician whose medical training had been financed by the American government. In short, his very life suggested that the Americans were not like the Nazis.
In photographs from this period, Dr. Sammy Lee appears with political leaders throughout Europe, South American, and Asia, including President Syngman Rhee, the American ally in South Korea before, during, and after the Korean War. In South Korea, thousands of Koreans regarded Sammy Lee as a national treasure, even though, by his own admission, he could not quite understand the accolades and words of praise coming from so many Koreans in Korean. He served in the United States Army Medical Corp in South Korea from 1953 to 1955. In interviews from this period, his mother had explained how Dr. Lee's father had come to America to pursue the American Dream, and then how Dr. Lee himself came to fulfill that dream. All three of her children were college graduates, she said, all three were living fulfilling lives, and yet Sammy's life was well beyond any mother's expectations.
In her essay about Sammy Lee during this period, Professor Mary Lui of Yale explained how Dr. Lee presented as a visually stunning person--as a champion diver, he often wore swim trunks in exhibitions and in other public occasions. Dr. Lee had, by all accounts, an excellent physique well into his forties. That American diplomats and public officials were presenting him for over a decade as an American citizen was itself a striking example of how the "American body politic" was altering, to be inclusive of Asian Americans, which, at the very least implied that the United States was no longer committed to white supremacist notions of white racial purity or white race-based citizenship. Throughout the history of the United States, the "American citizen" had been a white person, and so Lee's body became yet another symbol of how that wasn't necessarily going to be part of the American future. As American diplomats featured these people of color as American citizens, they implied that other people of color in Africa, Asia, and Latin America could trust the Americans to be fair and impartial, should they also fold themselves into the American sphere.
And it wasn't all just for public display. Progressives in Congress and activists across the country saw this moment as an occasion to change American public law. In 1952, for example, Congress amended federal citizenship laws to allow Asian immigrants to apply for naturalized

citizenship, a change that would allow people like Dr. Lee's mother to apply for American citizenship for the first time in American history. Broader immigration reforms, however, would prove less politically popular. Over President Truman's veto, Congress chose to retain the National Origins system that continued to restrict immigration from Asia, and Congress would not repeal those restrictive policies until Lyndon Johnson's presidency in 1965. White supremacists still held considerable political power. In 1954, when the United States Supreme Court announced its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, United States Senators would take to wearing simple buttons that said "NEVER" on the floor of the Senate, as in they would never comply with Brown.[11]
Indeed, even after the Olympic medals, Dr. Lee and his family continued to encounter white supremacist resistance in unsettling ways. In 1955, when Dr. Lee and his wife Rosalind were looking for homes in Orange County, they were turned away twice, in Garden Grove and in Anaheim, because even the newer subdivisions were still segregating by race. Despite the ruling in Shelley v. Kraemer, yet another influential United States Supreme Court precedent against such race-based segregation in 1948, real estate agents told Dr. and Mrs. Lee that they could not help "non-whites." The couple drew attention to this problem, local politicians for the County agreed to form a Council for Equal Opportunity, and even Richard Nixon said that he'd been "shocked" by how the Lees had been treated. They eventually did buy a house in Garden Grove, albeit not in that neighborhood, and Dr. Lee ran a successful medical practice in Orange County as an ear, nose, and throat specialist until his retirement in 1990.[12]
Throughout that period, Dr. Lee continued to represent the United States at the request of successive American Presidents, including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. And he coached��he worked with several Olympic divers, including Pat McCormick, Bob Webster, and Greg Louganis. During a time when some had encouraged female divers not to perform complex, acrobatic dives, Lee trained McCormick as she became the first American woman to win four gold medals over two consecutive Summer Games, in Helsinki in 1952 and in Melbourne in 1956. Dr. Lee trained Bob Webster using a sand pit that he'd built in his own backyard, a technique inspired by Jim Ryan's own unconventional methods. Webster won gold medals in diving in Rome in 1960 and then again in Tokyo in 1964, becoming the first American diver after Sammy Lee to win gold medals in two consecutive Summer Games.
After the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo, Dr. Lee had invited several members of the Japanese national team to his home in Orange County to practice and to coach all of them. He suggested

that he did this "to atone" for his own "poor behavior" toward those Japanese kids of his youth. In the early 1970s, Sammy Lee coached Greg Louganis, and the young man eventually moved into the Lee family home to use the pool and that sand pit. Louganis would become one of the most decorated American Olympians ever--Louganis won five Olympic medals, including four gold medals, over three consecutive Summer Games, in Montreal in 1976, in Los Angeles in 1984 and in Seoul in 1988.
Toward the end of his life, after he stopped practicing medicine in 1990, Dr. Sammy Lee suffered from dementia and heart disease, and he retired from public life in his mid-seventies. He was by then among the most distinguished and decorated athletes of the twentieth century: Sammy Lee won the James E. Sullivan Award in 1953, given to the most distinguished amateur athlete in the United States, and he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1968 and into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame in 1990. The City of Los Angeles dedicated a corner of Koreatown--on Olympic and Normandie--the Sammy Lee Square in 2010, and the Los Angeles Unified School District named an elementary school after him in 2013. He passed away at his home in Newport Beach in December 2016, when he was 96 years old.
Lesson Plans
Because his life traversed that period of American history characterized by race-based segregation against people of color--including persons of Korean ancestry like Dr. Lee--and because of his remarkable record of accomplishments, we ought to integrate his biography into twentieth century United States history. New lesson plans based on his life would be most appropriate, I think, for students in eighth grade and in eleventh grade, according to the History� Social Science Framework as it was approved in California in 2016.
For Eighth Grade Students
Toward the end of the eighth grade curriculum in California, students study American history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when California itself becomes an important part of the national economy and when the United States projects its power across the Pacific even as Congress approves new and influential restrictions against Asian immigrants. A core part of the eighth grade curriculum focuses on issues of citizenship and belonging--even after the abolition of slavery, white Americans still supported race-based segregation throughout the states, and public officials in all three branches of the federal government supported similar

discriminatory rules and policies. New immigration rules--including the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the Immigration Act of 1917--identified Asians as "unassimilable," as "aliens ineligible for citizenship," and Congress drew a line over Asia itself, as a "Barred Zone" from which no one should come to the United States. Over this same period, discriminatory rules against Asian immigrants were common and politically popular among large majorities of the white electorate, during a period when people of color themselves couldn't vote.
Under the History and Social Science standard, 8.12.7, students should: "identify new sources of large-scale immigration and the contributions of immigrants to the building of cities and the economy; explain the ways in which new social and economic patterns encouraged assimilation of newcomers into the mainstream amidst growing cultural diversity; and discuss the new wave of nativism."
Based on the templates that Ms. Eunjee Kang has shared with us, I would propose the following:
The Lesson Title should be "Dr. Sammy Lee." This Lesson aligns with HSS 8.12.7. The Disciplinary Area is primarily in Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies. The Essential Question should be: "How did people of color, including immigrants from Asia, cope with white supremacist rules in the early twentieth century?" The length of this lesson would be approximately one hour.
The Content Learning Objective should focus on the Biographical Overview presented in this document. Teachers should focus on the public law in the United States, both at the federal level, with special focus on immigration rules, and then on state rules like the Alien Land Laws in California. Students should learn how, since 1852, Asian immigrants were considered "nonwhite" and "aliens ineligible for citizenship," and that they were thus subjected to a wide range of race-based rules consigning them to segregated schools, restricting them from public employment, and making land ownership unlawful. These practices persisted well into the first half of the 20th century, and significant majorities of white Americans continued to vote in favor of these rules over many decades. In terms of the biographical elements for this lesson, teachers should focus on Dr. Lee's parents, their migration to the United States, and then the family's life in Los Angeles through 1940.

The Historical Thinking Learning Objective should focus on these rules from the perspective of people of color. The Essential Questions for this lesson should be as follows: what did it feel like to live in such a white supremacist political environment if you were a family of color?
What specific rules circumscribed his family, and how did these lead to prejudiced behavior against Sammy Lee? (In this portion of the lesson, teachers may wish to ask their students, especially the students of color, whether they still feel as though they are second-class citizens, and whether that might be a legacy of white supremacist public rules and attitudes.) Sammy Lee's early biography is replete with race-based discriminations and insults, both against him and his family. His parents suffered significant legal disabilities as well: they could not apply for American citizenship, nor could they own property in California. Mr. Rhee had come to the United States because the Americans had come to his country first--the Americans were becoming a Pacific power, they already held the Philippines and Hawaii as territories, and yet when Mr. Rhee arrived in the United States, he learned rather quickly that he and even his native-born American children would not be regarded as a "full" American citizens.
As a child and as a teen, Sammy experienced forms of discrimination that caused him to hate himself and his heritage, which was, unfortunately, a rather common response among children of color throughout American history. Students should also learn a very important lesson--that some white Americans did not embrace white supremacist attitudes and that a significant fraction of white folks were rather moving away from them. Sammy's teachers, his coaches, and his friends treated him with respect and dignity, and through high school, college, medical school, and military service, Sammy Lee experienced new opportunities that were possible for people of color after 1930. Race-based segregation and white supremacy were weakening in critical ways during the course of his life, and Sammy Lee was thus "assimilating" into American citizenship through pathways that were not possible for persons of Asian ancestry in the late 19th century.
Through a study of Sammy Lee's early life, students will learn how the American presence in Asia could stimulate migration from Asia to the United States, and then how Asian immigrants faced tremendous legal and social barriers to their integration after they arrived here. Those barriers then weakened over time, such that by the late 1940s, white military leaders, white coaches, white teachers, white professors, white classmates, and his entire family were all supporting the aspirations of an Asian American diver and Olympian. All of these lessons address the standards for students in eighth grade, as they appear in 8.12.7.

I would be open to creating an hour-long presentation based on the materials collected for this project, one that would integrate photographs and other visual materials about Sammy Lee. In studying his early life, even before the Olympic Games in 1948, students would appreciate, I think, the story of a young man who'd faced considerable adversity, but who excelled in no small part because so many people had supported him, many of whom were, in fact, white. He benefitted from the progressive turn in American politics in the middle of the twentieth century. In addition, his early life also offers sobering lessons about the vagaries of race and identity: had he been of Japanese ancestry, he and his family would have been interned in 1942. It's hard to imagine how he would have become an Olympic medalist if he'd been forced to endure that hardship. Lee's life thus illustrates an important lesson from the late historian Ronald Takaki--World War II represented a catastrophe for Japanese Americans, but it also represented a tremendous opening of opportunities for other Asian Americans.
For Eleventh Grade Students
In the last third of the eleventh grade History and Social Science Standards, "students should analyze United States foreign policy since World War II" (HSS 11.9), and students should also "analyze the development of federal civil rights and voting rights." (HSS 11.10).
Although these topics are (still) taught separately in high school, professors in college teach these two together--that is, American foreign policy in the postwar period was intimately related to American race relations and to the broader Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Race-based discrimination was embarrassing to the United States. The communists in the Soviet Union and in China pointed out that American law looked a lot like Nazi law, that American law had inspired Nazi law, including the Nuremburg Laws, and that no person of color anywhere in the world should trust Americans when they were presenting themselves as examples for the rest of the world. The communist critique was simply true: American law was openly white supremacist, it had been that way for decades, and when American diplomats were attempting to exercise American leadership, they knew that this criticism was both very true and quite devastating for American foreign policy. Successive Secretaries of State, including George Marshall, Dean Acheson, and John Foster Dulles, warned Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, and Kennedy that civil rights reforms domestically would be essential for American diplomacy abroad.

In that context, it's difficult, even now, to assess the global impact of people like Jesse Owens, Jackie Robinson, Joe Louis, or Sammy Lee. White supremacist had long held that people of color were not only intellectually inferior but physically inferior as well--people of color were like animals, they said, and under the elaborate rules of competitive, "civilized" sports, people of color were unfit to compete. And even if they did, they were unsuited to win. So, when Jesse Owens dominated the track and field events in the 1936 Summer Olympics, white supremacists struggled to explain how they had been so wrong. Sammy Lee did not have the taller, "conventional" body of an Olympic diver--his coach, Jim Ryan, told him as much--and yet when he performed acrobat, stunning, and precise dives from the springboard and from the platform, his very performances also undermined one of the singular tenets of white supremacist thinking. White people were not, in fact, physically superior, nor did they have a monopoly on physical or athletic perfection. For many younger students now, so accustomed to seeing people of color in sports, these physical and aesthetic dimensions of white supremacy might seem especially ridiculous, and yet in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, many white supremacists pointed to these purportedly "innate" differences between "races" to justify race-based exclusions and discriminations, and to insist on the inferiority of people of color.
The Lesson Title should remain "Dr. Sammy Lee." This Lesson aligns with HSS 11.9 and 11.10. The Disciplinary Area is primarily in Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies. The Essential Question should be: "How did people of color, including distinguished athletes like Dr. Sammy Lee, help to reshape opinions about the United States, and how did their diplomacy help to persuade people of color throughout the world that the United States was no longer committed to white supremacist by the middle of the twentieth century?" The length of this lesson would be approximately one hour.
For eleventh grade students, the Content Learning Objective for this lesson should involve the emerging Cold War after World War II, the unique problems facing American diplomats, and the struggles of a new, rising middle class in the United States, one consisting of people of color in no mood to tolerate race-based segregation any longer. Those activist people of color found in American diplomats their strangest and most unlikely allies: all of a sudden, top diplomats in the State Department were looking for prominent people of color to tour the world, to say to other people of color that the Americans were not, or at least no longer, total racists. By bringing Olympic athletes like Dr. Sammy Lee to Southeast Asia, Europe, and South Korea, the American diplomats were trying to improve the image of the United States throughout the world.

Dr. Lee was a willing participant in these efforts--he'd spent many months meeting with dignitaries everywhere, and he gave diving performances in every conceivable venue. Professor Lui is right: there was something physically striking about the man, this Asian American diver, his movements and flight into the water were so precise and spectacular that everyone could see and acknowledge his skill and perfection. In Korea, he was a national hero, not just because of the Olympics, but because he was also a doctor.
In late high school, and in the first years of college, we often ask students to take an empathetic point of view toward historical subjects. Thus, the Essential Questions and the Historical Thinking Exercises for eleventh grade students might include the following: How would you behave, if you were to take the position and perspective of the historical actors that we're studying, including the people of color who were being asked to defend the United States during the Cold War? That is, we should ask students how they might behave in Lee's position. He grew up facing all kinds of white supremacist slights and insults, his parents faced all manner of abuse and discrimination; and yet, after winning the Olympics, would you travel the world and state how wonderful the Americans were? I think that like so many other prominent people of color, Dr. Sammy Lee was torn between an honesty about the United States as well as its promise, embodied in his own life. Many white folks in his life had been rude, insulting, and racist, and still many others had been giving, supportive, and generous.
For white students, this portion of the lesson might involve considering what kind of white person they might have been in California before 1950. For students of color, Sammy Lee's own admission that he "wished to be white" could become an important occasion to consider their own internalized racism, to reflect upon how racism can "teach" children of color to hate themselves. For all students, Lee's life overall can serve as a reminder that a multiracial American citizenship remains a rather recent development, a mere fraction within the longer arc of American history.
Students in late high school would appreciate the contradictions of the United States, and many would find Lee's insights helpful and relevant. In one interview, he reportedly said: "Whenever I was asked by those people in the Far East how America treated Oriental people, I told them the truth. I said Americans had their shortcomings, but they had the guts enough to advertise them, whereas others tried to cover them up." That he persisted as a physician and as a coach to other Olympians, including a woman, Pat McCormick, and a gay man, Greg Louganis, demonstrates the depth to which his life had captured the fundamental shifts in the meaning of

American citizenship throughout the twentieth century. We still live in a time when Americans still divide over these issues, which might be all the more reason why this particular life is worth studying.
References for Dr. Lee
There are already at least two decent children's book--with illustrations--for younger students based on Dr. Lee's life. The larger picture book, by Paula Yoo, is appropriate for children in grades two to four; Ms. Yoo has published a version for older children in grades six to eight. Erika Fernbach interviewed Dr. Lee and in 2012, she produced a book told from his first-person perspective--this book is also most appropriate for children, perhaps in the fourth and fifth grades. Professor Mary Lui of Yale University published a scholarly article about Dr. Lee in the years after he'd won his Olympic medals, when the State Department had asked him to be a "goodwill" ambassador. But Professor Lui's essay seems to be the only scholarly work about Dr. Lee, which is unfortunate, in light of how Dr. Lee's life touches upon so many important central themes in American history throughout the twentieth century.

CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): 12.8 CCSS for ELA/Literacy (9�12): RL 9.4, 10.6, 11.2, 12.10
SL 9.1, 10.2, 11.1, 12.4 CA Reading Standards Literacy in History/Social Studies (6�12): RH 9.2, 10.7, 11.6, 12.9 California Arts Standards--Music: Anchor Standard 6: Acc.MU:E.Pr6 Media Arts: Anchor Standard 1: Prof.MA:Cr1 Dance: Anchor Standard 1: Prof.DA.Cr.1 Lesson Purpose and Overview Students creating their own K-Pop video will provide an opportunity to understand the impact of K-Pop as well as expose students to Korean pop culture and its global influence. It will stimulate students' interest in Korean culture through a medium that is part of their daily lives. Lesson Objectives Students will collaborate to recreate K-Pop videos of their choice, analyze the lyrics, styling, fashions, dance, music and the cinematography used in making K-Pop music videos to gain an understanding of modern Korean popular culture and the entertainment world thereof. Essential Questions

1. What is it about K-Pop that has exploded in popularity across the globe? Let's seek to gain some insight to why there are such huge international fanbase all over the world. We will attempt to do this by walking in their footsteps (or dance steps!)
2. What is or was your first impression of K-Pop? What are some similarities and differences of K-Pop in comparison to American popular music?
Lesson Steps/Activities
1. The teacher will take a poll of the students to get a quick visual assessment of how much prior knowledge students have of K-Pop. Ask "Show me by holding up your fingers from one to five, one being you know close to nothing, to five being you are a diehard fan and have attended concerts or know when the next new hottest KPop group's song will drop on YouTube." Take mental note, then show some samples of current popular songs. (Refer to Materials and Resources below for online references and links for how to find these sources)
2. Students will be placed into groups of 4�5 and make a selection of a K-Pop music video of their choice to recreate and get it approved by the teacher for appropriate content and lyrics. They will work off of two video sources: one, the official video and another one that provides the Korean lyrics, English romanization and translation all simultaneously line-by-line while highlighting the photo of the KPop idol who is singing the specific parts. (Refer to Materials and Resources for these links.) They will then decide who will be filmed for which portions of the song and prepare their parts to do any combination of lip sync, dance, or act out the content of the song in an artistic and creative way.
3. Students will observe and take note of the wardrobe, hairstyle, makeup, dance moves, video angles, and scenery and background choices used in the original official music video and use the information to guide their remake. They will be given the freedom to make it as close to the original as they can, or they may interpret using their own twist��simplify dance moves and decrease the number of video frames and changes of scenery as needed to make it less overwhelming. It can even be done as a parody as long as it is done in good taste and not in a disrespectful

manner. Pay attention to see that your version and interpretation of the video is in line with communicating the meaning of the song and keeps within the overall theme.
4. Students will be given 3�4 weeks' timeline for planning and rehearsals to either meet with their groups outside of class time and/or be given group time during class. They will schedule video shooting days and prepare and bring any props and costumes to make recording on campus possible or meet at a student's house with parental support.
Assessment, Application and Reflection
1. Having analyzed the original music video and producing your own, what is the message of the song and what are the values, interest or concerns expressed? Is it something that you can relate to? Give examples and explain.
2. Having looked closely at the dress/costuming of the members, were you able to find similar clothing items from your closet to emulate the style of the member you took on? What seems to be the influence of their fashion?
3. Has your interest been piqued? Who's your "Bias"? (This question in K-Pop means they are asking you who your favorite member of an idol group is.)
Want to know more about the member(s) of the K-Pop group you made a cover music video of? Students can search a variety of websites that provide additional information.
Material and Resources
1. For most popular and recent K-Pop videos, simply search YouTube by keywords such as "KPOP 2020" or "Most Popular KPOP". Review them prior to showing students for content, appropriate lyrics and visuals.
2. Example of the two music videos the students will need to work off side by side for K-Pop with Korean lyrics:
Original official video:
BTS, (Boy With Luv) (feat. Halsey)' Official MV

YouTube, https://youtu.be/XsX3ATc3FbA Boy With Luv - BTS ft. Halsey (Han/Rom/Eng) https://youtu.be/oio-gilD57c These kinds of YouTube channels have a wealth of popular K-Pop playlist libraries which makes it possible for non-Korean speakers to understand the song and even sing along with the romanization of the lyrics.
Sample Lesson 28: Important Asian American Historical Figures
Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies Grades 9�12 Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 2, 6 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1�4 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 6 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a Lesson Purpose and Overview: As part of a larger unit on understanding the contributions and role that Asian Americans have played in the building of the United States, this lesson on historical figures guides students to explore individuals within a historically oppressed community. Furthermore, students will understand how these historical figures contributed to a broader social movement that challenged racism, sexism or classism. Students will analyze the impact of that broader movement on the community and institutional structures, through research and analysis utilizing critical questions to guide their research and then presenting a biographical pictorial timelinesignificant PowerPoint to the class.

Key Terms and Concepts: social movement, institutional racism
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. conduct research utilizing the critical essential questions; 2. create a pictorial presentation, with captions, timeline, poem, and quotes; and 3. strengthen their research, analytical reading and notetaking, presentation creation and
public speaking skills through presenting their research findings.
Essential Questions:
1. Describe the upbringing, class background, life experiences and decisions made by the historical figure.
2. What made this historical figure and important person in the movements for racial equality? How did they challenge systems of white supremacy?
3. How did their leadership and achievements contribution to the movement for racial and economic equality?
4. What can we learn from this historical figure about how we should challenge white supremacy today?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Teachers can let students choose a historical figure from the list provided, The teacher may assign students a historical figure. Depending on the students' interest. Teachers can challenge students by choosing a historical figure that is not from their ethnic background to expand their knowledge of other groups.
2. Research��Once all students have a historical figure, walk through the steps of doing the research using the Source/Notes page. Make sure students are versed in evaluating valid sources on the internet making sure the sources are not biased, misleading, or nonfactual. Students should choose 2�3 valid sources on their historical figure with each source covering a variety of information. Demonstrate how to read for factual information and write notes in the Source/Notes page. Ensure the source information is complete. Students should use the four essential questions to guide their research.
3. After the research is completed, students should prepare a visual biography PowerPoint presentation which will include:

a. Title: Create a title using the name of your person with a picture. Also put your name, instructor's name, subject, and period.
b. Address all four essential questions in your presentation using photos, drawings, captions, and bullet points.
c. Poem: Write a biography poem about your person.
d. Quotes: Collect 1�3 or more quotes from or about your person.
e. Illustrations: Use pictures or drawings highlighting your person's life and accomplishments.
f. Captions: Type appropriate captions to explain your illustrations.
g. Annotated Timeline: Show important events and dates relevant to your historical figure.
4. Resume: Students will create a resume for their historical figure. 5. The PowerPoint will be followed up with the students writing a "Biographical Research
Essay" using Modern Language Association documentation format. 6. Other considerations: Some of these figures are on the list because they have made key
cultural contributions.
Has your figure made a significant cultural contribution?
Culminating Activity
1. The final activity for students will be to become their historical figure. This step will be accomplished by writing a speech in the voice of the individual they have been researching and by presenting that speech in costume to a group of their peers.
2. For the overall project, students should be expected to conduct a 30-minute oral history interview with their interviewees and transcribe at least one interview. This is given as a homework assignment and should be completed over two weeks. Students are also encouraged to ask their interviewees for copies of old pictures, images of relics

that hold some significant meaning or value to them, and/or other primary sources that speak to their migration story.
3. Students are allotted three days to work on their presentations in class and as a homework assignment. Students are given an opportunity to practice their presentations with peer-to-peer and peer-to-small-group sessions before their presentation to the whole class.
4. Before students begin their presentations, teachers should review or establish norms about presenting and audience expectations. During the presentations, students in the audience should be active listeners��taking notes and asking follow-up questions at the end of each presentation. Presenters should use this time to demonstrate their public speaking skills--maintaining eye contact, using "the speaker's triangle," and avoiding reading slides or poster boards.
5. After completing the assignment, teachers and students can share the projects with the broader student body, their families, and communities by posting them on a class/school website, displaying poster boards around the class, or by coordinating a community presentation event.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Peer assessments are used to help students refine their PowerPoint presentations prior to presenting them to the class. The teacher should visit the practice groups and provide constructive feedback to students who are having difficulty with the assignment.
 During the student presentations, the teacher can evaluate the students' presentation skills in the context of the grade-level expectations in the CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy, especially the standards for Speaking and Listening.
 Teachers can use the students' graphic organizers to determine how effectively they have absorbed the key concepts and connections from the student presenters.

Lesson Purpose and Overview (1�2 paragraph narrative explanation)
The unjust and unconstitutional incarceration of Japanese American during World War II is a significant moment in American history with a profound effect on the lives of individuals, a community, and our nation. In the short term, it uprooted Japanese American families and individuals, including immigrants and American citizens, from their homes on the West Coast to be incarcerated in American concentration camps throughout the nation. During this

incarceration, Japanese Americans suffered family separation, the loss of homes and businesses, harsh day-to-day living conditions, and the denial of basic civil rights guaranteed in the United States Constitution. After the war the camps were closed, but Japanese Americans continued to grapple with the legacy of that experience and how it impacted their lives as individuals, as families, and as a community. Even though the nation itself eventually apologized for what it had done, marking a turning point for the Japanese Americans, the horrors of incarnation remain and generations of Japanese Americans and the United States still grapple with its legacy.
This lesson begins with an overview of the history of the incarceration and the findings of a 1983 Congressional report that led to an apology issued to the Japanese American community by the United States government. The report concluded the incarceration was an injustice fueled by "race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership." However, it was not until 2019 when the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans was found to be unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court. Students will then employ the historical analysis skills of working with evidence and historical empathy to investigate how the incarcerees used poetry and other art forms to illuminate the incarceration's profound impact on their individual and family lives. Students will also investigate contemporary poetry and spoken word pieces that retell the stories of what happened to Japanese Americans during World War II for a new generation, and the import of those stories for us today as we grapple with government policies and rhetoric that echo that dark time in American history.

Lesson Objectives
 Use a variety of sources, text, poetry, videos to analyze the basic history of the Japanese American incarceration.
 Analyze and read poetry as a literary form and as a historical source document.  Analyze how the historical context of their World War II incarceration shaped and
continues to shape the perspectives of Japanese Americans.
Essential Questions
1. What does the poetry and art produced by Japanese Americans during their World War II incarceration reveal about the impact of this experience on their lives as individuals and family members? What is the legacy of these experiences?
2. What were the causes that led up to the mass incarceration of all people of Japanese ancestry during World War II? What was the impact of incarceration in individuals, communities and the nation?
3. What can we learn from poetry written during the incarceration and written today about the impact of incarceration on individuals, communities, and the nation?
4. What evidence do you see that supports the argument of incarceration was a significant moment in history and peoples' lives?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
DAY 1 Materials: Slides, note taking paper, pens, Overview handout, timeline, incarceration sites map
1. Community Builder/Cultural Energizer: Students will view a PowerPoint of photographs and art documenting the mass incarceration of all people of Japanese ancestry on the West Coast. Teachers may begin the lesson by modeling how to use an image as a source. After showing the first photo teachers might share what they noticed and thought about the photo. This would include:
a. A white woman pointing to a large sign hanging from the roof of the house, "Japs keep moving--This is a White Man's Neighborhood." She has a

stern look. The sign is hostile to Japanese Americans and suggests racism and prejudice towards them.

b. The caption lets us know the two signs in the window read, "Japs Keep Out" and "Member Hollywood Protective Association." She really does not want to have Japanese Americans in her neighborhood.

c. "Member of Hollywood Protective Association" suggests that there was an organized effort to keep Japanese Americans out. It suggests racism towards Japanese Americans in that time.

d. I also noticed that the date on the photo is 1920. That's two decades before World War II. Why is it in this slide show about the incarceration of people of Japanese Ancestry in World War II?

e. Modeling how to work with essential questions (articulated in step 2) by working with question #1: "What were the causes that led up to the mass incarceration of all people of Japanese ancestry during World War II?" I'm theorizing that racism was one reason Japanese Americans were incarcerated.

f.

After modeling, teachers will direct students to silently examine the rest of

the slide show, taking notes on what they see and what questions they have.

Following the slides, students can share their thinking with a partner before a

short class discussion.

2. Teachers will present essential questions and inquiry questions.

3. Students will read then discuss the historic overview and timeline annotating the overview with overlapping dates from the timeline that reinforce and inform the arguments framed in the overview, noting questions that the timeline raises. This gives students the opportunity to begin developing an argument about the causes and impact of the incarcerations. The two secondary sources provide historical context that allows students to better understand what they viewed in the primary source photographs and art created by incarcerees (see step 1). Students may also consult the map.

4. To close and to prepare for day 2, the class reads aloud the selected poems from the slideshow. Pause after each poem so the language of the incarcerees resonates

with students. Pausing allows students to experience empathy with the poets. For each poem, the students should briefly discuss in the context of the what happened during the removal and incarceration:
� What events experiences led the poet to write the poem? � What does the poem reveal about the impact of the incarceration on individuals, family, and community? � What words and phrases from in the poem support your response to question 2?

2. Teacher introduces inquiry questions for the day.

1. "What can we learn from poetry written during the incarceration and written today about the impact of incarceration on individuals, communities, and the nation?"
2. "What evidence do you see that supports the argument of incarceration was a significant moment in history and peoples' lives?"
o To help students respond to this question have them consider the following questions that focus on a criteria for identifying historical
significance:[13]
1. Who was affected by the event? Why was it important to them?
2. Was the experience profound, deeply affecting people's lives?
3. Did the experience affect many or few people?
4. Was the impact of the event long lasting or only short-lived?
5. Is the event relevant to our understanding of the past and/or present?
3. Students will dig deep into the historical and contemporary poems and interpret them to answer the inquiry questions. Teachers will pass out poetry handout and review directions with class.
4. Directions for Individual Work (10 minutes) 5. Scan the poems, then select 2�3 for focus. Be sure to select poems written while in
camp and a contemporary poem. In the interest of time, this selection could be made by the teacher, but it could also be made by individual students or small groups of students. After the poems are selected, place each poem's number in the left-hand column of the handout, and then have students respond to the questions in each of the four columns to the right. 6. Group Work (20 minutes)

Share your poems. Then make a poster��a word drawing using your words and drawing to show the impact of the incarceration to the Japanese Americans and the nation. Think about why this experience is significant today. Include lines and words from both the historical and contemporary poems in the graphic. Your drawing, lines, and words are your evidence. Have fun! Post and share your word drawing for a gallery walk.
7. Gallery walk and discussion. If possible, work as a whole group during the gallery walk. As you look at the posters consider the inquiry questions and discuss how the posters address them.
8. Final reflection��considering the materials you studied in this lesson, explain why the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World is a significant moment in American history and an important story to include in an ethnic studies course? Teacher may ask students to write a one-page reflection as homework and for assessment.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 14 of the framework includes a section (pages 294�297) on California's involvement in World War II and specifically mentions the breach of civil right for Japanese Americans. The chapter highlights using sources including literature, art, and music to understand the experiences of AAPI communities. Two guiding questions for this chapter include:
How did World War II impact California?
What external forces shape people's lives and make them who they are?

Historical Overview of the Japanese American Incarceration
Between 1942 and 1945, the US government forced more than 120,000 Japanese Americans from their homes, farms, schools, jobs, and businesses, in violation of their constitutional civil rights and liberties. Within hours after the attack by the imperial forces of Japan on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii on December 7, 1941, Japanese community leaders, language school instructors, Buddhist and Shinto priests were rounded up as "enemy aliens." The United States soon entered World War II. Three decades of anti-Japanese prejudice culminated into hate and suspicion. All people of Japanese descent in Hawaii and the West Coast were looked upon as saboteurs, spies, and as scapegoats for the attack in Hawaii.
On the West Coast, in the aftermath a hysteria of fear against Japanese Americans as "the enemy within" was created by inflammatory journalism, pressure groups, agricultural interests, politicians, and the US Army. This suspicion of Japanese Americans quickly led to cries for their expulsion. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, which called for the mass exclusion and incarceration of all Japanese Americans from the West Coast--where the majority of Japanese Americans lived, outside of Hawaii.
Mass exclusion and incarceration of Japanese Americans began in March 1942. Some communities like Terminal Island were given only 48 hours notice. During the first phase, incarcerees were transported on trains and buses under military guard to the hastily prepared temporary detention centers.
Twelve temporary detention centers were in California and one was in Oregon. They were set up on race tracks, fairgrounds, or livestock pavilions. Detainees were housed in horse stalls or windowless shacks that were crowded and lacked sufficient ventilation, electricity, and sanitation facilities. Food was often spoiled. There was a shortage of food and medicine. The War Relocation Authority, or WRA, was established to administer the centers.

The second phase began midsummer and involved moving approximately 500 incarcerees daily from the temporary detention centers to permanent concentration camps. These camps were located in remote, uninhabitable areas in the interior of the US. In the desert camps, daytime temperatures often reached 100 degrees or more. Sub-zero winters were common in the northern camps.
Japanese Americans filed lawsuits to stop the mass incarceration, but the wartime courts supported military necessity. The US Supreme Court ruled in Hirabayashi v US, Yasui v US, and Korematsu v US that the denial of civil liberties based on military necessity. In a later ruling in Endo v. US, the Supreme Court decided in 1945 that a loyal citizen could no longer be detained, but not until the war was winding down. Tule Lake camp closed in 1946.
The American concentration camps were surrounded by barbed wire and guard towers. Armed guards patrolled the perimeter and were instructed to shoot anyone attempting to leave. The barracks consisted of tar paper over two-by-sixes and no insulation. Many families were assigned to one barracks and lived together with no privacy. Meals were taken communally in mess halls and required a long wait in line. A demonstration in Manzanar over the theft of food by personnel led to violence in which two died and many were injured. The attempt at screening for loyalty and registering inmates for military induction with the WRA's questionnaire "Application for Leave Clearance," was conducted in a manner fraught with such confusion and distrust that violence broke out at both California camps.
Through the incarceration program, the Japanese Americans suffered greatly. They first endured the shock of realizing they could not return to their communities, but imprisoned behind barbed wire without due process without charges, hearings, or a trial. They lost their homes and businesses. Their education and careers were interrupted and their possessions lost. Many lost sons who fought for the country that imprisoned their parents. They suffered the loss of faith in the government and the humiliation of being confined as `enemy aliens' and prisoners in their own country.
Many young Japanese American men fought for the United States while their families were imprisoned. The segregated, all-Japanese American 100th Battalion /442nd Regimental Combat Team that fought in Europe and became the most highly decorated unit for its size and length of service in US military history, is one example of this irony. Other Japanese Americans also served secretly and with distinction in the Military Intelligence Service in the Pacific theater, becoming America's "secret weapon."
Throughout World War II, not a single incident of espionage or sabotage was found to be committed by Japanese Americans. Japanese Americans living in Hawaii were spared en masse removal because of the logistical difficulty of transporting a third of the state's population to the mainland. With their numbers exceeding the entire Japanese population on the mainland, Japanese Americans in Hawaii proved an essential part of the state's labor force and defense.
On December 17, 1944, President Roosevelt announced the end of the exclusion of Japanese Americans from the West Coast, thus allowing the return home of the incarcerees. Resettlement

after incarceration was difficult, especially since prejudice still ran high on the West Coast. Many Issei (first generation Japanese Americans) never regained their losses, living out their lives in poverty and poor health.
On July 31, 1980, Congress established the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians (CWRIC) to investigate causes of the Executive Order 9066. The Commission concluded: "the promulgation of Executive Order 9066 was not justified by military necessity and the decisions which followed from it-detention, ending detention, and ending exclusion-were not driven by analysis of military conditions. The broad historical causes which shaped these decisions were race prejudice, war hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."
In October 1983, in response to a petition for a writ of error Coram Nobis by Fred Korematsu, the Federal District Court of San Francisco vacated his 1942 federal conviction based on new evidence that revealed the government knowledge about unconstitutional race-based rationale behind military necessity, and intentionally covered it up all the way up to the Supreme Court.
After two decades of civic engagement and public advocacy, a petition for redress was won, an incredible milestone in American constitutional history. On August 10, 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed into law The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which offered an apology on behalf of the nation, and monetary restitution to the former incarcerees still living. Nearly half of those who had been imprisoned died before the bill was signed and monetary compensation was issued. Created by the passage of the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, was the federal Civil Liberties Public Education Fund to educate the public on the issues surrounding the wartime incarceration of individuals of Japanese descent, and to publish and distribute the hearings, findings, and recommendations of the Commission. After its expiration, in 1998, the California legislature passed a bill for the California Civil Liberties Public Education Program, which would support the development of educational resources about WWII incarceration and the importance of protecting civil liberties, even in times of national crisis.

Handout: The Power of Primary Source Poetry
Inquiry Questions:
What can we learn of the experience of Japanese American incarcerees from poetry?
How can poetry be a primary source?
You will work in a group. First individually scan the poems then read a poem or several short poems (15 minutes). Be sure to read poems written while in camp and contemporary poems. Consider what events the writer experienced that would have led them to write the poem. What led you to this conclusion? How does the poet seem to feel about the event? What key words

and phrases led you to this conclusion? Write down the line or phrase (or word) that you find most powerful. What do you like about that line or phrase? What question does the poem prompt you to ask? (either about the poet, life in general)

Poetry Written in American Concentration Camps by People of Japanese Ancestry
Haiku and Senyo In this desolate field Where only weeds have grown For millions of years, We mournfully bury Three comrades Who died in vain. Sojin Takei When the war is over And after we are gone Who will visit This lonely grave in the wild Where my friend lies buried? Keiho Soga There is no fence High up in the sky. The evening crows Fly up and disappear Into the endless horizon Sojin Takei

Two Poems by Toyo Suyemoto Kawakami[15]
Barracks Home This is our barracks, squatting on the ground, Tar papered shacks, partitioned into rooms By sheetrock walls, transmitting every sound Of neighbor's gossip or the sweep of brooms The open door welcomes the refugees, And now at least there is no need to roam Afar: here space enlarges memories Beyond the bounds of camp and this new home. The floor is carpeted with dust, wind-borne Dry alkali, patterned with insect feet, What peace can such a place as this impart? We can but sense, bewildered and forlorn, That time, disrupted by the war from neat Routines, must now adjust within the heart. Gain I sought to seed the barren earth And make wild beauty take Firm root, but how could I have known The waiting long would shake Me inwardly, until I dared Not say what would be gain From such untimely planting, or

That Damned Fence[16]
They've sunk the posts deep into the ground They've strung out wires all the way around. With machine gun nests just over there, And sentries and soldiers everywhere. We're trapped like rats in a wired cage, To fret and fume with impotent rage; Yonder whispers the lure of the night, But that DAMNED FENCE assails our sight. They've sunk the posts deep into the ground They've strung out wires all the way around. With machine gun nests just over there, And sentries and soldiers everywhere. We're trapped like rats in a wired cage, To fret and fume with impotent rage; Yonder whispers the lure of the night, But that DAMNED FENCE assails our sight. We seek the softness of the midnight air, But that DAMNED FENCE in the floodlight glare Awakens unrest in our nocturnal quest, And mockingly laughs with vicious jest. With nowhere to go and nothing to do, We feed terrible, lonesome, and blue:

That DAMNED FENCE is driving us crazy, Destroying our youth and making us lazy. Imprisoned in here for a long, long time, We know we're punished�though we've committed no crime, Our thoughts are gloomy and enthusiasm damp, To be locked up in a concentration camp. Loyalty we know, and patriotism we feel, To sacrifice our utmost was our ideal, To fight for our country, and die, perhaps; But we're here because we happen to be Japs. We all love life, and our country best, Our misfortune to be here in the west, To keep us penned behind that DAMNED FENCE, Is someone's notion of NATIONAL DEFENCE! Anonymous

Contemporary Poems and Spoken Word
"Kenji"[18]
(Spoken word poem: www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BJjo0BCbGo)
My father came from Japan in 1905 He was 15 when he immigrated from Japan

He worked until he was able to buy respect and build a store Let me tell you the story in the form of a dream, I don't know why I have to tell it but I know what it means, Close your eyes, just picture the scene, As I paint it for you, it was World War II, When this man named Kenji woke up, Ken was not a soldier, He was just a man with a family who owned a store in LA, That day, he crawled out of bed like he always did, Bacon and eggs with wife and kids, He lived on the second floor of a little store he ran, He moved to LA from Japan, They called him 'Immigrant,' In Japanese, he'd say he was called "Issei," That meant 'First Generation In The United States,' When everybody was afraid of the Germans, afraid of the Japs, But most of all afraid of a homeland attack, And that morning when Ken went out on the doormat, His world went black 'cause, Right there; front page news, Three weeks before 1942, "Pearl Harbour's Been Bombed And The Japs Are Comin'," Pictures of soldiers dyin' and runnin', Ken knew what it would lead to,

Just like he guessed, the President said, "The evil Japanese in our home country will be locked away," They gave Ken, a couple of days, To get his whole life packed in two bags, Just two bags, couldn't even pack his clothes, Some folks didn't even have a suitcase, to pack anything in, So two trash bags is all they gave them, When the kids asked mom "Where are we goin'?" Nobody even knew what to say to them, Ken didn't wanna lie, he said "The US is lookin' for spies, So we have to live in a place called Manzanar, Where a lot of Japanese people are," Stop it don't look at the gunmen, You don't wanna get the soldiers wonderin', If you gonna run or not, 'Cause if you run then you might get shot, Other than that try not to think about it, Try not to worry 'bout it; bein' so crowded, Someday we'll get out, someday, someday. As soon as war broke out The F.B.I. came and they just come to the house and "You have to come" "All the Japanese have to go" They took Mr. Ni

People didn't understand Why did they have to take him? Because he's an innocent laborer So now they're in a town with soldiers surroundin' them, Every day, every night look down at them, From watch towers up on the wall, Ken couldn't really hate them at all; They were just doin' their job and, He wasn't gonna make any problems, He had a little garden with vegetables and fruits that, He gave to the troops in a basket his wife made, But in the back of his mind, he wanted his families life saved, Prisoners of war in their own damn country, What for? Time passed in the prison town, He wondered if they would live it down, if and when they were free, The only way out was joinin' the army, And supposedly, some men went out for the army, signed on, And ended up flyin' to Japan with a bomb, That 15 kilotonne blast, put an end to the war pretty fast, Two cities were blown to bits; the end of the war came quick, Ken got out, big hopes of a normal life, with his kids and his wife, But, when they got back to their home, What they saw made them feel so alone,

These people had trashed every room, Smashed in the windows and bashed in the doors, Written on the walls and the floor, "Japs not welcome anymore." And Kenji dropped both of his bags at his sides and just stood outside, He, looked at his wife without words to say, She looked back at him wiping tears away, And, said "Someday we'll be OK, someday," Now the names have been changed, but the story's true, My family was locked up back in '42, My family was there it was dark and damp, And they called it an internment camp When we first got back from camp... uh It was... pretty... pretty bad I, I remember my husband said "Are we gonna stay 'til last?" Then my husband died before they close the camp. Mike Shinoda
SILENCE...NO MORE [19]
Silence, forty years of silence Forty years of anger, pain, helplessness Shackled in the hearts of Issei, Nisei, Kibei.* Many died in silence Some by their own hands

We Came Back for You [20]
We came back for you because...we know mass incarceration. We came back for you because...we know family separation.

We came back for you because...we know deportation. Because...we know barbed wire. Because...we know indefinite detention. We came back for you because...we care. Some say, "It's not our fight, it's not the same." But we say incarceration of innocent people is inhumane, we say mothers and children are not to blame. Back in 1942, we disappeared. Empty chairs in the classroom, empty homes, shops, and farms. America turned their backs on us. No one marched, no one protested, there were no petitions, there was no outrage. Silence filled the empty spaces of our invisibility. Silence was the scourge of our trauma. Silence filled our hearts, our homes, our community so... We came back to let you know that we will not forget you. We came back to drum our message loud and clear. We came back to hang paper cranes of hope and caring. We didn't know there would be a healing for us. We didn't know that you would cry listening to our stories. We didn't know that the power of our shared voices would be like shards ripping away the scabs of silence. We didn't know that the small act of folding a paper crane

would speak to so many people in our community. In protest we chanted, we raised our fists, we sang in Spanish, "De colores." We held hands, we sang in Japanese, "Kutsu ga Naru." We sang for our grandmothers and grandfathers, We sang for our mothers and fathers, And we sang for you. And in return you reached into your brown paper bag and tied a string bracelet to my wrist, You pushed a tortilla through the chain-link fence, You welcomed us wearing ties and hats, You even saved a rock from the old swimming pool, placed it in my hand, saying You had been waiting years for me to come back. Your big brown eyes stared up at me as tears welled up in mine. Little child, you are me. I am you. We will not forget you. We will not be silent. We will come back for you. And we will bring others until you are free! Satsuki Ina Bibliography Fort Minor - Kenji Lyrics | AZLyrics.com. https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/fortminor/kenji.html.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Indian Americans are thought to be relatively new immigrants to the United States and California, but their story in California starts much further back in history. In the time that they have lived in California, the contributions of Indian Americans to STEM fields and arts and culture encompasses a rich and diverse breadth and depth.
Students will be introduced to the history of Indian American migration and will highlight the diversity of the Indian American community with respect to religion and geography.
Key Terms and Concepts: Immigration Act, model-minority, Bollywood, media literacy, intercultural relations
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. understand the diversity inherent in the Indian American community with respect to language, religion, and geography;
2. understand Indian American migration to Northern California;
3. articulate the contributions of Indian Americans to the information technology and telecommunications lexicon, and the fields of STEM, arts and culture; and
4. further develop their oral presentation, public speaking, and analysis skills via the cultural analysis assignment.
Essential Questions:

1. What is the history of Indian American migration to the United States, and in particular, to California?
2. What role did opportunities for education and gender equality play in decisions to emigrate to California?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1
1. Introduce the first group of Indians who landed on Angel Island in the early 1900s, how they settled in Northern California and created a farming community. Also provide an introduction where a second generation of Indians who came to the United States in the later 1900s mainly seeking education, career opportunities and gender equality.
2. Following the introduction, screen a YouTube lesson, "Sikh Pioneers and their Contributions to California's History." Before starting the video, tell students that they are responsible for taking thorough notes (refer to the graphic organizer or note taking tool) and will be expected to have a discussion around the following questions:
a. Why did the first Indian Americans settle in Northern California?
b. What crops did these Indian Americans specialize in?
c. What US laws negatively affected their liberty and freedom?
i. Law of 1913, Foreigners without the option of citizenship
ii. Immigration Act of 1917, restricting the entry of more Asians into the country, preventing immigrants from bringing their families
d. How did these laws affect the social changes of these communities?
e. How have current immigration and naturalization laws changed since 1917?
3. Provide the following key terms for students to define using context clues from the film

a. Punjabi
b. Sikh
c. Immigration Act
d. Naturalization
e. Indian-Mexican marriages
4. Following the video, divide the students into groups of four to five. Each group is given 20 minutes to read the excerpt below, discuss the video, respond to the questions like the ones above,
a. The origins of the Punjabi-Mexican community lie in the Imperial Valley along California's southern border. Men from India's Punjab province stood out from the start among the pioneers who flocked there to work the newly arable land. Their fortunes, their legal status, and local opinion of them varied over the years. At first, South Asians could obtain American citizenship, but later they lost that right. Then not only the physical landscape but the political landscape and their place in it struck the Punjabi men as decidedly similar to their status in British India. They fought hard for their rightful place in society, and particularly for a place on the land, a very important component of Punjabi identity. The Imperial Valley was being transformed from a barren desert to a major center of agricultural production in California at the time the Punjabis arrived; the pioneer Anglo settlers there did not easily accept the Punjabis' claims to membership in the community they were building. Legal constraints and social stereotypes based on race and national origin helped determine the opportunities and working conditions the Punjabis encountered as they worked alongside others to develop the valley.
5. While students are working in groups, write down the key terms on the white board, leaving plenty of room between each. After the time has expired, signal to students that it is time to come back together. Facilitate a discussion where students are able to respond to each of the guiding questions aloud. Finally, ask one member from each group to go to the board. Each student is assigned a word and is expected to write their definition of the word with their group's effort. After completing the task,

the class talks through each term. Provide additional information, examples, and support to better clarify and define the terms.

6. Close with student and community reflection.

about Bhagat Singh Thind. Additionally, ask students to read an excerpt from "Roots

In the Sand" that discusses the ruling of the Circuit Court of Appeals of United States

v. Bhagat Singh Thind

2.

261 US 204 (1923). Ask the students to pay special attention as to why he

i. Ask the question, "how do you (or your family members) answer the race question on a form? What are the options listed?"

ii. How is the term "white" defined racially?: (10 min)

b. From US vs Bhagat Singh Thind: The court conceded that Indians were "Caucasians" and that anthropologists considered them to be of the same race as white Americans, but argued that "the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences."

i. What do you think of the argument that courts made about people from Indian origin? What do you know about people from Indian origin today?

Additional Material and Resources to support Day 2

Pre 1800

Beginning in the 17th century, the East India Company (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company) began bringing indentured Indian servants to the American colonies.[ 11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-Thakur-11)

The Naturalization Act of 1790 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalization_Act_of_1790) made Asians ineligible for citizenship.[12] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-12)

19th century

The first significant wave of Indian immigrants entered the United States in the 19th century. Emigration from India was driven by difficulties facing Indian farmers, including the challenges posed by the British land tenure system for small landowners, and by drought and food shortages, which worsened in the 1890s.

At the same time, Canadian steamship companies, acting on behalf of Pacific coast employers, recruited Sikh farmers with economic opportunities in British Columbia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia).

Racist attacks in British Columbia, however, prompted Sikhs and new Sikh immigrants to move down the Pacific Coast to Washington (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)) and Oregon (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon), where they worked in lumber mills (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumber_mill) and in the railroad industry.[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-ReferenceA-14). Many Punjabi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjabis) Sikhs who settled in California, around

the Yuba City (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuba_City) area, formed close ties with Mexican Americans.[11] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_noteThakur-11). The presence of Indian Americans also helped develop interest in Eastern religions in the US and would result in its influence on American philosophies such as Transcendentalism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism).
Swami Vivekananda (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Vivekananda) arriving in Chicago at the World's Fair led to the establishment of the Vedanta Society (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedanta_Society).
20th century
Between 1907 and 1908, Sikhs moved further south to warmer climates in California, where they were employed by various railroad companies. Some white Americans, resentful of economic competition and the arrival of people from different cultures, responded to Sikh immigration with racism and violent attacks.[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-ReferenceA-14)
The Bellingham riots (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellingham_riots) in Bellingham, Washington on September 5, 1907 epitomized the low tolerance in the US for Indians and Sikhs, who were called "hindoos" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindoos) by locals.
In the early twentieth century, a range of state and federal laws restricted Indian immigration and the rights of Indian immigrants in the US. In the 1910s, American nativist organizations campaigned to end immigration from India, culminating in the passage of the Barred Zone Act (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_Zone_Act) in 1917.
In 1913, the Alien Land Act of California prevented Sikhs (in addition to Japanese and Chinese immigrants) from owning land., it was legal for "brown" races to mix. Many Indian men, especially Punjabi men, married Hispanic women and Punjabi-Mexican marriages became a norm in the West.[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-ReferenceA-14) [16] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-Oxford_University_Press-16)
Bhicaji Balsara (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhicaji_Balsara) became the first known Indian to gain naturalized US citizenship. As a Parsi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsi), he was considered a "pure member of the Persian sect" and therefore a "free white

person." In 1910, the Circuit Court of Appeal agreed that Parsis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsis) are classified as white.[17] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-auto-17). Between 1913 and 1923, about 100 Indians were naturalized.
In 1923, the Supreme Court of the United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States) ruled in United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Bhagat_Singh_Thind) that Indians were ineligible for citizenship because they were not "free white persons".[14] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans#cite_note-ReferenceA-14). Over fifty Indians had their citizenship revoked after this decision, in 1927. However, no other naturalization was permitted after the ruling, which led to about 3,000 Indians leaving the United States.
1993 and 1994 Sandhu vs Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (California Superior Court (1993) and California Sixth District Court of Appeals (1994) (Sandhu had sued his employer, Lockheed, for discrimination based on race. Lockheed's position was that they did not discriminate against Sandhu, a Punjabi Indian, because he was considered Caucasian (Lockheed argued that the "common popular understanding that there are three major human races--Caucasoid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race), Mongoloid (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongoloid), and Negroid" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negroid). This comes from a nineteenth century classification of races). In 1993, the court ruled in favor of Lockheed. In 1994, the Californian Sixth District Court of Appeals overturned that decision and ruled in favor of Sandhu, stating that Indians were a distinct ethnic group of their own.)

Sample Lesson 31: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the Model Minority Myth
Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 5 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Research Evidence and Point of View 1�3 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 2, 8, 9; WHST.9�10.1A and B; SL.9�10.1A-D, 9-10.3 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a Lesson Overview: This three-day lesson introduces students to the complexity of the term "Asian American," ultimately coming to understand the various ethnic groups and politics associated with the identity marker. Additionally, students will also be exposed to the concept of the model minority myth. This course will provide for students the implications that result when lumping all Asian groups together and labeling them the Model Minority. For example, marginalized groups (i.e.,

Pacific Islanders, Southeast Asians) suffer from being cut out of programs and resources. It presents a false narrative that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) have overcome racism and prejudice. It glosses over the violence, harm and legalized racism that AAPIs have endured, i.e., the Chinese massacre in Los Angeles 1871, the annexation of Hawaii, shooting of Southeast Asian school children in Stockton. Furthermore, students will understand how this label for AAPIs becomes a hindrance to expanding democratic structures and support, and worst how it creates a division among the AAPI community and places a wedge between them and other oppressed groups including but not limited to African American, Latinx, and American Indian communities.

Lesson Steps/Activities:

Day 1
1. Place four large pieces of flip chart paper in each corner of the room along with three to five markers. Engage the class by asking students What does Asian American mean? What does Pacific Islander mean?
2. Before delving too deeply into discussion, divide the class up into four groups. Each group is assigned to a corner and instructed to take 10 minutes as a group to respond to the aforementioned question. Also ask the groups to list the various ethnic groups that comprise "Asian American and Pacific Islander."
3. After about 10 minutes, signal for the groups to stop what they are doing. Allow each group to share what they discussed with the class. After each group has shared, provide a definition for Asian American and Pacific Islander and begin listing some of the various ethnic groups (see below for a sample list).
Sample Ethnic Groups (this list is in no way exhaustive��listed in the order of population according to the 2010 Census):

Definition of Asian American: The term Asian American was born out of the Asian American Movement (1968�1975) as a means of identifying people of Asian descent living in the United States. During the late 1960s, the term was largely seen as radical and unifying, a rejection of "oriental" and other pejoratives that were associated with people of Asian descent. The collective coining of the term was an act of self-naming and self-determination, and aligned with the broader goals of the Asian American and Pacific Islander movement-- equality, justice, and anti-racism.
4. After sharing the definition and ethnic groups listed above, reiterate that Asian American and Pacific Islander is a loaded term that encompasses dozens of different Asian ethnic groups that have settled in the US, with large populations settling in California.
5. Ask students if they know what the model minority myth is. If students are able to answer, move to the article. If not, describe the model minority myth and explain to the students that they will be examining the effects of racial stereotypes that are perceived to be positive can in fact be harmful. For example, the teacher can describe the effects of stereotype threat.

6. Ask students to read the article "'Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial Wedge Between Asians And Blacks' in Code Switch (see link in resource list). Note that this article references William Petersen's 1966 New York Times article that inherently pitted Japanese Americans (arguably Asian Americans more broadly) against African Americans, with Petersen identifying the latter group as the "problem minority." Following internment, Japanese Americans were able to achieve some level of social and economic mobility, rendering them the "model minority," for their ability to thrive in the face of adversity unlike their African American counterparts. After reading the NPR piece, explain to students that the Petersen article is first time the term "model minority" was used (or coined) and marks the beginning of the stereotyping of Asian Americans as inherently "smart" and "successful". Ask students to reflect on the main points of the NPR article and discuss how and why the model minority myth is used as a wedge group.
Create a chart of arguments and counter arguments.
Sample Chart (Create more arguments and counter arguments through class discussions.)
Arguments of the Model Minority Myth Counter Arguments to the Model Minority Myth

All Asians are smart and successful

Not all AAPI are successful and rich, in fact the majority are working class and live in poverty. Especially when data is disaggregated by ethnic group for example the poverty rate among Pacific Islanders, Cambodian and Hmong Americans is considerably higher than Indian and Chinese Americans. Lumping all Asians together covers over the disparities within and among the AAPI population. It renders these groups invisible and hurts the poorest groups who need financial aid and assistance. (If there are Asian students in the class, make an effort to draw out their experiences in group and whole class discussions as a part of sharing their stories.)

Asians are the model minority because they overcome adversity better than African Americans

It's a form of anti-black racism. The model minority myth has been used to put a wedge between the AAPI and African American communities and is an effort to peel off AAPIs from the Civil Rights Movement. It has also been used by the media to disparage the African American community for standing up for their rights.
"During World War II, the media created the idea that the Japanese were rising up out of the ashes [after being held in incarceration camps] and proving that they had the right cultural stuff," said Claire Jean Kim, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. "And it was immediately a reflection on black people: Now why weren't black people making it, but Asians were?"
These arguments falsely conflate anti-Asian racism with anti-black racism, according to Kim. "Racism that Asian-Americans have experienced is not what black people have experienced," Kim said. "Sullivan is right that Asians have faced various forms of discrimination, but never the systematic dehumanization that black people have faced during slavery and continue to face today." Asians have been barred from entering the US and gaining citizenship and have been sent to incarceration camps, Kim pointed out, but

(continued)
All Asians are good at math and computers, they are nerdy. All Asians are...

(continued) all that is different than the segregation, police brutality and discrimination that AfricanAmericans have endured." (Chow, Kat)
It is important that AAPIs not only stand up for their rights but also stand with African Americans in support of the Black Lives Matter Movement and support the end to police brutality. Justice for one oppressed group leads to justice for all.
Not all AAPIs are good at math or want to be mathematicians or scientists. Parent, peer, media pressure to do well in math and become a scientists, doctor or lawyer is very limiting to AAPI youth, and causes them to feel like failures, if they don't live up to these stereotypes.
(Counter Argument)

Day 2
1. Start the class by asking students to share their counter arguments with the groups that they were in yesterday. After each group mate has shared their counter arguments, ask the groups to share what they believe to be the strongest counter argument with the entire class.
2. Be sure to provide your own analysis of Petersen's article and a counter argument. Stress that Petersen's article and the term "model minority" helped render "Asian American" monolithic. Also point out that the experience that Petersen mentioned was not reflective of all Asian Americans, as Southeast Asian and Pacific Islander ethnic groups remain largely

marginalized and are disproportionately impacted by poverty, mental health issues, lowwage jobs, access to higher education, among other barriers.
3. To better illustrate the problems with "model minority," play a short video, "Why Data Matters When It Comes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Education" (see resources). Following the screening, explain what it means to disaggregate data and its connection to the model minority myth.
4. Point back to the flip chart papers around the room that lists the various ethnic groups within AAPI. Underscore how this term that was intended to be a unifying identity marker has created some problems, including rendering smaller ethnic groups (often those in the most need) less visible, and not being inclusive enough of a term, especially for those of the Asian diaspora that have origins from islands in the Pacific (i.e., Filipinos, Melanesians, Polynesians, etc.), hence the more updated identity-marker, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
5. During the second half of class, hand out copies of the law signed by Governor Brown on September 25, 2016, California Assembly Bill 1726 (Data Collection). Have students take turns reading the bill aloud popcorn style. After the in-class reading, provide necessary context on what a bill is, and summarize how bills become laws. Additionally, define any words or terms students may be struggling with. In groups, have students discuss the purpose of the bill, impact that it will have on AAPI communities, and how the legislation helps dispel the model minority myth.
6. As homework, ask students to complete a "mini bill analysis" of Assembly Bill 1726 using the worksheet below.
Day 3
The key method to dispel the model minority myth is by telling the true stories of yourself, your family and your community. By writing down, speaking aloud and sharing your stories, you actively counteract the stereotypes and master narrative developed to pigeon hold Asian American and Pacific Islanders as a monolithic group with one identity, one experience, and one role. No AAPI individual fits the model minority stereotype in all its facets. Take time in your class for students to first Think, Write, and then Share on three questions:
1. What is your ethnic background?

2. What stereotype is there of your ethnic group that you do not identify with? Why? Explain in detail with facts about your experience, your background, your values, your goals, your dreams, your family, your community.
3. How will you actively dispel these stereotypes?
Application, Action, and Reflection: Students will read and analyze an article and legislative document, providing their own informed critiques, opinions, and feedback on the sources. Students will further analyze how the document supports or argues against the model minority myth. Students will also tell their stories as a way to dispel the harmful stereotypes that the media and society imposes on their ethnic group.

Lesson Purpose and Overview
Overview: Cambodian Americans, are a sub Asian American group that are experiencing numerous deportations as a result of a repatriation act passed in the 1990s. This act focuses on deporting Cambodian Americans with felony convictions for petty crimes even after they have served their time. Over 1,000 Cambodian Americans have been deported back to Cambodia to live in a society that is unwelcoming to them and where they often do not have any family or social connections. They are culturally American yet they are barred from ever returning to the US. Many of them have wives and children in the US. These family separations are causing generational trauma to the wives, children and parents. They are forced to live in a "borderland" as they are also not treated as equals in Cambodia. This criminalization of Cambodian male youth mirrors the experiences of Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x youth with the added Cambodian US repatriation act. Fortunately, there are organizations recognizing this is a human rights issue and are making this issue known.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� understand the history of how the US involvement in the Vietnam War drew Cambodia into political turmoil leading to the killing fields forcing many Cambodians to flee to the US as refugees;
� understand the specific issues that Cambodian Americans face, high poverty rates, high incarceration rates, and high rates of deportations;
� understand the school to prison to deportation pipeline affecting Cambodian American youth; and
� understand the impact of these deportations on the Cambodian American community.
Key Terms and Concepts

Cambodia � Southeast Asian country that got caught in the Vietnam War due to the secret bombings
Immigration Naturalization Act � This law defines who can immigrate to the US and causes for deportation.
US involvement in the Vietnam War � During the Cold War era, the US became militarily involved in the Vietnam War to stop the spread of communism. The war spread to neighboring Southeast Asian countries, like Cambodia and Laos, causing instability, chaos, death, destruction, and a refugee crisis.
US secret bombing of Cambodia � From 1969 to 1973, under the Nixon administration, the US Air Force secretly dropped bombs in Cambodian near the border of Vietnam to try to destroy the Ho Chi Minh trails that the Viet Cong used to travel down to South Vietnam to attack.
Pol Pot � The communist leader who fought the US backed Cambodian government who took power and tried to weed out anything that had any US or western influence as a reaction to the bombings. This caused a period of time called the Killing Fields in which 10� 30 percent of the population, or 1.2 million to 2.8 million people, were killed. (Heuveline).
Killing Fields � genocide in which the Cambodian government killed any person suspected of siding with the US or being influenced by the US, including doctors, teachers, and educated persons.
Refugee � a person forced to leave their home country for fear of losing their lives, or of suffering.
Khmer Rouge � Pol Pot's political organization that was staffed with youth and child soldiers.
Genocide � mass murder of an entire group of people.
Trauma � a deeply distressing or disturbing experience that causes negative psychological effects (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.).
Essential Questions

1. What is the history of Cambodian immigration to the US? Why and how did they come to the US? What are the social and cultural implications of Cambodia's turbulent history for Cambodian Americans today?
2. Describe the Cambodian American community today, and in particular the issue of deportations that they are dealing with.
3. What impact are these deportations having on Cambodian American families and why are advocacy groups calling it a human rights issue?
4. What are the similarities in experiences faced by the Latinx families dealing with deportations of family members?
Background information:
� Refugees from Cambodia were the last large group of refugees to arrive in the United States following the end of the US war in Southeast Asia. Most were not able to leave Cambodia until the overthrow of the Pol Pot dictatorship in 1979, and many had to spend years in Thai refugee camps before they were allowed to come to the US.
� By the time Cambodian refugees finally arrived in the US, some local communities were facing economic challenges and were even less welcoming to the Cambodian refugees than they had been to earlier refugee groups. Government assistance programs were harder to qualify for. Cambodian refugees were often resettled in some of the most challenging American neighborhoods with issues of poverty, crime, and violence.
� Adults who dealt with post-traumatic stress issues from surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide, which killed 1.2�2.8 million people, which is 13 percent to 30 percent of the Cambodian population (Heuveline), were not trained in the detailed steps they needed to take so that they and their children could become fully naturalized US citizens. Family members at times experienced discrimination and hatred.
� Some young people growing up in rough neighborhoods got involved in youth gangs and crime. When a young Cambodian refugee was arrested, their parents were not familiar with the US justice system. The arrested youth were often advised to take a plea deal and plead guilty sometimes in exchange for a reduced sentence. In the years

after the 9-11-2001 terrorist attack, these young refugees who had already completed their prison terms, even decades earlier, faced deportation to Cambodia since they had not become naturalized US citizens.
� Most of those young people facing deportation do not remember Cambodia as they had spent most of their lives in the United States. Some of those facing deportation to Cambodia had never been there��they had been born in Thai refugee camps. Many of them had already moved on with their lives, gotten jobs, formed families, had US citizen children, and bought homes. Over 700 Cambodian refugees have been deported��the numbers of annual deportations have decreased and increased under different Presidential Administrations.
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Day 1
1. Ask the question � How many people know where Cambodia is on the world map? If a student raises their hand, ask them to come point out where it is on a world map or globe. Also project a picture of the Cambodian Flag on the screen if you are able.
2. Today we are going to learn about Cambodian Americans, their history of immigration to the US, and what issues they are facing today. (Read essential questions 1�3 aloud.)
3. In pairs, bring up the source "Cambodian Americans" http://www.asiannation.org/cambodian.shtml#sthash.G7I688Ox.dpbs and answer the questions on the handout "Cambodian Americans � Immigration and Experience in America."
4. Have students work in pairs to answer the questions on the hand out. They can take turns reading to each other and listening. Turn it in at the end of class.
Day 2
1. Jigsaw Export/Home groups � break students into groups of four and number them 1�4. Tell them they are currently in their home groups, and that each number is going to become an expert on a source that will give them more information about the deportation issue within the Cambodian American community.
2. Before they break into the expert groups � Discuss the deportation issue with your class, give a short 5�10 minute lecture on why and how are Cambodian Americans who were

born in refugee camps, have green cards, and have lived in the US the majority of their lives are now at risk of being deported.
Mini Lecture � According to the NPR article, "The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act," outlines how non-US citizens may be deported back to their country of origin, even if they're in the country legally. "Violation of law" is listed as a deportable offense.
The US has been repatriating Cambodian immigrants since 2002, when an agreement was made between Washington and Phnom Penh that said Cambodia would accept deportees. That deal fell apart last year, prompting the Trump administration to impose visa sanctions on some Cambodian officials and families. The two governments eventually worked out a new agreement in early 2018, and Cambodia began accepting Cambodian nationals, this time in even greater numbers than before. Many times Cambodian Americans are deported for a crime they committed when they were young and they did their time, they move on with their lives, marrying and having kids. As mature husbands and fathers, they are now being deported for something they thought was a part of their past and dealt with. (Check for understanding)
3. Expert Groups � Tell them they will be given a source to access online through their Chromebooks, or teachers can make hard copies and set up video watching stations and that while they are reading and watching to use critical literacy to think about the information they are learning. Questions they should think about while they are analyzing their sources are: 1. What is the legal basis for these deportations? 2. Why are these deportations unfair? 3. What effect are these deportations having on the deportees and the families still living in the U.S? 4. What groups are doing something about the deportations and what are they doing?
Since they will be the only person reporting back to their homegroup on their source, they really need to pay attention and take good notes. (All of these directions are on the two page handout. Make hard copies for every student).

4. Home Groups � Tell students to return to their home groups and report to their groups their findings from their sources. They take turns from 1�4 presenting their facts, quotes, and evidence while the rest of the group takes notes from listening to the expert. At the end of the time period, all of their quadrants should be filled out completely.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework
Chapter 15 asks students to learn about how the Cold War impacted Southeast Asian countries and the emergence of human rights concerns for the United States. Chapter 16 goes further to ask students to analyze the impact and experiences of refugees who fled Southeast Asia after war. Guiding questions from these chapters include: In what directions is California growing in the twenty-first century? How does the life of a new immigrant to the United States today compare with what it was in 1900? How do policies from the second half of the twentieth century compare with those of the early twenty-first century?
5. Assessment � 1. Reflect on your learning:
� What effects are these deportations having on the Cambodian American community?
� Why are advocacy groups calling these deportations a human rights violation?
6. Action:
To show evidence of your learning from this lesson you can choose one of the two options below:
� Write a letter or essay explaining your understanding of these issues based on your own critical analysis.
� Create a public service announcement that educates others about this issue.

Quick Fact Sheet on Deportations of Cambodian Americans After escaping the repressive regime of the Khmer Rouge and genocide, Cambodian refugees began immigrating at large into the US after 1979. They were dispersed into various cities and states throughout the US to encourage cultural assimilation. Many were resettled into underserved cities and neighborhoods that did not provide adequate educational, economic, and social support. Without an understanding of the unique needs and circumstances these refugees had endured due to war and genocide trauma, Cambodians were treated like voluntary migrants who were expected to achieve self-sufficiency and assimilate very quickly.
 Cambodian Americans experience disparate socio-economic impacts and face issues with poverty, lack of education, poor mental and physical health, and in more recent times, deportations back to Cambodia.
o 38% of Cambodians have Limited English Proficiency
o 32% have less than a high school education
o Only 17% have had any type of higher education
o 23% fall under low-income, which 20% of those living in poverty

o The per capita income of Cambodians in California is $16,249
 Cambodian refugees and immigrants after 1975 lawfully entered the United States and were legally resettled into this country. After living in the US for more than one year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service adjusted their status to become lawful permanent residents, which also protected them from deportation.
 However, the United States criminal justice system went through many changes in the last few decades, pushing toward a system of mass incarceration in this country. Specifically in 1996, President Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) and the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, which made Southeast Asian Americans and other immigrants who have certain criminal convictions now subject to harsh mandatory detention and automatic deportation laws with very few opportunities for relief.
 Additionally, Cambodia signed a repatriation agreement with the US in 2002. Deportations increased during the fall of 2017 when the Trump administration started placing visa sanctions on certain high-level Cambodian government officials until they start cooperating with US deportation policy. A nationwide temporary restraining order currently requires Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to send written notice to some Cambodians only two weeks before re-arresting them.
 One cannot understand Southeast Asian detentions and deportations without also discussing how these communities are policed and sentenced. During the prison boom of the 1990s, the Asian American and Pacific Islander prisoner population grew by 250%. During this time, Asian juveniles in California were more than twice as likely to be tried as adults compared to white juveniles who committed similar crimes. Arrests of AAPI youth in the United States increased 726% from 1977 to 1997. In cities such as Oakland, AAPI youth have had very high arrest rates: Cambodians with 63 per 1000 and Laotians with 52 per 1000. Many were advised to accept plea deals for shortened prison time, without being made aware that these decisions would make them eligible for deportation.
 With the 1996 laws, Southeast Asian Americans, which includes Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Laotian Americans, are 3�4 times more likely to be deported based on past criminal convictions, than any other immigrant group. Since 1998, at least 15,000 Southeast Asian Americans have received final orders of deportation, including over

2,000 orders for deportation to Cambodia, despite many arriving in the US with refugee status and obtaining a green card.  Many times Cambodian Americans are deported for a crime they committed when they were young and they did their time, they move on with their lives, marrying and having kids. As mature husbands and fathers, they are now being deported for something they thought was a part of their past and dealt with.

1912
The first Gurudwara (Sikh Temple) in the United States was established in 1912 in Stockton, California. Immigrants from India, usually men and generally from the region of Punjab, came to the United States to study, work on the Pacific & Eastern Railroad as construction workers, in lumberyards, or in agriculture. By 1910, 5,000 men had migrated to the West Coast of the United States from colonial India.
Many early immigrants were not able to bring family members to the United States with them, and few women were allowed to migrate, so many migrants inter-married with other groups, such as European Americans, Mexican Americans, or other Asian Americans. The PBS film, Roots in the Sand, documents the history of this community.

1917
In February 1917, during World War I, the US Congress passed the Immigration Act of 1917 (also known as the Asiatic Barred Zone Act). Although President Woodrow Wilson previously vetoed it in 1916, the congressional majority overrode the President's veto. The act added people originating from the Asiatic Barred Zone (see above) to the list of people who were considered "undesirable" for immigration to the US; the list also included: "homosexuals", "idiots", "feeble-minded persons", "criminals", "epileptics", "insane persons", "alcoholics," "professional beggars", all persons "mentally or physically defective", "polygamists," and "anarchists."

The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 had barred Chinese from entering the US, and the 1917 legislation expanded the categories to the entire Asian region. The rising "nativism" and "xenophobia" in the US led to the passage of the Act in prohibiting immigration of certain groups. Congress repealed the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1943 and the Luce-Cellar Act of 1946 ended discrimination against Asian Indians and Filipinos, who were accorded the right to naturalization, allowed a quota of 100 immigrants per year. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act allowed other Asian groups (Japanese, Korean, and others) to become naturalized US citizens.

Bhagat Singh Thind (who lived from 1892 to 1967) was born in Punjab, India and came to the US to study in 1913. He was enlisted to join the US military during World War I (in 1918). He was first granted US citizenship because his military service in 1918, but it was revoked four days later because citizenship was only available at the time for "free white men." Later, Thind brought a case to the Supreme Court (in 1923) arguing the immigrants from India to the US should be allowed to be naturalized citizens. The Supreme Court disagreed since only commonly understood "Caucasian" immigrants were eligible to become citizens. Thind finally became a citizen in 1936. He went on to study spirituality and lecture extensively in the US.

Dalip Singh Saund (who lived from 1899 to 1973) was the first Asian-American member of the US House of Representatives (Congress). He served as the Congressman from the 29th District of California from 1957;1963. He was born in Punjab, India while it was under British rule and migrated to the United States (via Ellis Island) in 1920 and pursued his Masters and Doctoral degrees at the University of California, Berkeley. He campaigned for the rights of South Asian immigrants in the United States. After the Luce-Celler Act was signed into law by then-President Harry Truman in 1946 (allowing for people from India and the Philippines to become naturalized US citizens), Saund could become a US citizen, and later, successfully ran for national office.

In 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Immigration Act of 1965, which changed US immigration policy. Previously, immigrants from Asia and Africa were allowed into the United States in very small numbers (even if they were highly educated or had family living in the US). The Act of 1965 was signed in from of the Statue of Liberty, on Liberty Island, and reflected the Civil Rights movement's gains for racial equality. US immigration policies had been severely discriminatory given decades of exclusion of non-European immigrants.
Departing from the previous system of country-based quotas, US immigration after 1965 has focused on the skills that immigrants bring and reunification of families (immigrants sponsoring their families to join them in the United States).

In 1987, a 30-year-old immigrant from India who worked in a bank, Navroze Mody, was brutally beaten to death by a group of teenagers who called themselves "Dotbusters." This group was active in New Jersey, where a large South Asian immigrant community is concentrated, and they had been harassing immigrants from South Asia for months. A month before Mody's killing, Dotbusters (referring to the bindi that Hindu women wear on their foreheads for religious purposes), sent a letter to a local newspaper. Part of their letter read:
"I'm writing about your article during July about the abuse of Indian People. Well I'm here to state the other side. I hate them, if you had to live near them you would also. We are an organization called dot busters. We have been around for 2 years. We will go to any extreme to get Indians to move out of Jersey City. If I'm walking down the street and I see a Hindu and the setting is right, I will hit him or her. We plan some of our most extreme attacks such as breaking windows, breaking car windows, and crashing family parties. ... They are a week race physically and mentally. We are going to continue our way. We will never be stopped."
In Jersey City, after Mody's death, another person of South Asian descent was assaulted by three men with baseball bats. Laws against hate crimes have been in existence in New Jersey though incidents still continue.

The federal government has ordered Hamtramck to print election ballots and other materials in the Bangla language. By Charles Sercombe.
Here's more proof that Hamtramck's Bengali community is a major voting bloc. The federal government is now requiring the city to print all election material, including ballots and candidate nominating petitions, in the Bangla language as well as in English.
That's because, according to the US Census, the Bangladeshi community is sizeable enough to warrant separate ballots. The agency said it used a variety of data to determine this mandate, but just what exactly the decision was based on was not immediately known.

Hamtramck is not alone in being ordered to print separate ballots. Some 248 voting districts across the country have been told to print up separate ballots for their dominant ethnic group. City Clerk Ed Norris said the mandate will mean an additional cost to the city, but he did not know how much more elections will now run.
He said there is not enough time to ready ballots for the Bengali community for the Nov. 8 General Election. The next election after the November election is the Republican Primary on Feb. 28. Norris said he's not sure if the additional ballots will be ready by then, either.
"We're going to try to comply the best we can, as soon as we can," he said. Part of the problem in getting ballots ready is finding both a reliable translation service, and a printer that has the proper font for the Bangla language. Another issue to figure out is who is responsible for preparing and paying for the separate ballots when elections are under the jurisdiction of the county or state.
Not all elections are solely city elections. Norris said trying to coordinate this mandate with county and state officials is another hurdle to jump. In the online social network site Facebook, there has been criticism of this mandate. There are some who believe that if you are a citizen and are eligible to vote, you should be able to understand the English language. But the Voting Rights Act of 2006 mandates special language ballots for there is a significant ethnic presence in a community. Norris said that there is no appeal option to challenge the mandate.
Norris added that the city has already provided some election material in Polish, Arabic and Bangla.

New York Neighbors is an inter-faith organization that uses the symbols of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to show how people of different backgrounds can get along.
In the weeks following the attacks on 9/11/2001, there were significant increases to bias incidents aimed at persons believed to be of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent. Many

groups came together to unite against extremism, and to understand individuals from different backgrounds in order to make sure that unfair laws and practices don't result in discriminatory treatment. One organization included the New York Neighbors.

On Sunday August 5, 2012, an armed gunman entered a Sikh temple (gurudwara) in Oak Creek, Wisconsin and opened fire on innocent people praying in their house of worship. Six people were killed (Seeta Singh, a priest; Parkash Singh, a priest; Ranjit Singh; Satwant Singh Kaleka, president of the temple; and Subegh Singh and Parmjit Kaur, temple members). Two other worshippers were injured. A police officer fatally shot the gunman, Wade Michael Page, aged 40. Wade Michael Page is reported to have been affiliated with white supremacist and hate groups and was on the watchlist of organizations that track hate crimes like the Southern Poverty Law Center.
After the shooting, President Obama released a statement that, "At this difficult time, the people of Oak Creek must know that the American people have them in our thoughts and prayers, and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who were killed and wounded. My Administration will provide whatever support is necessary to the officials who are responding to this tragic shooting and moving forward with an investigation. As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family."

Who are South Asian Americans?
Population of South Asians in the US (density)
According to the 2010 Census, approximately 4.3 million South Asians live in the USA. South Asian Americans trace their origins to Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. Some were born there, while others are descended from immigrants from these nations.
The community also includes double migrants--members of diasporic communities in the Caribbean (Guyana, Jamaica, Suriname, and Trinidad & Tobago), Africa (Kenya, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zanzibar), Canada, Europe, the Middle East, and the Pacific Rim (Fiji, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore) who have subsequently migrated to the US.
The South Asian American community is diverse not just in terms of national origin, but also in terms of ethnicity, religion, and language. South Asian Americans practice Buddhism,

Christianity, Hinduism, Jainism, Judaism, Islam, Sikhism, and Zoroastrianism; others have no faith. The most common languages spoken by South Asians in the United States, other than English, include Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi, Telugu, and Urdu.
South Asians are also diverse in terms of immigration and socioeconomic status. While many are citizens or permanent residents, thousands live here on short-term work visas or are undocumented. With respect to employment, there are notable concentrations of South Asians in tech and the health professions, in education, and in service work, taxi work, domestic work, and the hotel and restaurant industry.

Short Timeline of South Asian Americans in the US
[Key moments in US & world history are also presented in brackets]
1838: By 1838 approximately 25,000 Indian laborers have been transported as indentured workers to the British sugar colony of Mauritius. By 1917 more than 3.5 million South Asians will have been transported to European colonies in Africa, Caribbean, and the Pacific as indentured "coolies," often undertaking harsh work once performed by slaves for a "penny a day" as historians have noted. [Slavery was abolished throughout the British Empire in 1834 and in the US in 1865)
1880s & 1890s: Approximately 2,000 South Asians are residing in the US On the West Coast many are farmworkers from the Punjab region who are members of the Sikh faith. Others are students. [The modern nations of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Burma were all part of the British Empire from the mid-nineteenth century to the late 1940s.]
1907�1908: The Asian Exclusion League, an anti-immigrant nativist group, opposes immigration from Asia and sparks violent race riots against South Asians in Washington, California, and Oregon in

order to drive out "cheap labor." The Bureau of Naturalization issues directives to dissuade citizenship applications from "Hindoos" (a derogatory term inaccurately applied to all South Asians; of the early migrants, 85% were Sikh, about 13% Muslim, and only 2% Hindus).
1912�1913: Sikh migrants build the first gurdwara (Sikh Temple) in the US in Stockton, California in 1912. Founders of the Gurdwara were also founders of the Ghadar Party in 1913. Ghadar leaders galvanized a cross-class community of laborers and students to fight the British by connecting colonialism to the racist conditions of labor and life they experienced in the US. As the Ghadar Party expanded, it established official headquarters in San Francisco. Its leaders attracted the attention of the British government, who recruited US immigration officials to keep tabs on Indian nationalists in America, to limit the growing strength of Ghadar's revolutionary aims.
1917: Immigration Act of 1917 defines a geographic "barred zone" in the Asia-Pacific (including South Asia) from which no immigrants can come to the US [World War I lasts from 1914 to 1918]
1920: State Alien land laws prohibit transfer and ownership of land to noncitizens; as a consequence Indian farmers lose over 120,000 acres in California. In the following years, over 3,000 Indians return to their homeland due to xenophobic pressures. Migrants still come to the US as traders or merchants through port cities such as New Orleans or New York, and some settle in African American or Puerto Rican communities. [Women in the US are granted the right to vote in 1920]
1923: In the US v. Bhagat Singh Thind decision, the US Supreme Court found that Asian Indians are ineligible for US citizenship because they are not white. [In 1924, US Pres. Calvin Coolidge signs the Snyder Act giving Native Americans US citizenship, but many states still denied them the right to vote until 1948.]
1946:

The Luce-Celler Act grants right of naturalization and small immigration quotas to Asian Indians and Filipinos, including a national quota of 100 per year for immigrants from India. [World War II lasts from 1939 to 1945.]
1957: Dalip Singh Saund, an Indian American from Imperial Valley, California, is elected to the US House of Representatives and serves from 1957 to 1963. South Asian Americans number more than 12,000. [In 1955, the Montgomery Bus Boycott starts in Alabama. In 1956, the Supreme Court declares segregation on buses to be illegal.]
1965: The Immigration and Nationality Act, which removes quotas for Asian immigrants, triggers the second wave of South Asian immigration. [1965: President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the Voting Rights Act.]
1966-1977: Eighty-three percent of South Asians enter the United States under employment visas, including 20,000 scientists, 40,000 engineers, and 25,000 medical doctors. Most have been educated at great public expense in their nations of origin.
1987: In Hoboken, New Jersey, Navroze Mody is beaten to death by "Dotbusters"�a violent hate group active in the state. South Asian Americans number more than 200,000 in the United States. [1989 marks the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of the end of the Cold War.]
1990: Third wave of South Asian immigrants begins, including H1-B visa holders (many working in high tech), students, and working class families.
2000: Hamtramck, Michigan is the first jurisdiction to provide language assistance in a South Asian language��Bengali��to voters following a lawsuit by the Department of Justice.
September 11�17, 2001: Attacks against the World Trade Center and the Pentagon take place on September 11, 2001. In the week following 9/11, there are 645 reports of bias incidents aimed at persons perceived to be of Middle Eastern or South Asian descent. South Asians Balbir Singh Sodhi of Arizona,

Waqar Hasan of Texas, and Vasudev Patel of Texas are all killed in post-9/11 hate crimes. Harassment and threats make up more than two-thirds of all reported bias incidents.
September 2001�February 2002: The US government detains without charge about 1,100 individuals (many from India and Pakistan). Many are denied access to counsel and undergo secret hearings. Many are detained for months on end; others are deported with no evidence ever presented of terrorist activity.
2002: The FBI reports that after 9/11, reports of violence against Muslims rose by 1600%. Nineteen people are murdered in hate crimes prompted by the events of 9/11.
2002: The Special Registration (NSEERS) program requires men and boys��ages 16 and older�� from 25 Asian and African countries (24 of them predominantly Muslim, including Pakistan and Bangladesh), to report to their local immigration office for fingerprinting and interrogation. Over 93,000 people register throughout the country. None are ever charged with any terrorist related activity. More than 13,000 people were placed in deportation proceedings, while thousands more voluntarily leave the country.
2005: Piyush Bobby Jindal becomes the second South Asian American member of Congress. Many South Asians are elected to state office. [In 2007, Jindal becomes the first ever South Asian American state governor (Louisiana). Nikki Haley becomes the second in 2011 (South Carolina). Haley later becomes the US Ambassador to the United Nations under Donald Trump (2016)]
2012: Wade Michael Page, a white supremacist, walks in and opened fire during services at a Sikh gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, killing six and wounding four. Page subsequently commits suicide after police arrived on the scene. The shooting is labeled an act of "domestic terrorism."
2012/2013:

According to the 2010 US Census, there are 4.3 million people of South Asian descent in the United States. In 2012, Ami Bera from California becomes the third Indian American to be elected to the US House of Representatives.
2015: The assault of Sureshbhai Patel occurred on February 6, 2015. Patel, a 57-year-old Indian national who was visiting his son in Madison, Alabama, US, was seriously injured after being detained by three police officers in a residential neighborhood responding to a call from a neighbor that there was a "skinny black man" walking around the predominately white neighborhood. There is video footage of the officer slamming Patel to the ground. He had to be hospitalized and is partially paralyzed as a result of the injuries. The police officer (Eric Parker) was at first fired due to international uproar, but then reinstated in 2016, and was later acquitted of all charges.
2016�2019: After the November 2016 election of Donald Trump, hate crimes have skyrocketed across the US. Islamophobia and xenophobia targeting anyone with brown-skin have resulted in many deaths and injuries. In February 2017, two men originally from India chatted after work at a bar in Kansas. Asking them about their legal status and yelling at them to "get out of my country," Adam Purinton opened fire, killing Srinivas Kuchibhotla and wounding his friend Alok Madasani as well as Ian Grillot who was at the bar and tried to help the men who were being attacked.

Sample Lesson 34: Building Empathy
Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies

Time: 60 minutes Essential Questions
� What turns xenophobia into violence? Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� understand the Oak Creek tragedy in historical context; and � build empathy. Materials Needed: 1. Handout 1: BBC Article 2. Handout 2: Graphic Organizer (optional) 3. Handout 3: Oak Creek Testimony 4. Projector or smart board for YouTube viewing Performance tasks Understanding and Situating the Oak Creek Tragedy Activity (3 min) 1. Connect students to the activity from the previous Lesson where they represented their own migration story and the xenophobia their families may have faced and also to the South Asians in America timeline that they walked through for the previous Lesson. Part I: Opening Activity (15 min) Before beginning the lesson, the teacher should warn students that this lesson contains details and stories from a recent mass shooting. Direction for Students: 1. Today, we will examine the treatment of South Asians and Muslims in America. We will begin class by reading and reacting to a current event. In the fall of 2012, a white

supremacist opened fire in a Sikh temple, known as a Gurdwara, and killed seven innocent people. As you read this article, pay attention to what happened and why it happened. Use the headings to take note of the key ideas the author wants to illustrate, and also pay attention to how you are feeling. Annotate the article as you read for key ideas and your reactions. Draw on information you learned in the previous two lessons as you respond to the text.
Instructions for Facilitator/Teacher:
1. Give students 7�10 minutes to read and react to the article and follow with a facilitated discussion. After reading the article, the teacher should provide time for comment and reflection to help the student process the traumatic events.
� Handout 1: BBC News Article
� Handout 2: Graphic Organizer (optional)
2. Guiding Questions for Discussion: What are your reactions to this article? What do you see happening here? Why do you think this happened? How do you see xenophobia and racism at play?
Part II: Historicize Oak Creek � 9/11 Connections (15 minutes)
1. If a student doesn't mention this, highlight that a key idea the article mentions is that this is not the first of these kinds of incidents. Ten years ago, after the World Trade Center attack on 9/11, Muslims and Sikhs became targets of xenophobic harassment and attack.
2. Guiding Questions:
� What do you know about 9/11?
� What knowledge do you have of what happened to members of the South Asian and Muslim communities after 9/11?
� Why do you think this happened?

3. Use a T-chart/graphic organizer to capture student responses.
� Key Understanding:
o After 9/11, South Asians and Muslims have experienced increased incidents of racial profiling, harassment, discrimination, bullying, and hate crimes.
4. Have students watch the opening sequence of the documentary Divided We Fall (0� 4:30) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d22ZuUbgZeg. Frame the viewing by telling students that you will now watch a segment of a film that captures the aftermath of 9/11 faced by South Asians, Muslims, and Arab Americans. Tell students to record their reactions.
5. Discussion: What are your thoughts regarding the connections between the Oak Creek tragedy and post-9/11 aftermath?
Part III. Building Empathy: Oak Creek Testimony and Response Letter (25 min)
1. Bring students back to the Oak Creek tragedy by suggesting that hearing people's testimonies and narratives deepens our understandings. Tell students that you will now read a testimony from the Oak Creek tragedy.
2. Engage in a shared reading of the Oak Creek testimony (Teacher reads aloud, students follow along).
� Handout 3: Oak Creek Testimony
3. Ask students to reread the Oak Creek testimony independently, and respond by writing a letter to Harpreet. As they read the Oak Creek testimony again, guide them to capture their emotional reactions, and think about what they would like to share with teenagers who share Harpreet's religious background.
4. Before the end of the class period, ask if any student would like to share any excerpts from their letter. Ask students: How did it feel to write the letter?

US and Canada 6 August 2012 Last updated at 09:21 ET https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-19143281 Sikhs express shock after shootings at Wisconsin temple Sikhs living in the United States have expressed their shock and fear after a shooting at a temple in Wisconsin on Sunday which left seven people dead. Some community members could not believe what happened. Others said they had feared such attacks since 9/11. A gunman entered the Sikh temple on Sunday morning and opened fire, killing six people and injuring a policeman. The suspect has been named as Wade Michael Page, a 40-year-old army veteran, in US media reports. But his identity has not been independently confirmed to the BBC. A vigil for the victims was held in nearby Milwaukee as police searched the suspect's home. FBI and bomb squad officers have surrounded the property of the alleged gunman in Cudahy, about 2.5 miles (4km) north of the Wisconsin Sikh Temple, and evacuated local residents. In total, seven people died in the attack in Oak Creek, a suburb of Milwaukee, including the gunman. A police officer and two other men were critically injured.

Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who is himself a Sikh, said he was "deeply shocked and saddened" by the attack.
"That this senseless act of violence should be targeted at a place of religious worship is particularly painful," Mr Singh said in a statement.
Muslim confusion
Officials have not yet identified the gunman or a possible motive, but Sikh organisations in the US say the community has been vulnerable since the 9/11 attacks.
"This is something we have been fearing since 9/11, that this kind of incident will take place," said Rajwant Singh, chairman of the Washington-based Sikh Council on Religion and Education.
"It was a matter of time because there's so much ignorance and people confuse us [as] being members of Taliban or belonging to [Osama] bin Laden," he told Associated Press.
"We never thought this could happen to our community," Devendar Nagra, 48, told Associated Press. "We never did anything wrong to anyone."
Sikhism hails from the Indian subcontinent, and observant Sikhs wear turbans. Members of the community have been attacked in the past by assailants mistaking them for Muslims.
"That turban has tragically marked us as automatically suspect, perpetually foreign and potentially terrorists," Valarie Kaur, a filmmaker based in the US who has chronicled attacks on Sikhs, told AP.
Several hundred people turned up to an impromptu candlelit vigil in Milwaukee on Sunday evening for the victims. Cab driver and Oak Creek resident Kashif Afridi went to the temple after he heard about the attack.
"When the shooting happened, I was at home watching the news. I went straight out and drove to the temple. There were lots of police and the area was closed off.
"The press was already there and there were lots of people from the Sikh community. I spoke to one girl who was in the temple when the shooting happened.

"She said when the shooting started, everyone panicked. People were running around trying to hide. She said she lost her uncle.
"People here are in a state of a shock. This is a very small and peaceful place, you would never imagine this kind of attack could happen here. Nobody can believe it.
"Lots of people have gathered in the area. People just stop by to express their sympathies."
'Terrorist-type incident'
There are an estimated 2,500�3,000 Sikh families in and around the city worshipping at two gurdwaras, or temples, including the Wisconsin Sikh Temple.
Lakhwinder Singh, a member of the congregation there, told Reuters that two of the victims were believed to be the president of temple and a priest.
"It will take a long time to heal. We're hurt very badly," he said.
President Barack Obama expressed his condolences with victims of the attack, which comes just over two weeks after a gun massacre left 12 people dead at a Colorado cinema.
"As we mourn this loss which took place at a house of worship, we are reminded how much our country has been enriched by Sikhs, who are a part of our broader American family."
The US embassy in India said it was "deeply saddened by the senseless loss of lives and injuries" caused by the shooting.
"Our hearts, thoughts, and prayers go out to the victims and their families," a statement said.
"The United States takes very seriously the responsibility to respect and protect people of all faiths. Religious freedom and religious tolerance are fundamental pillars of US society."
Local politician Mark Honadel called the attack "craziness".
The state representative told CNN: "Unfortunately, when this type of stuff hits your area, you say to yourself, 'why?' But in today's society, I don't think there's any place that's free from idiots."
Police have described it as a "domestic terrorist-type incident". The FBI are taking over the criminal investigation.

There was believed to be only one attacker, with eyewitness reports suggesting it was a white male.

My Reactions
Testimony before the US Senate of Harpreet Singh Saini (age 18) [Survivor of the Oak Creek Shooting]
Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights and Human Rights Committee on the Judiciary on "Hate Crimes and the Threat of Domestic Extremism"
September 19, 2012 (excerpts)
My name is Harpreet Singh Saini. I am here because my mother was murdered in an act of hate 45 days ago. I am here on behalf of all the children who lost parents or grandparents during the massacre in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. A little over a month ago, I never imagined I'd be here. I never imagined that anyone outside of Oak Creek would know my name. Or my mother's name. Paramjit Kaur Saini.
As we all know, on Sunday, August 5, 2012, a white supremacist fueled by hatred walked into our local Gurdwara with a loaded gun. He killed my mother, Paramjit Kaur, while she was sitting for morning prayers. He shot and killed five more men � all of them were fathers, all had turbans like me. And now people know all our names: Sita Singh. Ranjit Singh. Prakash Singh. Suvegh Singh. Satwant Singh Kaleka.
This was not supposed to be our American story. This was not my mother's dream. My mother and father brought Kamal and me to America in 2004. I was only 10 years-old. Like many other immigrants, they wanted us to have a better life, a better education. More options. In the land of the free. In the land of diversity.
It was a Tuesday, 2 days after our mother was killed, that my brother Kamal and I ate the leftovers of the last meal she had made for us. We ate her last rotis � which are a type of South Asian flatbread. She had made the rotis from scratch the night before she died. Along with the

last bite of our food that Tuesday...came the realization that this was the last meal, made by the hands of our mother, that we will ever eat in our lifetime. My mother was a brilliant woman, a reasonable woman. Everyone knew she was smart, but she never had the chance to get a formal education.
She couldn't. As a hard-working immigrant, she had to work long hours to feed her family, to get her sons educated, and help us achieve our American dreams. This was more important to her than anything else.
Senators, my mother was our biggest fan, our biggest supporter. She was always there for us, she always had a smile on her face. But now she's gone. Because of a man who hated her because she wasn't his color? His religion? I just had my first day of college. And my mother wasn't there to send me off. She won't be there for my graduation. She won't be there on my wedding day. She won't be there to meet her grandchildren. I want to tell the gunman who took her from me: You may have been full of hate, but my mother was full of love. She was an American. And this was not our American dream.
We ache for our loved ones. We have lost so much. But I want people to know that our heads are held high. We also know that we are not alone. Tens of thousands of people sent us letters, attended vigils, and gave us their support � Oak Creek's Mayor and Police Chief, Wisconsin's Governor, the President and the First Lady. All their support also gave me the strength to come here today.
Senators, I came here today to ask the government to give my mother the dignity of being a statistic. The FBI does not track hate crimes against Sikhs. My mother and those shot that day will not even count on a federal form. We cannot solve a problem we refuse to recognize.
Senators, I also ask that the government pursue domestic terrorists with the same vigor as attackers from abroad. The man who killed my mother was on the watch lists of public interest groups. I believe the government could have tracked him long before he went on a shooting spree.
Finally, Senators, I ask that you stand up for us. As lawmakers and leaders, you have the power to shape public opinion. Your words carry weight. When others scapegoat or demean people because of who they are, use your power to say that is wrong.

So many have asked Sikhs to simply blame Muslims for attacks against our community or just say "We are not Muslim." But we won't blame anyone else. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. I also want to be a part of the solution. That's why I want to be a law enforcement officer like Lt. Brian Murphy, who saved so many lives on August 5, 2012. I want to protect other people from what happened to my mother. I want to combat hate � not just against Sikhs but against all people. Senators, I know what happened at Oak Creek was not an isolated incident. I fear it may happen again if we don't stand up and do something. I don't want anyone to suffer what we have suffered. I want to build a world where all people can live, work, and worship in America in peace. Because you see, despite everything, I still believe in the American dream. In my mother's memory, I ask that you stand up for it with me. Today. And in the days to come.

Sample Lesson 35: Xenophobic Racism Against South Asians and Muslims: Past & Present
Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Time: 60 minutes Essential Question: How can examining historical manifestations of xenophobia and racism help us understand present forms of bias-based bullying? Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):

� examine historical roots of xenophobia against South Asians and Muslims in America; and
� compare past occurrences with modern day forms of bias-based bullying.
Materials Needed:
1. Background Information handout
2. Past & Present sets
3. Graphic Organizer
Performance Tasks: Connecting the past to the present
Before beginning the lesson, the teacher should warn students that this lesson describes acts of violence that led to death. Time for process and reflection should be given to students because each of the sets can be traumatic for some students.
Activity: (5 min)
Connect students to the previous lesson in which they developed an understanding that the Oak Creek tragedy was not a new phenomenon. Rather hate crimes against South Asians and Muslims have significantly increased after the attacks on the World Trade Center. Tell students that today, they will further historicize this and understand how xenophobia is most often linked to what is happening in the political landscape.
Quick Write (5 mins)
 Ask students to recall when the earliest South Asians came to the United States. Draw upon the timeline.
 Prompts: What you think early arrivers might have experienced? What leads you to make these inferences?
Part I: Background Information (10 min)
Instructions for Facilitator/Teacher:

For the main activity for this lesson, students will be working in groups in order to compare the harassment of South Asians and Muslims in the past and present. In the next 10 minutes, you will provide students with background knowledge to set them up effectively for their independent work. As a class you can read through Handout 1 which provides a brief synopsis of each historical occurrence that students will examine. You may want to include visual media that can be accessed below:
1907 Bellingham Riots:
http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/bham_intro.htm; http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/bham_film.htm
The Persian Gulf War: http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/gulf/
Dotbusters: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1tG6mwjOtM (begin at 0:42)
Part II: Small Group Work (25 min)
Break students into three larger groups and then create sub-groups of 3�4 students. Before you break students into groups, discuss terms:
Microaggressions: contemporary form of racism��invisible, unintentional, and subtle in nature; usually outside the level of conscious awareness but which cumulatively and over time creates a uncomfortable or hostile environment for the victim
Bullying: verbal, physical, or psychological acts of intimidation where there is an imbalance of power
Harassment: systemic and/or continued unwanted actions, including threats and demands, often based upon race, sex, religion, gender, etc.
Hate crimes: acts of violence against individuals, groups, places of worship, etc., typically motivated by some form of prejudice.
Ask students to independently read their set of events (Handout 2). Thereafter, they should work together to complete the graphic organizer (Handout 3) (this could be completed using chart paper as well). Students will summarize each event and identify whether the occurrence is an example of microaggression, bullying, or hate crime. Next, they will analyze the language

used to describe South Asians and Muslims either by perpetrators or by media sources in each excerpt. Finally, they will use guiding questions to synthesize the exercise and compare and contrast the xenophobic and racist treatment of the past and present. Students should prepare a quick three-minute presentation for the class on their event set. Note: You may want to model or use guided practice for the first set to give students an example of the type of thinking they will need to do. Part III: Whole Class Share (15 min) After each group shares, debrief the comparison of the past/present and discuss why the analysis of historical forms of xenophobic/racist phenomena is significant.
� Guiding Questions: o What did you realize as you read about the Bellingham Riots, the hate crimes that occurred during the Persian Gulf War, and the Dotbusters? o Why do you think the events of the past occurred? What was happening between the United States and other countries during this time that influenced those events? o What about present day occurrences? o What was similar to the present day forms of harassment? What was different? o What can be done?
South Asians Past & Present��Background Information 1907
Bellingham Riots "Located in the northwest corner of Washington State, just shy of the Canadian border, Bellingham boomed in the early 20th century as a center of extractive industries like mining,

fishing and timber. Workers from all over the world arrived in Bellingham looking for jobs, including a sizable number from Asia.
In the early 1900s, Asian immigrants numbered in the hundreds and were a substantial presence in Bellingham, sustaining small communities with their own restaurants, pool halls and barbershops. Yet, due to sustained campaigns of racism and exclusion, little to nothing of these communities remains in the city today. By 1950, city census numbers reported a mere eight individuals of Asian ancestry.
The most visible manifestation of these campaigns was the riot of 1907. A group of South Asian migrant workers arrived in Bellingham in 1906, employed mostly in the city's lumber mills.
Immediately, white labor leaders demanded the South Asian workers be expelled from the city, claiming the newcomers took jobs away from white workers and drove down wages."

Dotbusters: Anti-Indian Hate Group in New Jersey
In the fall of 1987, an anti-Indian hate group formed in New York and New Jersey that committed their crimes in Jersey City. Hate crimes included burglary, vandalism, and assault to murder. While the violence seemed to be aimed at the Hindu community, where the wearing of the bindi is most common, it is believed that the Dotbusters actions were based on racial grounds, aimed at South Asian immigrants.
See https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/nyregion/in-jersey-city-indians-protestviolence.html
Hate Crimes During the Persian Gulf War
The Persian Gulf War against Iraq was led by the United States, backed by a UN Coalition of 34 nations, and followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. This conflict led to an eruption of hate crimes against Arabs and Muslims, and other ethnic communities perceived to be Middle Eastern in the United States.

Xenophobic Racism Against South Asians and Muslims in the United States: Past and Present
Set #1
Event #1: 1907 Description:
On September 4, 1907, 500 white working class men in Bellingham, Washington attacked South Asian millworkers and their families. Within ten days the entire South Asian population departed town.
Morning Reveille September 6, 1907, p. 4 (Editorial)
The Hindus Have Left Us.
While any good citizen must be unalterably opposed to the means employed, the result of the crusade against the Hindus cannot but cause a general and intense satisfaction. The school kids, who made up the greater portion of the mob that put the heathen out of business, should, of course, be spanked and sent to bed and the hoodlums should go to jail, but the fact that the fear instilled into the hearts of the Hindus induced them to return to the land which owes them protection [note: reference here is to Canada] is a cause for rejoicing. Two wrongs never make a right, it is true, and such riotous demonstrations are to be discouraged and prevented, but the departure of the Hindus will leave no regret.
From every standpoint it is most undesirable that these Asians should be permitted to remain in the United States. They are repulsive in appearance and disgusting in their manners. They are said to be without shame and, while no charges of immorality are brought against them, their actions and customs are so different from ours that there can never be tolerance of them. They contribute nothing to the growth and up-building of the city as the result of their labors. They work for small wages and do not put their money into circulation. They build no homes and while they numerically swell the population, it is of a class that we may well spare. ... They have been working here because of the labor shortage, but now that they have decamped their places will be filled by white men. ... There can be no two sides to such a question. The Hindu is a detriment to the town, while the white man is a distinct advantage.

Event #2: 2005 "In the fall of 2005, seventh-grader Mandeep Singh's daily routine included fighting off classmates who pulled and yanked at his jurdha (the topknot worn by Sikh men) while calling him "Bin Laden" and "meatball head." Though Mandeep and the Sikh Coalition repeatedly complained to his school's administration, nothing was done to stem the harassment for almost two years. In February 2005 students hit the seventh-grader twice on his head, leading to contusions and a severe injury that left Mandeep confined to bed rest for weeks. Unconvinced that the school could do anything to ensure their son's safety, Mandeep's parents sent him back to his native England to finish his schooling."

Set #2
Scenario #1: 1987
In 1987, a 30-year old immigrant from India who worked in a bank, Navroze Mody, was brutally beaten to death by a group of teenagers who called themselves "Dotbusters." This group was active in New Jersey, where a large South Asian immigrant community is concentrated, and they had been harassing immigrants from South Asia for months. A month before Mody's killing, Dotbusters (referring to the bindi that Hindu women wear on their foreheads for religious purposes), sent a letter to a local newspaper.
Part of their letter read:
"I'm writing about your article during July about the abuse of Indian People. Well I'm here to state the other side. I hate them; if you had to live near them you would also. We are an

organization called dot busters. We have been around for 2 years. We will go to any extreme to get Indians to move out of Jersey City. If I'm walking down the street and I see a Hindu and the setting is right, I will hit him or her. We plan some of our most extreme attacks such as breaking windows, breaking car windows, and crashing family parties. ... They are a weak race physically and mentally. We are going to continue our way. We will never be stopped."
In Jersey City, not long after Mody's death, another person of South Asian origin was assaulted by three men with baseball bats. Incidents still continue even though laws against hate crimes have been instituted in New Jersey.
Scenario #2: 2003
"On November 27, 2003 Metro West reported that an Ashland, Massachusetts teenager defaced a Hindu temple in Ashland on Halloween. Anthony Picciolo, 17, was convicted of spray-painting hate messages. Police said Piccioli spray painted 'Sand NRRRRRR beware,' and 'head,' on a rock near the Hindu temple. Police said 'head' was short for 'towel head.' On June 25, 2003 in Boston, an Indian graduate student named Saurabh Bhalerao, who was working part time as a pizza deliveryman, was the target of deplorable abuse. He was robbed, beaten, burned with cigarettes, stuffed in a trunk and stabbed twice before finally being dumped along a road. Police suspect that the attackers mistook the Hindu man for a Muslim. As they were beating him, the attackers supposedly taunted, `go back to Iraq.'"

Event #1: 1991
Suspicious Fires Probed for Ties to Gulf Tension: Crime: An arson unit studies a West Los Angeles market blaze and police label the torching of a Sherman Oaks store a likely hate crime. Owners of both businesses are of Mideast descent
"...The Los Angeles Fire Department, meanwhile, opened an arson investigation into the other blaze that seriously damaged the Elat Market on West Pico Boulevard and destroyed an

adjoining stationery store and storage area. The fire, which occurred about 11 p.m. Tuesday, caused an estimated $325,000 damage.
"Because of the situation in the Middle East, we called for an arson unit right away," said Assistant Fire Chief Ed Allen. "The market is owned by a gentleman from Iran."
"The fire had a very good start," Allen added. "There was a lot of heavy smoke when the first companies arrived. It very quickly broke through the roof. When that happens, you take a hard look at it."
Although the owner, Ray Golbari, said repeatedly he thought the fire was "just an accident," some neighbors said it was possible someone had started the fire in the mistaken belief that Golbari is of Arab, rather than Jewish, descent.
The Elat Market has signs in both Hebrew and Persian script on the front, but Golbari said the Persian script is sometimes misread as Arabic.
There have been two other suspicious fires in the Pico-Robertson district in recent weeks. One occurred Dec. 27 at an insurance agency, and another on the night of Jan. 17 at a hot dog stand.
"This is the kind of violence that we have been warning the authorities that the Arab- American community would be subjected to," said Nazih Bayda, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.

Event #2: February 2009
"As an eighth-grade student at Beckendorf Junior High School in Katy, Texas--the same town where residents infamously held pig races to protest a proposed mosque in 2006 R R Abdul Hamed initially accepted a classmate's explanation that jibes like "terrorist" and "your family blows things up," were just jokes.

But the teasing continued almost daily, and soon escalated into shoving. Abdul alerted his teachers, who separated the boys in class, but the bullying would continue in the hallways. In early February 2009, on the school's track field, Abdul shoved back. According to Abdul, the boy left but returned several minutes later and sucker punched him, knocking him out and breaking his jaw. That was how Abdul's Palestinian parents first learned about the bullying. Abdul said school officials made the boy go to anger management counseling. "For what I went through, that punishment wasn't even close," said Abdul, whose jaw was wired shut and missed several weeks of school. Abdul, now a 15-year-old sophomore at Seven Lakes High School where his attacker also goes, said he's "moved on."

Sample Lesson 36: Native American Mascots

Theme: Identity
Disciplinary Area: Native American Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1�6
Standards Alignment:
CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.11�12.1, 2, 7; WHST.11�12.1, 4
Lesson Purpose and Overview: Students will examine past and present historical portrayals of Native American iconography and culture used as mascots for major US sports teams. Students will explore and discuss how mascots can be viewed as negative or prideful. Students will have an opportunity to read and analyze various articles and sources on the topic and determine if the use of Native American mascots should be continued or banned.
Key Terms and Concepts: Stereotypes, Colonialism, Disenfranchisement, Hegemony
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. understand the historical context of Native American iconography and symbolism used in American sports and popular culture;
2. compare and contrast differing arguments around the debate on the use of Native American iconography and symbolism within American sports; and
3. analyze why some sports teams have opted to change their mascots and/or nicknames from Native American figures, and why others have not. Students will document potential social, economic, legislative, and historic factors that have contributed to these decisions.
Essential Questions:
1. How have Native Americans in the US historically been portrayed by non-indigenous peoples?
2. How has the use of Native American iconography, imagery, and culture by nonindigenous peoples impacted Native Americans today?
3. Should sports teams continue to use these mascots? Use evidence from the texts and documents you have analyzed to support your claim.

Lesson Steps:
Day 1
1. Show internet search engine public images of American Indians. How might these images portray public opinion of American Indians?
2. Introduce the lesson by writing the following on the board: "Why are Native American mascots considered offensive by some but considered prideful to others?" Have students respond to this question on a sheet of paper. After completing their written responses, have each student share their work with a neighbor. After allowing about three to five minutes for the pairs to share, have a whole class discussion responding to the question.
3. Ask two students to come to the board and list sports teams that use Native American imagery, iconography, or cultural traits as part of their mascots, team names, or nicknames. Below is a sample list just in case students struggle to identify some teams: 1. Atlanta Braves 2. Kansas City Chiefs 3. The former Washington Redskins 4. Florida State Seminoles 5. Chicago Blackhawks 6. Cleveland Indians 7. San Diego State Aztecs
4. After drafting the list, project some images of the mascots, logos, etc. on the other side of the board. Feel free to use some of the images provided above. Again, ask students if they find the images to be disrespectful.
5. Ask students if they are aware of the Washington Redskins name change. Ask students to share what they have heard about the decision to rename the team, including the reasons for the change, how people responded to the change, and what events preceded and coincided with the decision (for example, BLM, the decision to remove Confederate statues, the decision to remove statues of Christopher Columbus and the push to rename the city of Columbus, Ohio, as well as other relevant events). If time permits, a news clip, article, or headlines can be shown to students.
6. After projecting the images, show the following video clips of the Florida State Seminoles pre-game ceremony performed by Chief Osceola Renegade, as well as a clip of the

Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Braves Tomahawk chop. Ask that student take notes on the videos and reflect on the earlier questions.
a. Florida State Seminoles: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J20wsKNV0NI
b. Kansas City Chiefs Tomahawk chop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4P6z_DTHf8
c. Atlanta Braves Tomahawk chop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bN7f4AlaGM
7. Hand out a copy of the NPR article "Are You Ready for Some Controversy?" and have students read it in class. Ask students to also respond to the following questions: 1. What do those who refuse to say the name "Redskin" call the team? 2. What media outlets have protested the use of the name Redskins? 3. When was the term "Redskin" first recorded, and whom was it used by? Why was it used? 4. How did Earl Edmonds' book, "Redskins Rime" portray Native Americans and the name Redskin? 5. What did the Washington Redskins owner say about the possibility of changing the name?
8. Provide students with two additional NPR articles "After Mounting Pressure, Washington's NFL Franchise Drops Its Team Name" and "Washington NFL Team's Sponsor FedEx Formally Asks For Team Name Change," and have students respond to the following questions. If there is not enough time in class, this can be assigned for homework. 1. How long after the first article was the second article written? The third article? 2. What events took place during that time? What prompted the decision to change the name? How have attitudes about the name changed over time?
Day 2

1. Start the second day of the lesson by asking students to pull out their homework. Ask the student to discuss their answers with a neighbor. After about five minutes of discussion be sure to collect the homework assignment.
2. First play commercial "Proud to Be"- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR-tbOxlhvE. Next, play "Redskins is a Powerful Name"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40SFqadRTQ0
3. Ask students to identify the differences between these two videos. Discuss in pairs and later as a whole class. Also ask students, "Is there a difference between what Chief Osceola Renegade does at the beginning of Florida State University's games versus what occurs at the Kansas City Chiefs and Atlanta Braves games?
4. If time permits, have student research the Florida State University's relationship with the Seminole tribe. This can also be assigned as homework. As a starting point, have students review the website listed below: 1. Seminole Tribe of Florida Website- https://www.semtribe.com/stof 2. "Relationship with the Seminole Tribe of Florida"https://unicomm.fsu.edu/messages/relationship-seminole-tribe-florida/ 3. National Congress of Indian Americans. "Anti-Defamation & Mascots"http://www.ncai.org/policy-issues/community-and-culture/anti-defamationmascots
Day 3
1. Start the day by having students report back what they learned from the homework assignment to the whole class.
2. Show images of mascots from Indian Schools like Haskell University and Sherman Indian High School. Students are asked to use the information given in Day 2 to analyze and write in letter form why these mascots are acceptable or not acceptable.
3. Ask students if there are any sports teams that have removed/retired Native American mascots or names. If students are unable to respond to the question, emphasize that the following teams and/or institutions have removed or retired the use Native American imagery from their sports teams marketing: Stanford University, the University of Illinois, the Golden State Warriors, the University of Oklahoma, Marquette University, Marquette University, Dartmouth College, Syracuse University, Coachella Valley High School, and

Fremont High School in Sunnyvale. Provide some images of the retired mascots for additional reference. Two examples are included below. 4. Show an excerpt of the film "In Whose Honor"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lUF95ThI7s 5. After watching the film, have students complete the handout provided below. 6. After completing the handout, have students share their answers with each other in pairs. 7. Students will go beyond sports to evaluate the use of other American Indian images in popular culture. Show images of products that use native American imagery, and Halloween costumes. Students write an essay providing their critical analysis of the use of these images.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework and the California Arts Education Framework:
The History�Social Science Framework (chapter 20) and the California Arts Framework (chapter 7) both include a discussion of culturally responsive teaching/pedagogy. These sections could add insight to this lesson, which is about how cultural symbols can be appropriated by an outside culture without regard for the potential impact upon those affected by that appropriation.
Possible discussion questions that you can use to explore this topic include:
� How has your culture been portrayed in the US media? How is that similar or different to the portrayal of Native Americans?
� How has the use of your culture's iconography, imagery, and culture impacted your community/culture?
� How can we combat the perpetuation of stereotypes and cultural appropriation in today's media?
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will conduct research on the history of Native American iconography, culture, and imagery being used in the marketing of US sports teams.

 Students will engage in class dialogue and debate around Native American tribes using or allowing use of their tribe as a mascot. This can take the form of a Socratic seminar where the teacher asks open-ended questions and invites students to react to their peers' responses. Students should be given questions and relevant resources ahead of time to allow them to prepare relevant notes to support the discussion. The teacher should reiterate that the focus of the discussion should be the discussion of ideas and evidence. This can also be done using philosophical chairs or a fishbowl discussion to allow students to work in pairs or groups.
 Students will have several opportunities to reflect on the differing positions of Native American tribes related to this topic.
 Students will analyze and evaluate the impact of Native American imagery beyond sports in a five paragraph essay on social, economic, legislative, and historic factors.

Sample Lesson 37: This is Indian Land: The Purpose, Politics, and Practice of Land Acknowledgment
Theme: Identity
Disciplinary Areas: Native American Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 3, 5
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 3; Historical Interpretation 4.
Lesson Purpose and Overview:
Students will be introduced to the purpose, politics, and practice of indigenous land acknowledgement in order to: show respect for indigenous peoples and recognize their enduring relationship to the land, raise awareness about histories that are often suppressed or forgotten, recognize that colonization is an ongoing process, and to inspire critically conscious action and reflection. Students will be introduced to the concept of settler colonialism, and identify counter hegemonic truth telling and reconciliation efforts.
Key Terms and Concepts: hegemony, counter-hegemony, indigenous, land acknowledgement, pre-contact, settler colonialism, genocide, master narrative, counter-narrative.
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. recognize Indigenous people's enduring relationship to the land; 2. analyze histories that are often suppressed or forgotten, and critique ongoing systems of
colonization; 3. collaborate to create, deliver, and propose their own First Nations land
acknowledgement statement as part of a broader historical truth telling campaign; and 4. understand the environmental issues that affect the Native American traditions and the
fragility of Mother Earth.

Essential Questions:
1. What makes someone a guest? Do you consider people in your community to be
guests? Why or why not?[21]
2. What does "guests" mean to Native and non-Native communities? 3. What are the Indigenous protocols involved in being a "guest," and what are our
responsibilities towards our host, Mother Earth? To what extent are our events, actions benefiting our host, Mother Earth?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
1. Start the lesson by asking the class the following questions and having students respond to them in small groups. After each group has responded to the questions, have one point person share their group's discussion with the larger class. 1. When guests come to your home or neighborhood, what, if anything is expected to them? As a host, how do you communicate hospitality? 2. When you are a guest in someone's house or neighborhood, how might you show respect?
2. Next, have each student write a written response to the following quotes/prompts: 1. "When the blood in your veins returns to the sea, and the earth in your bones returns to the ground, perhaps then you will remember that the land does not belong to YOU, it is YOU that belong to the land." -Chief Seattle 2. "We all need relationships. I don't believe in fake relationships, instead I try to establish genuine relationships everywhere I go. As a guest/visitor, you do that by being respectful and then this will be reciprocated...because in the end, we're only from one place." -Nipsey Hussle
3. After providing students with 10�15 minutes to respond to the aforementioned quotes, ask students to share their writing and thoughts with the larger class. Below are some key takeaways that should be emphasized as the teacher facilitates this discussion: 1. Indigenous peoples have had, and continue to have, an enduring relationship to Mother Earth. 2. We should strive for a genuine and respectful relationships wherever we go.
4. After discussing the quotes above, have students reflect on one of the lesson's essential question:

1. What are the Indigenous protocols involved in being a "guest" and what are our responsibilities towards our host Mother Earth?
5. After splitting the class into two groups, have the first group read an excerpt from An Indigenous People's History of the United States (http://www.beacon.org/An-IndigenousPeoples-History-of-the-United-States-P1164.aspx, click on "Excerpt"). Meanwhile, have the second group read the introduction from A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror (excerpted below). Ask each group to have a discussion addressing the following prompts and questions after they have finished reading their assigned text: 1. What are the main arguments? What does the author assume? Do you agree or disagree? 2. In mixed pairs (one person from each group), compare and contrast the two authors' perspectives on how the nation was built and why this matters. 3. In those same pairs, discuss which perspective you would identify as the master narrative and why? Which perspective might be the counter narrative?
6. Create four stations around the room that have copies of the articles and handouts listed below. Allow students to spend at least five minutes at each station to review the provided handouts. 1. Station 1: Purpose of Land Acknowledgement: Indigenous Land Acknowledgement, Explained (https://www.teenvogue.com/story/indigenousland-acknowledgement-explained) 2. Station 2: Politics of Land Acknowledgement: Native Artists Speak: This is [fill in] Land Artistic Posters (https://usdac.us/nativeland) 3. Station 3: Practice of Land Acknowledgement: TDSB schools now pay daily tribute to Indigenous lands they're built on (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/tdsb-indigenous-land-1.3773050) 4. After reading and sharing thoughts about the enduring relationship to Mother Earth, students will explore different tribal creation stories that demonstrate the importance of the environment and the Native American people. Students are given Chapter 2 Naming, pp. 28�29 (California Through Native Eyes; Reclaiming History, William J. Bauer Jr.), to read before researching a creation story from different local or regional tribes to review the relationship of the people and the land.

7. After each student has visited all three stations, have students reflect on the following in pairs: 1. What are First Nations land acknowledgements and why are they done? 2. Should our school begin assembly announcements with a land acknowledgement? If so, what might this announcement sound like, and would it be part of a broader historical truth telling campaign?
8. While still in pairs, have students work together to create their own land acknowledgement statement and poster. Start this activity by having each pair identify an area in the state that they would like to learn more about, specifically around the indigenous people from that area. Have each pair visit https://native-land.ca/ to research which tribes inhabit the area that they've identified, as well as any traditions, customs, languages, practices, etc.
9. After each pair has finished conducting research on the area of their choosing, they should begin to draft language to formulate a land acknowledgement statement. Express that there is no exact template or script, so they will need to incorporate their research and draw from examples. Be sure to provide students with an example of your own or the one below: 1. At minimum, a land acknowledgement should include the following: "We acknowledge that we are on the traditional land of the ... People." Beginning with just this simple sentence would be a meaningful intervention in most US gathering spaces. However, this statement could also include a recognition of sacred sites, elders, the local environment, history specific to the tribe, among other topics, to make the statement more tailored and robust. Below are other examples:
1. Often, statements specifically honor elders:
"I would like to acknowledge that this meeting is being held on the traditional lands of the ... People, and pay my respect to elders both past and present."
2. Some allude to the caring, reciprocal relationship with land:
"I want to respectfully acknowledge the ... People, who have stewarded this land throughout the generations."

3. Acknowledgments may also make explicit mention of the occupied nature of the territory in which a gathering is taking place:
"We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the occupied/unceded/seized territory of the ... People."
"I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are in ..., the ancestral and unceded territory of the ... People.
10. After each pair has come up with their land acknowledgement statement and written it out on a poster board (this can also be decorated), have them share their statement with the class. Teachers should also consider hosting a larger event where other students, faculty, parents, and community members can hear the students present their school land acknowledgement statements for possible adoption by school community.
11. To close out the lesson, reiterate the following: 1. Acknowledgment should be approached not as a set of obligatory words to rush through. These words should be offered with respect, grounded in authentic reflection, presence, and awareness. 2. Statements of acknowledgment do not have to be confined to spoken words. 3. Any space presents an opportunity to surface buried truths and priming our collective culture for deeper truth and reconciliation efforts.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will conduct research on different Native American tribes and draft a land acknowledgement statement and corresponding poster.

Excerpt from the Introduction of A Patriot's History of the United States: From Columbus's Great Discovery to the War on Terror by Larry Schweikart and Michael Allen (New York: Penguin Group, 2004)
Is America's past a tale of racism, sexism, and bigotry? Is it the story of the conquest and rape of a continent? Is US history the story of white slave owners who perverted the electoral process for their own interests? Did America start with Columbus's killing all the Indians, leap to Jim Crow laws and Rockefeller crushing the workers, then finally save itself with Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal? The answers, of course, are no, no, no, and NO.
One might never know this, however, by looking at almost any mainstream US history textbook. Having taught American history in one form or another for close to sixty years between us, we are aware that, unfortunately, many students are berated with tales of the Founders as selfinterested politicians and slaveholders, of the icons of American industry as robber-baron oppressors, and of every American foreign policy initiative as imperialistic and insensitive. At least Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States honestly represents its Marxist biases in the title!

What is most amazing and refreshing is that the past usually speaks for itself. The evidence is there for telling the great story of the American past honestly--with flaws, absolutely; with shortcomings, most definitely. But we think that an honest evaluation of the history of the United States must begin and end with the recognition that, compared to any other nation, America's past is a bright and shining light. America was, and is, the city on the hill, the fountain of hope, the beacon of liberty. We utterly reject "My country right or wrong"--what scholar wouldn't? But in the last thirty years, academics have taken an equally destructive approach: "My country, always wrong!" We reject that too.
Instead, we remain convinced that if the story of America's past is told fairly, the result cannot be anything but a deepened patriotism, a sense of awe at the obstacles overcome, the passion invested, the blood and tears spilled, and the nation that was built. An honest review of America's past would note, among other observations, that the same Founders who owned slaves instituted numerous ways--political and intellectual--to ensure that slavery could not survive; that the concern over not just property rights, but all rights, so infused American life that laws often followed the practices of the common folk, rather than dictated to them; that even when the United States used her military power for dubious reasons, the ultimate result was to liberate people and bring a higher standard of living than before; that time and again America's leaders have willingly shared power with those who had none, whether they were citizens of territories, former slaves, or disenfranchised women. And we could go on.
The reason so many academics miss the real history of America is that they assume that ideas don't matter and that there is no such thing as virtue. They could not be more wrong. When John D. Rockefeller said, "The common man must have kerosene and he must have it cheap," Rockefeller was already a wealthy man with no more to gain. When Grover Cleveland vetoed an insignificant seed corn bill, he knew it would hurt him politically, and that he would only win condemnation from the press and the people--but the Constitution did not permit it, and he refused.
Consider the scene more than two hundred years ago when President John Adams--just voted out of office by the hated Republicans of Thomas Jefferson--mounted a carriage and left Washington even before the inauguration. There was no armed struggle. Not a musket ball was fired, nor a political opponent hanged. No Federalists marched with guns or knives in the streets. There was no guillotine. And just four years before that, in 1796, Adams had taken part in an equally momentous event when he won a razor-thin close election over Jefferson and,

because of Senate rules, had to count his own contested ballots. When he came to the contested Georgia ballot, the great Massachusetts revolutionary, the "Duke of Braintree," stopped counting. He sat down for a moment to allow Jefferson or his associates to make a challenge, and when he did not, Adams finished the tally, becoming president. Jefferson told confidants that he thought the ballots were indeed in dispute, but he would not wreck the country over a few pieces of paper. As Adams took the oath of office, he thought he heard Washington say, "I am fairly out and you are fairly in! See which of us will be the happiest!"1 So much for protecting his own interests! Washington stepped down freely and enthusiastically, not at bayonet point. He walked away from power, as nearly each and every American president has done since.
These giants knew that their actions of character mattered far more to the nation they were creating than mere temporary political positions. The ideas they fought for together in 1776 and debated in 1787 were paramount. And that is what American history is truly about--ideas. Ideas such as "All men are created equal"; the United States is the "last, best hope" of earth; and America "is great, because it is good."
Honor counted to founding patriots like Adams, Jefferson, Washington, and then later, Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt. Character counted. Property was also important; no denying that, because with property came liberty. But virtue came first. Even J. P. Morgan, the epitome of the so-called robber baron, insisted that "the first thing is character...before money or anything else. Money cannot buy it."
It is not surprising, then, that so many left-wing historians miss the boat (and miss it, and miss it, and miss it to the point where they need a ferry schedule). They fail to understand what every colonial settler and every western pioneer understood: character was tied to liberty, and liberty to property. All three were needed for success, but character was the prerequisite because it put the law behind property agreements, and it set responsibility right next to liberty. And the surest way to ensure the presence of good character was to keep God at the center of one's life, community, and ultimately, nation. "Separation of church and state" meant freedom to worship, not freedom from worship. It went back to that link between liberty and responsibility, and no one could be taken seriously who was not responsible to God. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty." They believed those words.

As colonies became independent and as the nation grew, these ideas permeated the fabric of the founding documents. Despite pits of corruption that have pockmarked federal and state politics--some of them quite deep--and despite abuses of civil rights that were shocking, to say the least, the concept was deeply imbedded that only a virtuous nation could achieve the lofty goals set by the Founders. Over the long haul, the Republic required virtuous leaders to prosper.
Yet virtue and character alone were not enough. It took competence, skill, and talent to build a nation. That's where property came in: with secure property rights, people from all over the globe flocked to America's shores. With secure property rights, anyone could become successful, from an immigrant Jew like Lionel Cohen and his famous Lionel toy trains to an Austrian bodybuilder-turned-millionaire actor and governor like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Carnegie arrived penniless; Ford's company went broke; and Lee Iacocca had to eat crow on national TV for his company's mistakes. Secure property rights not only made it possible for them all to succeed but, more important, established a climate of competition that rewarded skill, talent, and risk taking.
Political skill was essential too. From 1850 to 1860 the United States was nearly rent in half by inept leaders, whereas an integrity vacuum nearly destroyed American foreign policy and shattered the economy in the decades of the 1960s and early 1970s. Moral, even pious, men have taken the nation to the brink of collapse because they lacked skill, and some of the most skilled politicians in the world--Henry Clay, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton--left legacies of frustration and corruption because their abilities were never wedded to character.
Throughout much of the twentieth century, there was a subtle and, at times, obvious campaign to separate virtue from talent, to divide character from success. The latest in this line of attack is the emphasis on diversity--that somehow merely having different skin shades or national origins makes America special. But it was not the color of the skin of people who came here that made them special, it was the content of their character. America remains a beacon of liberty, not merely because its institutions have generally remained strong, its citizens free, and its attitudes tolerant, but because it, among most of the developed world, still cries out as a nation, "Character counts." Personal liberties in America are genuine because of the character of honest judges and attorneys who, for the most part, still make up the judiciary, and because of the personal integrity of large numbers of local, state, and national lawmakers.

No society is free from corruption. The difference is that in America, corruption is viewed as the exception, not the rule. And when light is shown on it, corruption is viciously attacked. Freedom still attracts people to the fountain of hope that is America, but freedom alone is not enough. Without responsibility and virtue, freedom becomes a soggy anarchy, an incomplete licentiousness. This is what has made Americans different: their fusion of freedom and integrity endows Americans with their sense of right, often when no other nation in the world shares their perception.
Sample Lesson 38: Develop or Preserve? The Shellmound Sacred Site Struggle
Theme: Social Movements and Equity Disciplinary Area: Native American Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 2, 3 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 4; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 1, 2, 4; Historical Interpretation 1, 5. CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 4, 6, 9; WHST. 9�10.1, 4, 5, 6, 7 CA ELD Standards: ELD PI.9�10. 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 11 Lesson Purpose and Overview: This lesson exposes students to a highly contentious and ongoing debate around Native American sacred sites. Students will be introduced to the history of the Ohlone people, the significance of shellmounds and ongoing protests that have been organized to protect sacred sites. Students will engage sources that both support the preservation of these sites and those that are in favor of development. Finally, students will develop a persuasive essay where they

are able to offer their own opinion on the issue supported by primary and secondary source research.
Key Terms and Concepts: marginalization, sacred sites, shellmounds, preservation, repatriation
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. learn about the significance of shellmounds and sacred sites for Native Americans, specifically for the Ohlone people; and
2. analyze how redevelopment and gentrification further settler colonial practices and violate the sovereignty of indigenous lands and sacred sites.
Essential Questions:
1. Should indigenous lands and sacred sites be saved and protected? If so, what are the challenges in doing so?
2. Who should determine what happens to indigenous lands and sacred sites?
3. What should be done to reclaim and restore sacred lands?
4. What laws protect modern cemeteries and why aren't ancient cemeteries given the same protections? What happens to the burials?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
*Lesson Note: This lesson focuses on the San Francisco Bay Area, but can be adapted to highlight a number of sacred sites that are currently or have been a space of contention. For example, a similar lesson on the Puvungna burial site located at California State University, Long Beach or the Standing Rock Movement, would also introduce students to contemporary debates and struggles regarding the use of sacred lands.
Day 1
1. Begin with a community building activity (5�10 minutes). A sample list of community building activities is provided in the appendix.
2. Engage the class by asking how many students have shopped or visited the movie theater at the Emeryville Bay Street Mall. While students briefly discuss their

experiences at Bay Street Mall, project a current image of the mall next to a 1924 image of the Emeryville Shellmound. 3. Explain to the students that the second image depicts what parts of Berkeley and Emeryville looked like prior to development, specifically noting that the Bay Street Mall was constructed atop of one of the largest shellmound sites in the area. Mention that shellmounds often served as burial grounds and sacred sites where Ohlone people would meet for rituals and traditions thousands of years before the formation of the United States. Point out that there was once over 400 shellmounds all around the San Francisco Bay Area, making the region part of the Ohlone people's sacred geography. 4. As a class, read aloud a local news article, "Emeryville: Filmmaker tells story of forgotten Indian burial ground disrupted by quest for retail." After reading the article, screen two short videos, "A New Vision for the West Berkeley Shellmound" and "The Shellmound: Berkeley's Native Monument." Prior to screening the videos, remind students to be attentive and take notes. 5. After screening the videos, ask students to define the following terms in their own words: shellmound, monument, sacred geography, burial grounds, development, and repatriation, using context clues from the sources they recently read and watched. After taking five minutes to define the terms on their own, have students talk through each term aloud.
Day 2
1. After reviewing the previous day's discussion, divide the class into four groups and ask them to respond to the following questions: 1. What is the significance of shellmounds and land in the Berkeley/Emeryville area to the Ohlone people? 2. Why are the West Berkeley and Bay Street sites highly sought after by nonNative American groups? 3. How does the struggle for shellmounds intersect with environmental issues in the region? 4. Do you think places where shellmounds are or once stood should be preserved? 5. Are there any sacred or historical sites that members in your community and/or family revere? If so, please share with the group.

2. After allowing the groups to discuss the five reflection questions for fifteen to twenty minutes, provide a few minutes for the class to come together and debrief what was discussed in groups.
Day 3
1. Continue the third day of class by introducing a new assignment. Have students conduct research on both sides (the position of the Ohlone people and those in support of further developing the area) of the Berkeley/Emeryville Shellmound struggle and write a persuasive essay in response to the essential question based on the evidence they have gathered, class discussions, and their own observations and insights. The persuasive essay should be assigned as homework; however, students should be provided ample time in class over the next three days to conduct research, draft an outline and thesis statement, and have their work peer reviewed.
2. For additional guidance, collaborate with an English language arts teacher to create a grading rubric for the persuasive essay (or ask to use an existing rubric), compile a brief list of recommended sources, and let students know that their essays must include the following: 1. Your persuasive essay must be five paragraphs (introduction, three body paragraphs, and a conclusion), be typed in 12 point Times New Roman font, and include a bibliography listing at least four sources (scholarly and credible) in MLA format. 2. Your persuasive essay must have a well-conceived thesis statement that includes your three major talking points/arguments. 3. Each of your talking points/arguments must be supported with evidence. 4. Your essay should be well organized and include rhetorical devices.
3. After a week, students should submit their persuasive essays in class. Provide each student with a 3x5 index card where they are tasked with writing down their three talking points/arguments. After everyone has finished filling out their index card, have students form groups of 3 � 5 students. Group members should take turns sharing their talking points. When all students have shared, they should collectively decide what their three or four strongest points are, create a thesis statement based on those points, and select one group representative to share their points with the class. Group members should

help their representative write a short (two to three-minute) explanation that includes a thesis statement and their key points.
Making Connections to the History�Social Science Framework:
Chapter 16 of the framework discusses a number of civil rights movements that were created in response to political, economic, and social discrimination. Teachers can build upon the example of the struggle to preserve the shellmound sites and have students compare that to some of the other movements referenced in the framework, such as the 1969�1971 occupation of Alcatraz or the American Indian Movement's 1972�73 standoff at Wounded Knee in South Dakota. This lesson can also be connected to the Social Movements and Student Civic Engagement lesson.
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
 Students will conduct research on Native American sacred lands. They will analyze the positions of both the Ohlone people and developers in the ongoing movement around sacred sites.
 Students will write a five paragraph essay detailing the significance of these sites as well as the social, cultural, and environmental impact of development on and near sacred sites. They will also present their research findings and arguments to the class.

[6] The sociologists would say that Sammy Lee suffered from "internalized racism," the idea being that within white supremacy, non-white persons often feel worthless, and they often wish to be white, even to pass as white. We see the impact of internalized racism in public law during this period, as when Kenneth and Mamie Clark presented their "doll studies" as part of the Brown case in 1952; Kluger explains these studies in Simple Justice, in note 10, below. The idea also appears in influential pieces of literature, as in Toni Morrison, The Bluest Eyes (2007).

[21] The use of "guests" throughout this lesson draws on Native American epistemology that places high reverences on land and the environment, and considers all human beings as "guests" on Earth. However, this analogy of "guests" can also be used to discuss settler colonialism and how non-Native people are also "guests" on lands that formerly belonged to indigenous people. When using the latter analogy, it is important to recognize that some non-Native people, such as African Americans, have more complex histories of forced migration, thus, the notion of "guests" will not always adequately capture the nature of non-Native positionalities on the land.

Affirming Identity
While raising the voices and experiences of the four core groups, ethnic studies is not intended to silence other voices. Many students have experienced some type of othering, whether individually or collectively with their community. Intersectional identities heighten the possibility that different elements of one's identity will make such experiences even more likely.

Commented [2]: This section(s) should be in the Overview of the Appendix for Sample Lessons or "General" section before breaking into the respective disciplines.

You may have students in your class who do not identify with the groups at the core of the ethnic studies curriculum. The lessons here can help you provide identity-affirming moments in your class and help students connect their own identities and experiences with the themes of the course. These lessons do not replace the core curriculum, but provide avenues to enter and expand upon the themes in the core curriculum. In particular, these lessons provide the students opportunities to
 explore parallel experiences and connections between populations  look for commonalities and related strengths across groups;  identify points of contact between groups, including tension points and resolutions; and  allow all students to see their own identity affirmed such that the curriculum can move
away from a sense of competition between groups and towards compassion for each other.
As an example, the lesson "Armenian Migration Stories and Oral History" presents a window into one particular community's story of living in diaspora, while also serving as a mirror for considering migration experienced by others. The Armenian community in California grew over the course of the twentieth century as thousands of Armenians fled violence in their home country. The Hamidian massacres, the Armenian genocide during World War I, the escape from Soviet rule of Armenia, and other conflicts launched multiple waves of immigration to the United States. This serves as a reminder that even within a community that may seem similar from the outside, there can be many differences. Someone who migrated from communist Armenia may have a very different mindset than someone whose family has lived in the United States for a century. Interviewing elders in a community��in this lesson and at other points within ethnic studies��allows history to be told by those who both experienced marginalization (in their country of origin and in the United States) and acted as agents of change for their own life. Who tells history matters.
Exploring and Embracing Your Own Community
To fully support the growth and learning of all of California's students, it is necessary for schools to engage their communities in the process of building and strengthening connections across the ethnic groups they serve. An ethnic studies curriculum is just one component of this work. The entire educational program should promote this endeavor, even while the social studies

bear particular responsibility for helping students develop a deep understanding of the community's history--within the context of state, national, and world histories--and the legacy of the past. Beyond classrooms, there is an opportunity for adult learning that engages whole faculties and the community at large. This wider engagement strengthens the community restoration noted in chapter 1.
Some of the ways students can be involved in exploring their own community include:
 Oral History: The best resources for learning about a community are often the people who live there. By bringing voices from the community into the classroom, teachers can help ensure that students' identities are affirmed and the community's stories are told.
 Cultural Institutions: Cultural organizations in your community play a key role in raising up the histories and contributions of the groups who live there. They also highlight those interactions between groups that have shaped the character of the community.
 Memorials: Memorials, monuments, and murals are key markers of a community's identity and history. They offer students opportunities to analyze critically whose voices are shared and whose history is acknowledged, and to identify opportunities for giving voice to additional stories and histories within the community.
These lessons support educators in differentiating their instruction in order to reflect the diversity of Californians, and the diversity of their own classrooms. When integrating these lessons, students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to recognize their role as agents of change.
Complicating Single Stories
These lessons provide opportunities for students to reflect explicitly on unnoticed or unintended marginalization and the increase in stereotyping during times of heightened fear. As students become civic actors, they have an opportunity to challenge misperceptions which contribute to oppression for any. This begins with challenging our own misperceptions, as noted in Author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's thought-provoking TED Talk, "The Danger of a Single Story." (See related lesson: https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/standingdemocracy/transcending-single-stories)
Deborah Tannen, psychologist, has noted, "We all know we are unique individuals, but we tend to see others as representatives of groups. It's a natural tendency, since we must see the world

in patterns in order to make sense of it; we wouldn't be able to deal with the daily onslaught of people and objects if we couldn't predict a lot about them and feel that we know who and what they are. But this natural and useful ability to see patterns of similarity has unfortunate consequences. It is offensive to reduce an individual to a category, and it is also misleading." This tendency towards patterns can lead to a single narrative about groups which are not our own. Ethnic studies provides a space to challenge that single narrative and fosters the space for all members of society to define their own identities rather than be defined by others.
For example, "Arab American" can refer to individuals with roots in 22 Arab countries. These countries are located across land stretching roughly from northern Africa through western Asia, which in itself suggests a far greater range of diversity than a single experience. Contrary to popular representation, not all Muslims are Arabs, and not all Arabs��or Arab Americans��are Muslim. Many Arab countries include Christian communities, and some have also had Jewish communities. Arabs have migrated to the United States for a variety of reasons, including economic need, educational opportunity, political conflict, and even war. Like many groups in the United States, the demographics of Arab Americans has shifted over time and continues to be fluid in nature. Also like many groups, the misperceptions about Arab Americans is often exacerbated by representation in the media which focuses on single stories. The lesson "Arab American Stereotypes in Literature, Film, and Media Pre- and Post-9/11" presents resources to guide students through analyzing the portrayal of Arab Americans and recognizing how stereotypes have been challenged.
The lesson "Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race" provides another example for complicating single stories. Jewish Americans are connected through many ties, and yet each identity is a unique combination of facets. In this lesson, the single story is challenged by presenting experiences and perspectives from diverse voices who all identify with being Jewish American.
Sharing a Wide Picture of Democratic Participation
These lessons include narratives that emphasize the contributions of diverse individuals in shaping US democratic life. It is important for students to see the widest range of individual backgrounds as well as forms of engagement to recognize the contributions already made to our democracy by different groups. Sometimes we look to the national stage for representation,

but Californians can also look to local government and community leaders for examples of how individuals from many different backgrounds can and have already engaged in our democracy.
One example of this comes from the Sikh community. Sikh have lived in California for over a century and have served as civic leaders at local, state, and national levels. The first Sikh place of worship in the United States was established in Stockton, California, and California is now home to the largest Sikh population in the United States (approximately 250,000 with 74 Sikh houses of worship). The first-ever Asian and the first Indian to be elected to the United States Congress (1957�1963) was Dalip Singh Saund, who was Sikh. His civic leadership set an example and opened doors not just for the Sikh community, but for others as well. The lesson "The Sikh-American Community in California" provides more detail.
Widening Our Universe of Obligation
These lessons draw out another crucial opportunity for all students: to examine closely those moments in our history that cause increased fear in society and are often accompanied by heightened distrust of others, increased "othering" treatment, and even the violent targeting of individuals based on the identities they are perceived to hold. In many cases, these events exacerbate or make more visible historical divisions between groups. We have seen such behavior in times of war, following the September 11 terrorist attacks, and during the COVID pandemic. Such targeting leaves entire groups vulnerable, and in some cases has led to mass violence including ethnic cleansing and genocide.
Within high school classrooms, students should be expected to explore this level of exclusion and violent targeting at a number of points. These are historical periods to use in reference during ethnic studies as well, and will include:
 The Armenian Genocide during World War I  The Holocaust during World War II  The incarceration of Japanese Americans in California and across the nation during
World War II  The increased targeting of Muslims and others perceived to be different after the 9/11
terrorist attacks

The lesson "Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-American" provides one example for looking into how long-lasting division and misperceptions become exacerbated in particular moments. Antisemitism is an ancient hatred that has persisted for centuries. It is also a contemporary hatred and form of prejudice, and reported incidents of antisemitism are increasing around the world and in California. One of the things seen through history is that antisemitism has been fluid in shape��sometimes taking the form of religious targeting, at other times defined around ethnic or racial arguments. It has also been interwoven at times with white nationalism and other forms of prejudice and discrimination.
In conjunction with these lessons, teachers might consider introducing their students to the concept of "universe of obligation" to help them better understand and discuss how societies define who is protected and who is not. Sociologist Helen Fein coined this term to describe the group of individuals within a society "toward whom obligations are owed, to whom rules apply, and whose injuries call for amends." In other words, a society's universe of obligation includes those people that society believes deserve respect and whose rights it believes are worthy of protection.
A society's universe of obligation can change. History has shown that in times of fear and uncertainty--such as war, economic depression, or pandemic--a society's universe of obligation often narrows. Widely shared beliefs and attitudes about such social categories as religion, gender, and race also influence which people a society protects and which people it does not.
Although Fein conceived of "universe of obligation" to describe the way nations determine membership, we might also refer to an individual's universe of obligation to describe the circle of other individuals that a person feels a responsibility to care for and protect. Applying this concept to individuals gives us the opportunity to recognize the internalized hierarchies that influence how we think about and respond to the needs of others. While it is neither practical nor possible that one's universe of obligation could include everyone equally, acknowledging the way we think about and prioritize our obligations toward others can help us act in a more thoughtful, compassionate manner.
The "universe of obligation" concept offers a powerful lens through which students can examine both their individual beliefs and actions as well as the systems and structures in our society that indicate who belongs and who does not, and how these thoughts change over time. The

concept also lays the foundation for discussions about how students can use their own agency to help widen the circle of people who are included, respected, and protected in our society.
Seeking Models of Interethnic Bridge-building
As ethnic studies students explore social movements and equity, it is valuable to share examples of interethnic initiatives in which individuals from different groups have worked together for change. Depending on the demographics of your class, here are a few additional examples to add to those in the model curriculum:
 When the Mendez v. Westminster case challenged school segregation in California, amicus curiae briefs in support of Mendez were submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Lawyers Guild, the Japanese American Citizens League, the American Jewish Congress, and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
 When his Japanese American friends were incarcerated during World War II, Mexican American high school student Ralph Lazo entered the camps with them.
 Black Civil Rights leaders provided critical support for the Asian American civil rights movement after the killing of Vincent Chin.
 Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta are perhaps the best-known names associated with The United Farmworkers movement, but Larry Itliong and Nagi Daifullah mobilized participation from Filipino and Arab-American communities, respectively, which contributed to the impact for a common goal.
 As the genocide in Darfur became visible globally, Armenians were one of the groups particularly vocal in advocating for action.
 In 2017, as talk increased about a "Muslim ban," many Japanese Americans mobilized to actively oppose it and increase education on civil rights.
Social movements present a complicated history, with spaces of more singular advocacy living side-by-side with collaboration. These examples are not intended to replace the presence and importance of civil rights movements dedicated to single groups. However, as we move forward as a diverse state, these examples can provide models for how to work together for change that benefits all. Such interethnic collaboration towards a shared purpose is, after all, crucial to strengthening democracy in the United States.

These lessons support educators in differentiating their instruction in order to reflect the diversity of Californians, and the diversity of their own classrooms. When integrating these lessons, students from all backgrounds have the opportunity to recognize their role as agents of change.

1.

What is Sikhism?

2.

How did Sikhs immigrate to California?

3.

How did Sikhs shape Californian history?

Lesson plans/activities:

This lesson has been structured into three parts to address the three essential questions. It is expected to take 4�5 40-minute class periods but can be adapted as necessary.

1. What is Sikhism?

The first essential question has students understanding the fundamental beliefs and practices of the Sikh religion. The formative performance task asks students to list the important tenets of Sikhism using featured sources.

The featured sources for this question are two short video clips from CNN's show United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell and an informational chapter about Sikhism from the National Council for the Social Studies. Featured Source A (https://vimeo.com/353626143/c26f27df57) is a video clip (4 minutes and 40 seconds) featuring an introduction to Sikhism. Featured Source B (https://vimeo.com/353627296/95fa5d6961) is also a video clip (3 minutes and 8 seconds) on the Sikh turban. Featured Source C (https://www.sikhcoalition.org/resources/national-council-social-studies-chapter-teachingsikhism/) is a short chapter about Sikhism from the National Council for the Social Studies bulletin, Teaching About Religion in the Social Studies Classroom.

Formative Performance Task: Make a list of the important tenets of Sikhism.

2. How did Sikhs immigrate to California?
For this question, students create a graphic that shows how Sikhs immigrated to America noting the contextual factors that impacted the community using featured sources.
Featured Source A (https://vimeo.com/353627855/cfddb57f00) is another short video segment from CNN's United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell. The clip discusses farming and Sikh immigration to the United States. Featured Source B (http://www.sikhcoalition.org/wpcontent/uploads/2020/03/CA-Essential-Question-2-SourceB.pdf) is a world map of Punjab, India, illustrating the route Sikhs took to the United States. Featured Source C (https://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/punjabi-sikh-mexican-americancommunity-history.pdf) is a newspaper article from The Washington Post by Benjamin Gottlieb (2012) entitled, Punjabi Sikh-Mexican American community fading into history. Featured Source D (http://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CA-Essential-Question-2SourceD.pdf) is a speech by Bruce La Brack (2011) entitled, A Century of Sikhs in California.
Formative Performance Task: Create a graphic that shows how Sikhs immigrated to California noting the contextual factors that impacted the community.
3. How did Sikhs shape Californian history?
This question asks students to write a paragraph about one of the featured case studies focusing on how that example shaped an aspect of American history.
Featured Sources A�C are case studies on the following: Dr. Narinder Singh Kapany (https://thepositiveindian.wordpress.com/2015/04/16/dr-narinder-kapany-the-man-who-bentlight/), Dalip Singh Saund (http://www.sikhcoalition.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/CAEssential-Question-3-SourceB.pdf), and the AB1964 policy (https://hyphenmagazine.com/blog/2012/08/what-unity-looks-ab-1964) . Together, these sources focus on three unique and compelling stories of how the Sikh community has shaped American history.
Formative Performance Task: Write a paragraph about one of the case studies and how that example shaped an aspect of Californian history.
Summative performance task:

Argument
How have Sikh Americans responded to the challenges and opportunities in California? Construct an argument (e.g., detailed outline, poster, essay) that discusses this compelling question using specific claims and relevant evidence from the historical and contemporary sources.
Taking informed action
 Assessment: Examine how CNN's United Shades of America show on the Sikh community in Northern California's attempts to raise awareness about Sikhism.
 Application: Discuss how using popular media and pop culture may shape attitudes towards Sikhs.
 Action and Reflection: Determine how you might help the Sikh community with their campaign.
Lesson modifications/accommodations for students with diverse needs:

Sample Lesson 40: Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans
Theme: Identity Disciplinary Area: Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 3, 4, 6 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 1; Historical Interpretation 1, 3, 4 CCSS ELA/Literacy: W.9�10.7 10.4; CCSS ELA/Literacy: W.11�12.7; CCSS ELA/Literacy: W.11�12.8; CCSS ELA/Literacy: W.11�12.9 Lesson Purpose and Overview:

Commented [4]: This should be in AAPI section

This lesson introduces students to antisemitism and its manifestations through the lens of Jewish Middle Eastern Americans, also known as Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews, whose contemporary history is defined by recent struggles as targets of discrimination, prejudice and hate crimes in the United States and globally. Students will analyze and research narratives, primary, and secondary sources about Mizrahi Jews. The source analysis contextualizes the experience of Jewish Middle Eastern Americans within the larger framework of systems of power (economic, political, social).
Key Terms and Concepts: Mizrahi, antisemitism, indigeneity, ethnicity, prejudice, refugees, diaspora, immigration, intersectionality
Lesson Objective (Students will be able to...):
1. develop an understanding of Jewish Middle Eastern Americans (who are also referred to as Arab Jews, Mizrahi Jews, Sephardic Jews, and Persian Jews) and differentiate the various identities, nationalities, and subethnicities that make up the Jewish American community;
2. develop an understanding of contemporary antisemitism and identify how the Jewish Middle Eastern American community today is impacted by prejudice and discrimination against them, as intersectional refugees, immigrants, and racialized Jewish Americans; and
3. students will construct a visual, written, and oral summary of antisemitism in the United States using multiple written and digital texts.
Essential Questions:
 Who are Jewish Americans? Who are Jews of Middle Eastern descent?  What is antisemitism? What are the manifestations of antisemitism as experienced by
intersectional, Jewish Middle Eastern Americans?  What new possibilities can students imagine and actions can they take to address
antisemitism?
Lesson Steps/Activities
Day One: Antisemitism and Jewish Ethnic Diversity

Introduce the lesson by posting the words "Antisemitism" and "Jewish Americans" to engage students in a discussion of who Jewish Americans are and about the discrimination that they face.
1. Begin by asking students what is antisemitism and who are Jewish Americans? Write their responses on the board under the columns of Antisemitism and Jewish Americans. After responses have been written on the board list the various subethnic groups under the Jewish American column such as Ashkenazi/Eastern European, Mizrahi & Sephardic/Middle Eastern and North African, Iranian/Persian, Israeli, Ethiopian, Russian, and Latinx.
2. Tell students "that following expulsions by the Babylonians in 586 BCE and the Romans in 70 CE from the land of Israel, many indigenous Jews established new homes in the Middle East and beyond forming the Jewish diaspora. In a Jewish historical context, the term diaspora refers to Jews living outside of Israel. More broadly, the term diaspora refers to ethnic or religious populations that are dispersed from modern-day Israel. Today, Jews are a racially and ethnically diverse group that continues to face antisemitism in the United States and in countries around the world.
Tell the students that today "they are going to delve deeper into the experience of discrimination, hate, and violence against Jewish Middle Eastern Americans at present while imagining a response to it. Explain to students that since the 1940s, one-million Jewish refugees from the Middle East, who are also known as Mizrahi and Sephardic Jews, fled antisemitic persecution to countries around the world.
Today, the US has a population of an estimated 900,000 Jews who descend from Mizrahi and Sephardic Jewish refugees from the Middle East including an estimated 250,000 � 300,000 in California. Individuals in these communities have intersectional identities as a result of experiencing prejudice and discrimination as Jewish Americans, as Middle Eastern refugees and immigrants, and some as people of color."
Today and for homework, the students will explore primary and secondary sources to understand antisemitism as it is experienced by Jewish Middle Eastern Americans in the US.
3. Provide Handout A and read it together.

4. Distribute Handout B to each student in groups of six. These graphic organizers have hyperlinks for all the sources but students will need to take notes in a notebook. If computers are available, students can use them to read material and watch videos. Within groups, students can work in elbow pairs to complete one or two sources on the graphic organizer.
5. Explain the columns of the graphic organizer and provide a small amount of context for the sources (e.g., highlighting primary or secondary sources, identifying narratives, and including a review of secondary sources like credible news articles, scholarly research, interviews, statistics, informational videos, etc.).
6. Provide students with class time to work on the assignment. They should also work on the assignment as homework.
a. For individual student assessments, each student is required to hand in their graphic organizer notes in the form of an essay.
7. As follow up, teachers should facilitate a discussion about antisemitism experienced by Jewish Middle Eastern Americans utilizing the following questions: 1. How have the intersectional identities of Jewish Middle Eastern Americans resulted in multiple experiences of discrimination? How have other ethnic groups experienced similar forms of discrimination? 2. What is the effect of hateful images and speech? Do images and words reflect existing attitudes or create them? 3. How is antisemitism similar to or different from other forms of group hatred? 4. What can we do to make a difference?
Assessment, Application, Action, and Reflection:
1. Students will conduct research on antisemitism (past and present) of Mizrahi Jews in the United States through primary and secondary sources.
2. Students will write a five-paragraph essay detailing the impacts of antisemitism and linking them to past and present events. Students are encouraged to imagine new possibilities to combat antisemitism by developing potential responses to it.

HANDOUT A: Defining Antisemitism
History: Antisemitism as a form of racism
In the late 1800s, many European and American scientists continued to divide humankind into smaller and smaller "races." One of these was the "Semitic race," which they used to categorize Jews. The term antisemitism was coined by German Wilhelm Marr, who published a pamphlet in 1878 titled "The Victory of Judaism over Germandom." Filled with lies and myths about Jews, Marr's pamphlet argued that Jews were more than a distinct "race." They were dangerous and alien, intent on maliciously destroying German society.
Historian Deborah Dwork explains that, "The move from anti-Judaism--against the religion--to antisemitism with this notion of `race' was only possible when Europeans conceived of the idea of race. And once they had conceived of the idea of race in the 19th century, Wilhelm Marr had the notion that Jews constituted a `race.' And thus, antisemitism can be seen as a form of racism." https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/teaching-holocaust-and-humanbehavior/roots-and-impact-antisemitis
Modern Definitions of Antisemitism
According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), the world's leading organization committed to stopping the defamation of the Jewish people antisemitism is, "The belief or behavior hostile toward Jews just because they are Jewish. It may take the form of religious teachings that proclaim the inferiority of Jews, for instance, or political efforts to isolate, oppress, or otherwise injure them. It may also include prejudiced or stereotyped views about Jews."
According to the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA), the only intergovernmental organization mandated to focus solely on Holocaust-related issues, "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or nonJewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."

HANDOUT B: Graphic Organizer
Use the graphic organizer below to gather pertinent information from the articles. Each student is required to take notes and write a five-paragraph essay. Your essay could provide information on the historical background, factors that led to antisemitism, impact of antisemitism, and what resolutions/responses have been or could be created to combat antisemitism. Use your binders to take notes!

Sample Lesson 41: Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race
Theme: Identity
Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies
Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 2, 4, 5
Standards Alignment:
CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Chronological and Spatial Thinking 2, 4; Historical Research, Evidence, and Point of View 2, 4; Historical Interpretation 1, 2, 3

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson examines the diversity of the Jewish American community to teach students about visible and invisible parts of intersectional identities, and how this impacts Jewish Americans' identities and how Jews are perceived by others. While individual identity is personal, Jewish

Commented [5]: This should be in the general section on intersectionality

Americans are connected through ties of history, culture, language, religion, ancestry, celebrations, communal and familial traditions, common values, and a sense of a common ethnic peoplehood.
By examining how Jews have been stigmatized as outsiders, sometimes seen as a racialized other, and sometimes have experienced conditional whiteness and privilege, the lesson will address how conceptions of race and labels change over time and place (racial formation), adding another lens to the study of race. The lesson explains how the experiences of Jewish Americans include: prejudice, discrimination, antisemitism, racialization, hate crimes, Holocaust denial, and being targets of white supremacists, and how some Jews have also experienced assimilation, conditional whiteness, and privilege. Communal experiences of persecution and the Holocaust have led to a widespread commitment among Jews to pursue justice and repair the world for all people, and a vigilance against rising antisemitism. Jews are a distinct ethnic group connected by rich traditions, thousands of years of history, ancestry, language, and religion.
Key Terms and Concepts: antisemitism, conditional whiteness, identity, intersectionality, racial formation, racialization, Jews of color, Mizrachi, Sephardi, Ashkenazi
Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. explain how identities are composed of visible and invisible attributes, and are intersectional and multifaceted;
2. learn about diversity within the Jewish American ethnic community;
3. understand the varied intersectional identities of Jewish Americans and how Jews see themselves; and
4. identify the range of Jewish American experiences in relation to race and racial hierarchies over time, and how Jews are seen by others.
Essential Questions:
1. How do visible and invisible components make up each person's unique identity?
2. How does the concept of intersectionality help us understand Jewish American experiences?

3. How do conceptions of race change over time and place? What is racialization?
4. How does the diversity of Jewish Americans deepen our understanding of the concepts of race and ethnicity?
Lesson Steps/Activities
Diversity of Jewish Americans: Identity and Intersectionality
1. Iceberg of Identity Activity for Students - Only a small part of an iceberg is visible above the waterline, while most of the iceberg's mass lies below the waterline and is invisible. Share an image of an iceberg, or a blank copy of the iceberg of identity worksheet. Tell students that some parts of identity are visible to others, while other parts of identity are invisible to others.
Distribute two blank copies of the Iceberg of Identity worksheet handout.
Using one blank copy of the Iceberg of Identity worksheet, ask students to write in categories of identity that are:
� usually visible to others above the water line, in the top third.
� sometimes visible, and sometimes invisible close to the waterline.
� usually invisible to others in the bottom third of the iceberg.
Teachers may give the option to add examples of these categories, either about a hypothetical student or about themselves. Emphasize this is optional, and there is no need to disclose private information unless they are comfortable sharing.
Refer students to the Iceberg of Identity Categories list below. Suggest they add at least three visible and three invisible examples from these categories to the first Iceberg of Identity worksheet:

Fact Sheet on Jewish American Diversity
 Jewish Americans have come to the United States from all over the world.

 The Jewish people originated about 3,000 years ago in Southwest Asia, in the land of Israel.
 Jews do not fit neatly into predefined categories and meet the criteria for being both a religious group and an ethnic group.
 Jews are a distinct ethnic group connected by rich traditions, thousands of years of history, ancestry, language, and religion. Jewish American ethnic identity may be expressed through food, language, holidays, celebrations, expressions of peoplehood, remembrances of historical and ancestral experiences, connections to the land of Israel, a commitment to social justice, and cultural elements such as music, literature, art, philosophy that are also part of Jewish life.
 The racial appearance of Jewish Americans is very diverse and can range from light skinned to Middle Eastern to Jews of color, including African American Jews, Asian American Jews, Latino/a/x Jews, and Native American Jews. Jewish families include multiracial households, and there are diverse appearances both within families and within communities.
 Many Jewish Americans trace their ancestry to Eastern Europe, and their racial appearance reflects this.
 Many Jews with light skin identify with the idea of white-presenting, which recognizes the divergence between external classifications and internal identity.
 There are several major Jewish ethnic subgroups:
 Mizrachi Jews are racially diverse Arabic- and Farsi-speaking Jews indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa for over 2,500 years.
 Sephardic Jews are originally Ladino-speaking Jews expelled from Spain and Portugal to North Africa and the Ottoman Empire beginning with Spain's expulsion in 1492.
 Ethiopian Jews are Amharic-speaking Jews originally from Ethiopia.
 Ashkenazi Jews are Yiddish-speaking Eastern European Jews.

 Major languages and literature of Jewish expression include English, Hebrew, Arabic, Yiddish, Ladino, and Farsi. Hebrew, the language of Jewish scripture, is often a lingua franca that has united different Jewish ethnic subgroups.
 American Judaism has a range of religious denominations, including Reform, Conservative, and Orthodox, with a range of observances and practices. At the same time, Jews are united by shared sacred texts, like the Torah, by celebrations, traditions, and a feeling of connection to other Jews around the world.
 Jews have a wide range of opinions and beliefs about what it means to be Jewish and how Jewish identity is defined.
 Across Jewish denominations, ancestry marks a person as Jewish regardless of the individual's personal level of religious observance. Traditionally, a person was considered Jewish if born to a Jewish mother. Reform Jews among others consider a person with a Jewish father to also be Jewish.
 Jews consider a person who converts to Judaism, without Jewish ancestry, to be as Jewish as any other Jew.
 Jews are part of the Jewish American community by birth, adoption, marriage, and by throwing their lot in with the Jewish people through conversion, or being part of a Jewish family.

racialization - When a group becomes categorized as a stigmatized group, and that group is seen as a separate race by another dominant group.[3]
conditional whiteness - When a person or group can gain racial privilege by dropping ethnic markers of difference or assertions of belonging to a separate group. A person or a group can become white conditionally, on the condition of not being ethnically or religiously different, assimilating or passing as white.

racial formation - Race is socially constructed rather than fixed, biological, or from time immemorial. The structure, or formation, of racial hierarchies vary in different times and places. Racial formation theory states that race is composed of ideas about race and the social structures of racial stratification in a particular time and place. Racial categories and boundaries can change over time and place, and a group can become racialized, that is, categorized as a stigmatized group, or be seen as part of a dominant race.[4]
antisemitism - Hatred, discrimination, fear, and prejudice against Jews based on stereotypes and myths.
Jewish Americans, Antisemitism, and Race
 The first Jews to arrive in 1654 to what became the United States were Sephardic Jews from Brazil.
 In US immigration and naturalization law from 1898 to 1941, Jews were categorized as part of the "Hebrew race." This racialization deemed Jews as non-white.
 A large wave of Jewish immigrants came to the US from Eastern Europe between 1880 and 1924. Prejudice against Jews and Catholics from Eastern and Southern Europe and white supremacism motivated the passing of the Johnson-Reed Immigration Act of 1924, greatly restricting Jewish immigration through 1965.
 In addition to targeting African Americans, the white supremacist racism of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) saw Jews as non-white, a separate and lesser race, and targeted Jews, such as with exclusionary immigration legislation and intimidation in large marches on Washington DC.
 For the first half of the twentieth century, Jews were usually not considered white in the US racial formation.
 Through the 1960s, antisemitic employment discrimination with overt and covert "no Jews allowed" notices often led Jews to enter new industries with less discrimination. Elite universities also had quotas, limiting the number of Jews who could attend them until the early 1960s.

 In the 1920s and 1930s, anti-Jewish conspiracy theories were openly distributed in the US, for example by Henry Ford's newspaper (later used in Nazi propaganda) and Father Edward Coughlin's radio show.
 In the 1930s, growing anti-Jewish prejudice in the US led to the US government's refusal of entry to Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany until 1944 after millions were already murdered.
 Jews often changed Jewish sounding names to avoid discrimination, to assimilate, or for reasons of internalized oppression. Starting with immigrants, and common with actors, this practice of name-changing continues to the present day.
 After the full horror of the Holocaust came to light after 1945, American attitudes gradually changed toward Jews, anti-Jewish prejudice decreased, Jews were less often racialized, more frequently able to assimilate, gained conditional whiteness, and began to be considered white by American societal standards. While anti-Jewish prejudice became less socially accepted, it persisted.
 Descendants of Jewish immigrants often assimilated and changed their position on the racial hierarchy from their immigrant parents, gaining racial privilege.
 White supremacists continue to racialize Jews as non-white. This was evident when the Unite the Right March in Charlottesville chanted "The Jews will not replace us" with "us" referring to white Americans. See https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-offaith/wp/2017/08/14/jews-will-not-replace-us-why-white-supremacists-go-after-jews/
 Jewish institutions continue to be targets of hate crimes, including synagogue shootings in Poway, CA in 2019, and Pittsburgh, PA in 2018.
 Light-skinned Jews simultaneously experience white privilege on the basis of their appearance and prejudice, discrimination, and systematic antisemitism on the basis of their Jewishness.
 Jews of color like all communities of color face systemic racism, and simultaneously face prejudice and discrimination on the basis of their Jewishness.

 Jews of all skin colors who are visibly Jewish, from their appearance, name, or religious clothing or symbols (e.g., a Star of David necklace), experience more overt antisemitism.
Reflections on Jewish American Identity
Excerpts from I Am Jewish: Personal Reflections Inspired by the Last Words of Daniel Pearl. Edited by Ruth Pearl and Judea Pearl. Woodstock, VT: Jewish Lights Publishing, 2004.
1. Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl is an Asian American Rabbi ordained by Hebrew Union College. She spent her college summers working as head song leader at Camp Swig, a Reform Jewish camp in Saratoga, California.
"My father is a Jew and my mother is a Korean Buddhist. As the child of a mother who carried her own distinct ethnic and cultural traditions--and wore them on her face--I internalized the belief that I can never be "fully Jewish" because I could never be "purely" Jewish. My daily reminders included strangers' comments "Funny you don't look Jewish"), other Jews' challenges to my halakhic [Jewish law] status, and every look in the mirror.
Jewish identity is not solely a religious identification, but also a cultural and ethnic marker. While we have been a "mixed multitude" since Biblical times, over the centuries the idea of a Jewish race became popularized. After all, Jews have their own language, foods, even genetic diseases. But what does the Jewish "race" mean to you if you are Black and Jewish? Or Arab and Jewish? Or even German and Jewish, for that matter? How should Jewish identity be understood, given that Am Yisrael [people of Israel] reflects the faces of so many nations?
Years ago... I called my mother to declare that I no longer wanted to be Jewish. I did not look Jewish. I did not carry a Jewish name, and I no longer wanted the heavy burden of having to explain and prove myself every time I entered a new Jewish community. My Buddhist mother's response was profoundly simple: "Is that possible?" At that moment I realized I could no sooner stop being a Jew than I can stop being Korean, or female, or me. Judaism might not be my "race" but it is an internal identification as indestructible as my DNA.

Jewish identity remains a complicated and controversial issue in the Jewish community. Ultimately, Judaism cannot be about race, but must be a way of walking in this world that transcends racial lines. Only then will the "mixed multitude" truly be Am Yisrael." (pages 19-20)
2. Naim Dangoor was a leader of Iraqi Jewry outside Iraq.
"When I was a young boy a teacher at school asked me, "Why are you a Jew?" I, with all the practicality of youth replied, because I was born one!"
There is, however, something in this sentiment that rings truer than one might think Judaism is a birthright, a glorious gift from one's forefathers of faith, culture, and heritage.
For me, it is this: my strong Babylonian heritage, the heritage that Daniel Pearl also shared, his mother having been born in Baghdad, that makes me so proud to be a Jew. Babylonia was one of the main birthplaces of the Jewish people, from where Abraham emerged as a founder, and later from where the Babylonian Talmud, forming the framework for Rabbinic Judaism, was created. Its glorious Jewish intellectual eminence fanned out across the known world for more than a thousand years. Currently the descendants of this tradition are spread throughout the globe." (pages 97�98)
3. Julius Lester is an African American civil rights activist and writer.
"It is the particular responsibility of the Jew to suffuse history with holiness. This is not something that, done once, is done for all time. It must be done every day, for every day a Jew must choose anew the responsibility of holiness.
To be holy is to be apart from, the Torah teaches us. We must be apart to possess our unique identity as a people. We must be apart to offer the world those aspects of the holy which God put into our keeping.
There is a paradox: The world needs us to be apart as Jews, though it may be loath to acknowledge it. It does not need us to be just another ethnic group. It does not need us to dissolve our particularity into an undifferentiated and colorless mass.
The world needs us to assume the difficult task of living as Jews and to do as Jews have sought to do through the ages past -- merge past and present and future into a Holy Now.

We do this by becoming a continuous bracha [blessing] -- a blessing of joy that refuses to be suppressed or destroyed despite what others have said and done, despite what others say and do. To be a Jew is to be a bracha of laughter expressing our surprise, delight, and wonder in creation and our place in it as Jews. We are called to be a bracha of unending love because to be a Jew is to be in love -- with a God, a people, and a land. To be a Jew is to live that love -- boldly, defiantly, joyously --to become that love and live with the fluidity of a melody understood in the silence of the soul.
To be a Jew is to be a love song -- to the God of our people -- and to the world." (page 144)
4. Norman Lear is a writer, producer, and social activist.
"I identify with everything in life as a Jew. The Jewish contribution over the centuries to literature, art, science, theater, music, philosophy, the humanities, public policy, and the field of philanthropy awes me and fills me with pride and inspiration. As to Judaism, the religion: I love the congregation and find myself less interested in the ritual. If that describes me to others as a "cultural Jew," I have failed. My description, as I feel it, would be: total Jew." (page 34)
5. Douglas Rushkoff is a writer, journalist, and professor of media studies.
"Jews are not a tribe but an amalgamation of tribes around a single premise that human beings have a role. Judaism dared to make human beings responsible for this realm. Instead of depending on the gods for food and protection, we decided to enact God, ourselves, and to depend on one another.
So out of the death cults of Mitzrayim [Egypt] came a repudiation of idolatry and a way of living that celebrated life itself. To say "l'chaim [to life]" was new, revolutionary, even naughty. It overturned sacred truths in favor of living sacred living.
...
It's important to me that those, who throughout our history, have attacked the Jews on the basis of blood not be allowed to redefine our indescribable process or our internally evolving civilization. We are attacked for our refusal to accept the boundaries, yet sometimes we incorporate these very attacks into our thinking and beliefs.

It was Pharaoh who first used the term Am Yisrael [People of Israel] in Torah, fearing a people who might replicate like bugs and not support him in a war. It was the Spanish of the Inquisition who invented the notion of Jewish blood, looking for a new reason to murder those who had converted to Catholicism. It was Hitler, via Jung, who spread the idea of a Jewish "genetic memory" capable of instilling an uncooperative nature in even those with partial Jewish ancestry. And it was Danny Pearl's killers who defined his Judaism as a sin of birth.
I refuse these definitions.
Yes, our parents pass our Judaism on to us, but not through their race, blood, or genes -- it is through their teaching, their love, and their spirit. Judaism is not bestowed; it is enacted. Judaism is not a boundary; it is the force that breaks down boundaries. And Judaism is the refusal to let anyone tell us otherwise." (pages 90�91)
6. Ruth R. Wisse is a professor of Yiddish literature at Harvard University.
"The American way of life affords us the freedom to live as we please, within the bounds of the law. We may choose to live as Jews, visibly and vitally or else slip anonymously into the Gentile [non-Jewish] mainstream.
Since I've always enjoyed being a Jew it never occurred to me to live otherwise. I appreciate the tough-mindedness of the Jewish religious tradition that knows how hard it is to achieve a mature civilization; I admire my ancestors who brought Jewish civilization to such a high level of maturity. Although I don't follow all the requirements of Halakhah [Jewish law], my observance is higher than that of my parents whose observance was lower than that of their parents. I love the cycle of the Jewish year, particularly the contrasted experiences of Rosh Hashanah and Passover. The cultural and history of the Jewish people engage much of my intellectual energy. And the pleasure of being a member of the Jewish community usually outweighs its frustrations." (pages 7�8)
7. Senator Dianne Feinstein is the senior US Senator from California since 1992.
"I was born during the Holocaust. If I had lived in Russia or Poland -- the birthplaces of my grandparents -- I probably would not be alive today, and I certainly wouldn't have had the opportunities afforded to me here. When I think of the six million people who were murdered, and the horrors that can take hold of a society, it reinforces my commitment to social justice and progress, principles that have always been central to Jewish history and tradition.

For those of us who hold elected office, governing in this complex country can often be difficult. My experience is that bigotry and prejudice in diverse societies ultimately leads to some form of violence, and we must be constantly vigilant against this. Our Jewish culture is one that values tolerance with an enduring spirit of democracy. If I've learned anything from the past and from my heritage, it's that it takes all of us who cherish beauty and humankind to be mindful and respectful of one another. Every day we're called upon to put aside our animosities, to search together for common ground, and to settle differences before they fester and become problems.
Despite terrible events, so deeply etched in their souls, Jews continue to be taught to do their part in repairing the world. That is why I've dedicated my life to the pursuit of justice; sought equality for the underdog; and fought for the rights of every person regardless of their race, creed, color, sex, or sexual orientation, to live a safe, good life. For me that's what it means to be a Jew, and every day I rededicate myself to that ideal." (pages 228�229)
8. Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie is President Emeritus of the Union for Reform Judaism who focuses on interfaith relations and social justice.
"I am Jewish. This means, above all else, that I was present at Sinai and that when the Torah was given on that mountain, my DNA was to be found in the crowd...
A people is usually defined by race, origin, language, territorial or statehood, and none of these categories is an obvious common denominator for the worldwide Jewish people. Peoplehood is a puzzling concept for modern Jews, particularly the younger ones, who often cannot understand what connects them to other Jews in Moscow, Buenos Aires, and Tel Aviv. But I am convinced, to the depth of my being, that Jewish destiny is a collective destiny... It is the covenant at Sinai that links all Jews, including non-observant ones, in a bond of shared responsibility. And if we hope to strengthen the unity and interdependence of the Jewish people, we will have to revive the religious ideas on which these notions are based." (pages 114�115)
9. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a Justice of the U. S. Supreme Court from 1993 to 2020 and advocate for women's rights.
"I say who I am in certain visible signs. The command from Deuteronomy appears in artworks, in Hebrew letters, on three walls and a table in my chambers. "Zedek, zedek, tirdof," Justice,

Justice shalt thou pursue," these artworks proclaim; they are ever-present reminders to me what judges must do "that they may thrive." There is also a large silver mezuzah [Torah verses in a small case] on my door post...
I am a judge, born, raised, and proud of being a Jew. The demand for justice runs through the entirety of Jewish history and Jewish tradition. I hope, in all the years I have the good fortune to serve on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, I will have the strength and courage to remain steadfast in the service of that demand." (pages 201�202)
10. Kerri Strug is an Olympic Gold medalist in gymnastics.
"I have heard the same question over and over since I received my gold medal in gymnastics on the Olympic Podium. "You're Jewish?" people ask me in a surprised tone. Perhaps it is my appearance or the stereotype that Jews and sports don't mix that makes my Jewish heritage so unexpected. I think about the attributes that helped me reach that podium: perseverance when faced with pain, years of patience and hope in an uncertain future, and a belief and devotion to something greater than myself. It makes it hard for me to believe that I did not look Jewish up there on the podium. In my mind those are the attributes that have defined Jews throughout history." (page 98)
11. Sarah Rosenbaum is 15 years old from Southern California.
"When I say that I am Jewish, I am identifying myself as part of a tradition, connected to our foremothers and fathers, and carrying on to the future a culture, a religion, a way of life. I feel pride and am overwhelmed with joy when I declare that I am part of this incredible people, our people Israel." (page 54)

Sample Lesson 42: Arab American Stereotypes in Literature, Film, and Media Pre- and Post-9/11
Background
The term Arab has changed and evolved over centuries due in part to the migration of the Arabic-speaking inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula. Early Arabs traveled extensively through

Commented [6]: This should be in the Asian American section.

Asia, North Africa, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa for business and trade as well as through military campaigns as the Islamic Arab empire grew. While the original Arabic-speaking people may have been of one race, modern Arabs are far more ethnically and racially diverse due in large part to this movement.
Today, Arab is used broadly to describe any person from a nation where Arabic is the main or one of the main languages and for whom Arabic is one of their primary languages.
While Arabs are ethnically diverse, they do share some common bonds aside from language. Arabs are generally practitioners of Abrahamic faiths--Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The predominant religion of most Arab nations is Islam; however, there are also large populations of Orthodox and Catholic Christians as well as Jews. There are also some similarities in cultures, social structure, and cuisine, although each nation is unique.
Arab Americans are as diverse as the nations they represent. Today's Arab American population includes, but is not limited to, Christian Arabs and Muslim Arabs and represent a broader cross-section of the Arab world. The map below shows the concentration of the Arab American population un the United States, as well as the composition and characteristics of some of the largest groups.
Selected Population Characteristics
 The Census Bureau estimates that at least 1.9 million Americans are of Arab descent; AAIF estimates that the number is closer to 3.7 million.
 Arab Americans live in all 50 states, but two-thirds are concentrated in 10 states; onethird of the total live in California, New York, and Michigan.
 About 94% of Arab Americans live in metropolitan areas. Los Angeles, Detroit, New York/NJ, Chicago, and Washington, D.C., are the top five metropolitan areas of Arab American concentration.
 Lebanese Americans constitute a greater part of the total number of Arab Americans residing in most states although in Georgia, New Jersey, and Tennessee, Egyptian Americans are the largest Arab group.
 The largest Arab American community in Arizona is Moroccan, Rhode Island has a plurality of Syrian Americans, and Nebraska and South Dakota have a plurality of Sudanese.

 While the largest Palestinian population is in California, the greatest concentration of Palestinians can be found in Illinois.
 There are almost as many Iraqis living in Michigan as there are living in California, even though California is over three times larger than Michigan.

Unit Title: Arab American Stereotypes in Literature, Film, and Media Pre- and Post-9/11
Unit Overview:
Prior to this lesson students should be introduced to the experiences of Arabs and Arab Americans, including seeing them as a diverse group with a history stretching back over a century in California and across the country. In this unit, students will conduct a short study on how Arabs have been imagined in America through literature, film, and media. This imagination usually profiles Arabs as uncivilized or in opposition against common American ideals. The lessons in this unit seek to understand the Arab American experience by including Arab American voices within American culture. The diversity of the mediums��from film to literature� �takes perspectives from both the dominant American view and the Arab American view. Students will practice their critical and analytical skills through close readings, discussions, and writing. After studying these mediums, students will identify and explain various literary techniques, motifs, and other devices.
The unit's goal is to illuminate the contributions and struggles of the Arab American experience while also revealing how not just Arab Americans��but many US citizens in general can be influenced by structural racism and bigotry. And to provide an understanding of how our citizens have a universal obligation to replace negative stereotyping with true narratives about our neighbors.
This unit could be conducted as an end-of-semester ethnic studies course.
Unit Enduring Understandings:
1. Students will understand how Arab Americans have been stereotyped and profiled in America.

2. Students will learn how the Arab American community contributed to America by engaging with authentic narratives. Essential Questions: 1. What false Arab portrayals exist in America, and how long have Arab Americans countered these portrayals? 2. What laws and policies have impacted the experiences of Arab Americans?

Lesson Purpose and Overview: This lesson allows students to develop critical reading and writing skills by understanding the presence of historically marginalized populations in America. This lesson aims to teach close reading techniques and help students become conscious of early American literature's subtle stereotypes of historically marginalized populations and ethnic communities. Students will read portions of chapter 4 from F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, a chapter that contains a brief song lyric about Arabs. The specific scene of focus is when Jordan Baker and Nick Carraway discuss Jay Gatsby's relationship with Daisy Buchanan. While reading this chapter, the instructor will provide key literary terms��like "symbolism"��and ask the students

to find Gatsby's attraction to Daisy. The instructor will then ask the students to read a song lyric that starts with, "I'm the Sheik of Araby" and ask what the song symbolizes.
Students will discuss this passage and its literary symbolism within the book. After the discussion, the instructor will play the actual song and discuss the historical background of the Sheik imagery and Arab stereotype within American popular culture during the 1920s. The stereotype is of an overly aggressive and hyper-sexualized Arab man. The students will then write some stereotypes they believe the song is portraying on the board.
The students will conclude by reading a passage from Deserts of Facts and Fiction by the Arab American writer Ameen Rihani, who counters the stereotype. This passage, written by an original Arab American voice, will expose students to how Arabs may feel about such stereotypes. The students will then match their opinions and vocabulary words with Rihani's writing, discussing some similarities and differences. They will then be assessed by writing responses to exit questions.
Key Terms and Concepts: Arab and Arab Americans, symbolism, hyperbole, stereotype
Lesson Objectives:
1. Students will closely read a passage from The Great Gatsby that subtly stereotypes Arabs as immoral and aggressive.
2. Students will be able to counter the stereotypes by reading Ameen Rihani's opinion of Western views as fantasy and fiction.
3. Students will be able to use new vocabulary to write an analysis that illustrates how these stereotypes are perpetuated.
Essential Question:
1. How long have false portrayals of Arabs existed in America?
2. What do Arab Americans think of these portrayals?
Lesson Steps/Activities: Class time��55 min

1. Before beginning the discussion, define what it means to be Arab and the composition of the Arab American and California Arab populations

2. Open Discussion: Ask, "Who has read The Great Gatsby?" (~ 10 min)

a. Provide facts of the book for students who don't know

i.

Written by F. Scott Fitzgerald

ii. Set in the 1920s during the Jazz Age

iii. The Great Gatsby is about Nick Carraway telling the story about how another man named Gatsby tries to fake his wealth to make a girl named Daisy fall in love with him.

b. Briefly describe the immigrant historical context.

i.

The book was written while immigrants from all over the world

were coming into America, especially from the Middle East.

c. Introduce Chapter 4

i.

Chapter 4 of The Great Gatsby is vital in describing

multiculturalism perceptions in America compared to Gatsby's desires for

Daisy.

ii. For example:

As we cross Blackwell's Island a limousine passed us, driven by a white chauffeur, in which sat three modish Negroes, two bucks and a girl. I laughed aloud as the yolks of their eyeballs rolled toward us in haughty rivalry.

"Anything can happen now that we've slid over this bridge," I thought; "anything at all..."

Even Gatsby could happen, without any particular wonder.

3. Chunking Activity (15�20 min)

a. If the class size is about 25 students, then break students into six (6) groups of four (4) with one group of five (5).

b. Provide students with a list of vocabulary words and literary devices:

i.

Vocab: Desire

ii. Devices: Symbolism, Hyperbole (Exaggeration)

c. Provide students with Chapter 4 of The Great Gatsby

d. Scaffold students by reading this brief portion of the chapter out loud: (2�3 min)

One October day in nineteen-seventeen--(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a straight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)--I was walking along from one place to another half on the sidewalks and half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on shoes from England with rubber nobs on the soles that bit into the soft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the wind and whenever this happened the red, white and blue banners in front of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut in a disapproving way.

The largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to Daisy Fay's house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and by far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She dressed in white, and had a little white roadster and all day long the telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp Taylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that night, "anyways, for an hour!"

e. Ask students: "What is the tone of this writing, happy or cheerful? What part of this paragraph makes Daisy appear very desirable?" This is meant to help warm- up students with their reading and interpretation.

f. Continue the scaffolding: (2 min)

When I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was beside the curb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had never seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she didn't see me until I was five feet away.
"Hello Jordan," she called unexpectedly. "Please come here."
I was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the older girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red Cross and make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she couldn't come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was speaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at sometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the incident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby and I didn't lay eyes on him again for over four years--even after I'd met him on Long Island I didn't realize it was the same man.
g. Ask: "Do Gatsby and Daisy seem to be in love?" Again, this is meant to serve as a close-reading warm up.
h. Activity: Provide students with this closing passage from The Great Gatsby. Ask them to read silently. (5 min)
When Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza for half an hour and were driving in a Victoria through Central Park. The sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in the West Fifties and the clear voices of girls, already gathered like crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:
I'm the Sheik of Araby,
Your love belongs to me.
At night when you're asleep, Into your tent I'll creep �

"It was a strange coincidence," I said. "But it wasn't a coincidence at all." "Why not?"
"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay."
Then it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that June night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of his purposeless splendor.
"He wants to know--" continued Jordan "--if you'll invite Daisy to your house some afternoon and then let him come over."
The modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and bought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths so that he could "come over" some afternoon to a stranger's garden.
"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?"
"He's afraid. He's waited so long. He thought you might be offended. You see he's a regular tough underneath it all."
Something worried me.
"Why didn't he ask you to arrange a meeting?"
"He wants her to see his house," she explained. "And your house is right next door."
"Oh!"
"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some night," went on Jordan, "but she never did. Then he began asking people casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It was that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard the elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately suggested a luncheon in New York--and I thought he'd go mad:

" 'I don't want to do anything out of the way!' he kept saying. 'I want to see her right next door.'

"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom's he started to abandon the whole idea. He doesn't know very much about Tom, though he says he's read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of catching a glimpse of Daisy's name."

It was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm around Jordan's golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her to dinner. Suddenly I wasn't thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more but of this clean, hard, limited person who dealt in universal skepticism and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my arm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: "There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."

"And Daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured Jordan to me.

"Does she want to see Gatsby?"

"She's not to know about it. Gatsby doesn't want her to know. You're just supposed to invite her to tea."

We passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of Fifty-ninth Street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. Unlike Gatsby and Tom Buchanan I had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so I drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. Her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so I drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.

Lesson Purpose and Overview:
This lesson builds off Jack Shaheen's Reel Bad Arabs and explores Arab portrayals in American film. Using Shaheen's framework, the lesson will help students identify how Arab characters are portrayed as: A Villain, a Sheikh, a Maiden, or a Slave/Servant. Students will view portions of The Sheik and examine the film for stereotypes. Then, depending on the instructor, students can view three other films for stereotypes: Ben Hur, Network, and True Lies. Students will discuss why this is problematic and will be asked what some solutions are to improve such stereotypes in film.
The students will be assessed by writing a portrait of one of the caricatures, explaining what makes that character a hyperbole of Arab stereotypes. The student will also be asked to come up with a possible script or movie idea that portrays Arabs positively.
Key Terms and Concepts: Arab and Arab Americans, Archetype, Stereotype, Caricature, Hyperbole, Film, Hollywood, Movies

Students can use this as an interethnic bridge to apply what they have learned regarding Arab American portrayals pre-and post-9/11 to other populations. Additionally, students could look at the past or to see the history of how Native Americans, other members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander population, African

Americans, Latina/o/x and Chicana/o/x and others are being targeted. This project should challenge existing and past stereotypes in order to provide a positive alternative. The main requirement for this assignment is to heal instances of profiling, stereotyping, and racialization. Students will develop their product based on the materials that were read and viewed throughout the week. Through this project, students will have the opportunity to imagine futures with understanding, collaboration, and a sensitivity of the Arab American experience.
Students will begin by writing a brief overview of their imagination and provide the reasoning behind their views. They will then choose the medium as to which they will deliver their alternative history. For example, a student could choose to write an idea for a new film script that changes old movies' stereotypes. Alternatively, students could draw a picture or make a comic book. Or students could write a poem or essay.
Students will provide a short paragraph about their alternative history. This paragraph will provide evidence gathered from their previous readings, giving students opportunities to learn how to cite evidence and use them in their projects.
Key Terms and Concepts: Arab and Arab Americans, Futures, Narratives
Lesson Objectives:
1. Students will be able to create an original perspective through their chosen method of production (art, writing, film script, etc.)
2. Students will be able to write a paragraph that uses sources and evidence to defend their original perspective.
3. Students will be able to demonstrate sensitivity and understanding of the types of stereotypes that affected the Arab American community and understand the types of contributions brought by the Arab American community.
Essential Questions:
1. How would Arab Americans be portrayed if 9/11 did not happen?
2. What can American society do to challenge negative tropes and appreciate Arab American contributions?

Sample Lesson 43: Armenian Migration Stories and Oral History
Theme: History and Movement Disciplinary Area: General Ethnic Studies Ethnic Studies Values and Principles Alignment: 1, 3, 6 Standards Alignment: CA HSS Analysis Skills (9�12): Historical Interpretation 1 CA CCSS for ELA/Literacy: RH.9�10.1, 3, 8, 10; WHST.9�10.2, 4, 6, 7, SL.9�10.1, 4, 5, 6 CA ELD Standards: ELD.PI.9�10.1, 5, 9, 10a Lesson Purpose and Overview: As part of a larger unit on migration and oral history, this lesson guides students to explore the role of oral histories in historiography, with a particular focus on Armenian personal stories. The goal of this lesson is to understand the history of Armenian migration to the US and delve deeply into the Armenian-American experience. This lesson uses the voices of Armenian women, men, girls, and boys through oral histories, to create an understanding of the nuances and experiences of the Armenian-American Community. The students will learn about how Armenian migration stories connect to their local history. Key Terms and Concepts: oral history, Armenian migration, interviewing, archive, memory Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
1. evaluate perspectives on history making and historiography through the lens of oral history;

Commented [7]: Armenia is technically in Asia, so it could be grouped in the AAPI section.

2. watch, listen to, and conduct oral history interviews, transcribe narratives, develop research questions, and build upon interpersonal communication skill; and
3. better understand the diversity of experiences of Armenian-Americans by synthesizing and analyzing oral history sources.
Essential Questions:
1. What is the significance of oral history in the construction of minority histories in the US? 2. What is the history of Armenian immigration to the US? 3. How did various cohorts and generations of Armenian immigrants' experiences differ
from each other and that of their children who were born in the US?
Lesson Steps/Activities:
Part I: What is Oral History?
1. Ask students to write down a response to the question: What is history? This could be in one word, quick responses, or a paragraph response to a writing prompt. Have students share responses in a class discussion. See where students have similar ideas about what defines history.
2. Follow up questions: How do we know what happened in the past? Who writes history? 1. There are many ways we know about what happened in the past (journals, objects, legal documents, photos, letters). Discuss the students' answers and how they relate to what we know about the past. 2. Point out that historians look at a lot of different topics when they study history. They might study politics, wars, big national events, important things we might see on the news. But, historians also study the everyday lives and activities of "regular" people. 3. For upper high school grades and college students, the discussion can focus on historiography and notions of what makes good, proper history.
3. All of these ways we know what happened in the past are considered primary sources. Where do you usually go if you want to learn something? (common answers: books, internet, Wikipedia)
4. These are all considered secondary sources. Primary sources are first-hand accounts of an event or moment in time and are in their original form. Secondary sources are books

or articles that use a variety of primary sources to provide commentary on an event, but these are created by people who do not have first-hand knowledge of the event. 5. Have students do some basic research using key search terms such as ArmenianAmericans, Armenians in America, Armenians in California, Armenians in Los Angeles, etc.
1. Look at scope of various existing resources for documenting Armenian communities worldwide and California in particular.
2. Divide students into groups and assign each group one of the following categories to explore.
3. Each group should discuss and report on what each of these resources brings to the study of Armenian-Americans and also what each resource may lack. Questions of sample size, representation, depth, disciplinary lens, scope, date of publication, geography, and more can be addressed in this discussion.

� But Why Glendale? A History of Armenian Immigration to Southern California, 2019
Despite its many contributions to Los Angeles, the internally complex community of Armenian Angelenos remains enigmatically absent from academic print. As a result, its history remains untold. While Armenians live throughout Southern California, the greatest concentration exists in Glendale, where Armenians make up a demographic majority (approximately 40 percent of the population) and have done much to reconfigure this homogenous, sleepy, sundown town of the 1950s into an ethnically diverse and economically booming urban center. This article presents a brief history of Armenian immigration to Southern California and attempts to explain why Glendale has become the world's most demographically concentrated Armenian diasporic hub. It does so by situating the history of Glendale's Armenian community in a complex matrix of international, national, and local events.

iii. Food Journalism:
� Liana Aghajanian: In L.A., Armenians' Disparate Food Traditions Live Side by Side
A food journalist looks at the various components that make up part of the modern Armenian food lexicon in Los Angeles. In fact, in order to understand the ancient, diverse, and often tragic history of Armenians, one can start by looking at the food they eat. But this story isn't an easy one. It's complex, reflecting the frequency with which Armenians have had to remake their lives as refugees or immigrants in foreign lands.
Armenians have been conquered over millennia by the Byzantines, Romans, Turks, Persians, and Russians. They have also been displaced across the world because of war, revolution, and genocide. Because of this, Armenians are not made up of one place, but of many. Nowhere is

this more apparent than in their cuisine, and in no American city is this better reflected than Los Angeles. It is here where these fragmented histories merge and blend, where Armenians have managed not only to find some permanence but to use food as a way to showcase and unify their diverse and scattered nation.

6. One way we know about the past is by doing oral history. What is oral history?
Oral history is the systematic collection of living people's testimony about their own experiences. Oral history is not folklore, gossip, hearsay, or rumor. Oral historians attempt to verify their findings, analyze them, and place them in an accurate historical context. Oral historians are also concerned with storage of their findings for use by later scholars.
As an example, teacher leads students to look at the USC Institute of Armenian Studies Displaced Persons Documentation Project, which documents the community of Armenians-Americans that formed during and after WWII, through oral histories. Students can take a look at the photos, historical overview, and sample oral history testimonies.
https://armenian.usc.edu/displaced-persons-documentation-project/
Part II: Why is oral history important? How does it add to history?
7. Discuss as a class why oral history is important. Emphasize that it is important to understand people's stories and their experiences related to an event. We all have stories to tell, stories we have lived from the inside out. We give our experiences an order. We organize the memories of our lives into stories. Oral history listens to these stories. Historians currently recognize that everyday memories of everyday people, not just the rich and famous, have historical importance. If we do not collect and preserve those memories, then one day they will disappear forever.

8. Oral history accounts add the life to the facts. And they give voice to people, regular people, who often aren't involved in writing history.
9. Review publicly available segments from the #MyArmenianStory archive and follow up with the following questions: After reviewing the example, why do you think oral history is important? How does it add to historical accounts? Do you understand the facts differently after listening to the oral history account? Sometimes statistics and numbers are difficult to relate to. But we might be able to relate to an account of someone's life as told in their own words. 1. Compilation #MyArmenianStory oral history submissions

Part III: Doing Oral History
10. Explain to the class that they will be conducting some of their own oral histories to learn about the Armenian experience.
11. Advise students to think of the person they wish to interview. The teacher can provide a list of Armenian organizations, institutions, and community centers students can utilize. This will serve the dual purpose of familiarizing students with the Armenian presence in California while helping them find an interview subject.

12. Have the student determine what they hope to discover about the person's life. In preparation for the interview, the student should research the following: 1. Historical and significant events

2. Social and economic conditions 3. Culture and other interesting information about the time 4. Appropriate linguistic skills based on which language(s) they'll be conducting the
interview 13. Have students review the #MyArmenianStory Guidelines, Interview Guides, and
FAQs from the USC Institute of Armenian Studies #MyArmenianStory project in detail. https://armenian.usc.edu/myarmenianstory/. 14. Review best practices in interviewing; watch/listen to several sample oral history recordings; conduct mock interviews in class. 15. Students should set up an appointment with the interviewee. They should be prepared with recording equipment and the question guides. 16. Students can ask the interviewee if they have any letters, photographs, or objects that they would like to share and use these for their final product in class. 17. Students may be asked to transcribe the interview. The process of transcription offers new insights on the content in a written medium.
Part IV: Analysis and Reflection
18. Students are given a choice in the creative medium (interpretive paper, PowerPoint presentation, newspaper article, digital history videos, podcast, portfolio, etc.) with which they would like to present their findings and analysis of their interview. The analysis may focus on: 1. A summary of their findings 2. What were some of the most interesting things they learned 3. What they found out that was surprising 4. What the stories of the interviewee tell us about a certain time period or event 1. Perhaps discuss how what they learned from the interview conflicts with what they know or what they have learned about in school 5. Further questions they would ask if they could go back to learn more and clarify some points
18. After the whole class presents their findings, you may want to discuss and reflect on some themes, such as 1. the constant movement and migration; 2. the process of adaptation and integration;

3. the common threads and unique elements of the various interviews; 4. intersectionality of identities; and 5. the value of oral histories as primary resources. 19. Students should carry out a series of reflections throughout the process at various stages. The reflections can cover sociocultural, sociolinguistic, and historical observations. For example, students can journal about their expectations before the interview, the experience during the interview, and how their oral history interview reflected or changed their thinking about central themes. Encourage students to compare and contrast themes, perspectives, and experiences based on the oral history projects. 20. Share students' oral history projects with the larger school community by organizing an oral history viewing/listening event.

Third Field Review Draft
This appendix provides information for educators and administrators on asset-based and culturally relevant pedagogies that focus on the strengths that students bring to the classroom. For more information, see the California Department of Education's web page at https://www.cde.ca.gov/pd/ee/assetbasedpedagogies.asp.
Sample Safe Spaces and Community Building Activities
The following activities allow students to share information about their identities, families, interests, and backgrounds. By incorporating these types of activities into lessons, students will gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of their peers and educator, better connect and

identify with ethnic studies content, and work to build a safe classroom environment that is grounded in collaboration, compassion, empathy, and vulnerability.
Who I Am/Where I'm From Poems
This writing activity is designed to help students share their backgrounds with their peers.
Have each student pull out a sheet of paper. Ask them to write a three-stanza poem that speaks to their identity, background, and where they are from. Let them know that each line of their poem should start with "I am From..." and should be followed by something specific to their life, upbringing, and identity. Providing examples is highly encouraged. Allow students 10�15 minutes to write their poem. After everyone has finished writing, have each student share their poem with the class.
Human Barometer
This teaching strategy helps students share their opinions by asking them to line up along a continuum based on their position on an issue. For detailed instructions on how to conduct this activity, see https://www.facinghistory.org/resource-library/teaching-strategies/barometer-takingstand-controversial-issues.
Gallery Walk
This activity has students move around the room to respond to multiple texts or images. For detailed instructions on how to conduct this activity, see https://www.facinghistory.org/resourcelibrary/teaching-strategies/gallery-walk.

Affirmations, Chants, and Energizers
This section includes several ethnic studies-oriented chants, proverbs, and affirmations. These can be used as energizers to bring the class together, build unity around ethnic studies principles and values, and to reinvigorate the class following a lesson that may be emotionally taxing or even when student engagement may appear to be low.
The Ethnic Studies Community Chant
At Social Justice Humanitas Academy (SJHA), a part of Cesar Chavez Learning Academies (CCLA), in the Los Angeles Unified School District, various Ethnic Studies unity chants were combined into one and are recited in a call and response format. The chant grew to this form over the course of seven years from the school's opening, as different parts were learned and integrated from various intercultural sources. Here the chant itself is presented, with the words in parentheses indicating the chant leader's part and the other words indicating the community's response. The bold text are proclaimed by all. An audiovisual link of the chant is provided here (https://tinyurl.com/y42zhcuu), as are the translations and languages of origin, and brief hxrstories of each part, as taught at SJHA/CCLA. Though the chant was first taught and led by the Ethnic Studies teacher at the school, soon enough students started leading the unity chant themselves in contexts inside and outside of school. Student leadership of the call and response is encouraged. Lastly, as powerful as reciting the chant is, living it daily with each other and all our relations is exponentially more challenging, and thus, this is a core goal of Ethnic Studies that the unity chant reminds us of.

The Meaning of the Ethnic Studies Unity Chant

The Unity Clap itself has no words. It is all in the language of sound, which resonates with people across the planet; it comes to us from the United Farm Workers (UFW) movement, which built upon the labor of Pinoy organizers including Larry Itliong and Philip Vera Cruz, and which the man our campus is named after, Cesar Chavez, was a co-founder of. The unity clap represents the united heartbeat of the people.
Si Se Puede is Xicanx Spanish for "Yes It Can Be Done"; it also comes to us from the UFW, which Dolores Huerta was also a co-founder of. It represents that no matter how difficult or insurmountable our challenges and situations may be, we can come together in unity, and do what must be done to confront our challenges together. Dolores taught it to us when she visited our campus. We have a mural of her on the 1st floor, and she was also awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Obama.
Harambee Umoja is from the Pan African language of Swahili and means "All Come Together; Unity." Umoja has been taught as a principle of the Nguzo Saba, the African American celebration of Kwanzaa which began in the 1960s, and Harambee relates to African American chants that are shared in various parts of the U.S. today, including at the Duke University/Children's Defense Fund Freedom School.
Kemakatzin Mochihua is from the American Indian Nahuatl language, a language original to Mexico, El Salvador, and the Southwest United States, and it means "Si Se Puede" or "Yes It Can Be Made to Happen" in the Nahuatl language. It was taught at Plaza de La Raza in Los Angeles California, an arts and culture center which was founded in 1970.
Isang Bagsak is from the Pinay/Pinoy Power Movement and the Tagalog language of the Philippines, and in context translates as "One Struggle Down, Many More to Go." One representation of this is that sometimes it's a struggle to even bring people together and have a good meeting, and once that happens, there is still much more work to do. We learned it on our SJHA college tour to UC San Diego.
Holla Back, We Got Ya Back! This part of the African American social justice tradition was also learned on our SJHA college tour to UCSD. An interview with UC San Diego and SJHA Alumnus German Octaviano shares, "as we know it through oral story...it originally comes from Black women at the University of Wisconsin. They wanted to call attention to the low numbers of African American men at the university while at the same time calling attention to the

disproportionate incarceration rates of Black men." We emphasize an expression of support for each other through this part of the chant.
Amandla, Awethu. This part of the chant is related to the late great Social Justice leader, Nelson Mandela; it is in African Nguni languages (including Bantu, Zulu, and Xhosa) and comes from Black South Africans and their resistance of Apartheid segregation. As a part of this resistance, they would share a rallying call, Amandla, Awethu, which translates as "The Power is Ours!"/"Power to the People!"
Panche B� & In Lak Ech. These concepts come from the Mayan tradition and were taught to us by the Tucson Mexican American Studies/Ethnic Studies program, which right wing Arizona lawmakers outlawed under HB 2281 (since declared unconstitutional), even though students were achieving higher graduation rates, higher college going rates, higher standardized test scores, and better attendance. In Lak Ech translates as you are my other me and relates to our habit of mind, empathy, and also compassion, interdependence, ecology, love, and mutual respect. Panche B� translates as seeking the roots of the truth, and the truth of the roots, and relates to profound critical thinking/critical consciousness and activism. SJHA Onward! In Lak Ech.
In Lak Ech Affirmation
The following is also based on In Lak Ech (love, unity, mutual respect) and Panche Be (seeking the roots of the truth) as is elaborated by Roberto Cintli Rodriguez in Our Sacred Maiz is Our Mother: Indigeneity and Belonging in the Americas. However, this chant goes a level deeper into the Nahui Ollin (Four Movements), as taught by Tupac Enrique Acosta of Tonatierra, and integrated by ELA teacher Curtis Acosta formerly of the Mexican American Studies Department of Tucson Unified School District (before Arizona HB 2281). This is an adaption of the Nahui Ollin, into poetic, rhythmic, hip hop song form.

Tatlong Bagsak
Isang Bagsak (one down) is adopted from a ritual used by Anti-Martial Law activists in the Philippines. To show unity, Isang Bagsak was powerfully proclaimed by a member of the movement and in unison the community would make a loud sound either by clapping or stomping. As time has gone on, various activist organizations have borrowed the use of Isang Bagsak to show unity at their marches, protests, meetings, and events.
Started by Artnelson Concordia, a teacher-activist-scholar, Isang Bagsak was combined with the Unity Clap, which some have attributed to the Farm Workers Movement. The combination of the Unity Clap and Isang Bagsak starts off with a slow clap and crescendos in a faster pace clap that culminates into someone yelling Isang Bagsak and the community responds with a single clap or stomp that shows their togetherness.
Pin@y Educational Partnerships (PEP), rearticulated both the Unity Clap and Isang Bagsak by creating the Tatlong Bagsak ritual. The Tatlong Bagsak ritual also begins with the Unity Clap and then is followed with someone yelling Isang Bagsak to represent our past together, then the community responds with one clap or stomp, then it is the quickly followed by an Dalawang Bagsak (two down) and the community claps or stomps two times and this represents our present work together. To end the ritual, someone yells Tatlong Bagsak (three down) and the community claps or stomps three times and this represents our future journey together.
