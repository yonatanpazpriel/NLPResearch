It is horrendous that I have to write an email to ask that you not name Jews as privileged in the ethnic studies curriculum. How many times do we have to write in and tell you guys to stop this anti-Semitism in your curriculum? How have jews been privileged when they had to go through the holocaust and move from their homes from the Middle East because of persecution? This is disgusting. We will fight this.
