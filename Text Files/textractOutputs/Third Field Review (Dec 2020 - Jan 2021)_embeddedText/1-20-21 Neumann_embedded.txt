From: Neumann Family Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum- expressing my concerns
I realize that we have until Thursday to let you know, as the general public, our concerns in regard to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
As an educator myself who specializes in the teaching of the Holocaust, Genocide and Discrimination, I find this curriculum biased. Why is it that the authors feel it is okay to link the Jews as the only group where the term "privilege" is used? I reviewed your curriculum and saw that while the word is part of the lesson plans, but it is not attached to any other ethnic group. Basically you are teaching reverse discrimination ï¿½ "them" against "us." I am appalled at the lack of reflection and bias with which this is being written and would like to know how this can be corrected?
Sincerely, Monise Neumann
