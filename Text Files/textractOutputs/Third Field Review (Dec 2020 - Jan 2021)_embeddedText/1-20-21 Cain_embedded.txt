From: Cain, Steve Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Feedback on Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good afternoon.
I noticed that Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. The word appears elsewhere, but not attached to any other ethnic group.
Jews, who represent roughly 0.2% of the world's population and roughly 2% of the U.S. population, are again targeted for their "privilege." Seems Anti-Semitic to me! We should want to help students widen their sense of "us" vs. teaching students to harden their sense of "them."
I strongly recommend that you remove the word "privilege" from the curriculum, as it's referenced today.
Best, Steve
