From: [email redacted] Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 5:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to object to this proposed state-wide mandatory model curriculum as it is currently drafted. This draft will further fuel the rise of anti-Semitism and should not be allowed to be a part of any curriculum, much less a mandatory part of the curriculum. My family and I strongly object to the same.
Thank you.
