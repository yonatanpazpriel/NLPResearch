From: Leah Schwartz Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:01 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] I am a Jew
I wish to voice my strong opposition to referring to Jews as "privileged".
Also, does the committee know, that the earlier practice of American Jews changing their names, to less Jewish sounding ones, occurred because of anti-semitism? Thankfully, this practice has been out of use for many years now.
Please, please, do not let this new ethnic studies curriculum, help to bring back the necessity of hiding our Jewishness again.
Sincerely, Nancy Schwartz
