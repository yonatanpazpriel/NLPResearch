Hello. I believe that the entry of this program in the public schools is not for the purpose it states is its intention. I believe it is an extreme knee-jerk reaction to the public's attention being placed on inequities of people living together on this planet. The education plan is biased in that it assumes everyone is not understanding the plight of the other person and needs to be educated in what some feel is the correct way. I understand some will be made to stay silent and not give comment while others share their oppression. This is meant to make the oppressed feel heard and the listener automatically guilty of that oppression. It is political tool and the California Department of Education will be the puppet if this is allowed to occur. STOP THE SANITY.
