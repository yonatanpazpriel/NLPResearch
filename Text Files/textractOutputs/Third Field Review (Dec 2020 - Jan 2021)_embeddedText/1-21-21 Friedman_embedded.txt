From: Eric Friedman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies model curriculum
I am writing to object, in the strongest terms, to the way in which Jews are singled out as enjoying "conditional " white privilege at the very same time that the last president sought support in the arms of neonazis in both Charlotte and in the Capitol.
In this country, two groups have to worry about physical security in houses of worship. Blacks and Jews. No one shoots up a Catholic Church.
Whoever wrote this part of the curriculum is clearly grinding an axe unbecoming of a scholar. Californians deserve better.
