From: [email redacted] on behalf of Brian Wren [email redacted] Sent: Monday, December 7, 2020 12:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Protect Butler's Palestinian students
Dear The Instructional Quality Commission CA,
As a supporter of Jewish Voice for Peace, I am writing to express my disappointment at the the treatment of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.
Arab American studies belongs within Asian American studies, not relegated to the index of the ESMC ï¿½ and the fact that Palestine is not mentioned at all is completely unacceptable. Students deserve an education that isn't hampered by anti-Palestinian lobbying. A robust Arab American series within the ESMC is absolutely critical.
California often paves the way for progressive legislation nationwide. But if the ESMC is adopted as proposed, it will be lifted up and promoted by anti-Palestinian organizations as a model for other states.
Furthermore, the IHRA's controversial "definition" of antisemitism must not be included in the ESMC. This definition exists to silence critics of Israel. It has nothing to do with Jewish safety or dismantling real antisemitism. In fact, using accusations of antisemitism for political purposes puts Jewish people in danger. This deeply flawed definition must not become a part of California's statewide curriculum.
I am calling on you to:
1) Return the Arab American lesson plan to where it belongs, within Asian American studies 2) Stop censoring Palestinian narratives from Arab-American lesson plans, and 3) Remove all definitions of antisemitism that conflate criticism of Israel or Zionism to antisemitism
Sincerely, Brian Wren [email redacted]
