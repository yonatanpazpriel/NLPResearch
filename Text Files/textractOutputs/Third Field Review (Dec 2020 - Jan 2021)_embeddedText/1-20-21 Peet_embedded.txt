Hello, I am writing to say that I hope this curriculum is not adopted for the children of California. It is wrong to identify human beings solely, or even significantly, only in terms of whatever sub-groups to which they belong. (as in `intersectionality') It is poisonous, and has been demonstrably poisonous, by these past tumultuous years since its increasing prominence in American society.
Please do NOT adopt this toxic, anti-human curriculum.
