I do not live in California so why this email.
In this picture is my family in Hungary. I only acquired this picture 2 years ago when I was 63. Till then I had no idea what my Grandparents looked like. Till 5 years ago I did not know their names, where they lived and that my late Mother had 3 brothers and a sister.
Why did I not know this basic information?
My late Mother survived Auschwitz and Mauthausen concentration camps. She never said a word about her past but had frequent nervous breakdowns. I assume her condition was one of the reasons my father abandoned us and was never heard from again and since my Mother was too sick and traumatized to care for us, we were sent to foster care, separated from our older sister.
In this photo, my Grandparents, Aunt and her 3 year old boy were gassed on arrival in Auschwitz. My Grandmother was one of 10 siblings and the only survivor lost his first wife and four children. My Great Grandparents were also gassed on arrival in Auschwitz.
As Jewish children growing up in Montreal we were subjected to ongoing anti-Semitic acts. Children would paint swastikas in our driveway abd chase us with their dogs. Adults would assault us with "Dirty Jew, Christ Killer, Hitler should have killed you all"
We eventually discovered a document where my Mother described the horrific living conditions, severe beatings, extreme starvation and slave labour she endured in the camps. This is the story of many Jews.
Clearly to you, however, we are "privileged"
