The teaching that Jews are European colonial settlers who have stolen the land of Israel from the "indigenous" Palestinians is the reason for the exponential growth of antisemitism in America today. The JIMENA lessons (Jews Indigenous to the Middle East and North Africa) present a far more accurate picture of the 3,000 year Jewish history in the region can change this now widely held false narrative which I believe is the basis for the current growth of antisemitism. It is vital for the California Department of Education to recognize the importance of including these lessons in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. Please tell them that you support this.
