From: Larry Christian Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 2:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Third Field Review
I am extremely disappointed that the ESMC Third Field Review again fails to include the substantive sample Arab American studies lesson plan titled Understanding Arab and Muslim Americans Experiences and Challenges in the United States. This lesson plan was submitted for inclusion in the draft discussed at the November meeting but it was omitted. It was supposed to be included in the Third Field Draft released for public comment on December 7. One again it was omitted.
This omission is egregious. Without it, the experiences of Arab Americans in the sample lesson menu in the EMCS would be limited to stereotypical treatment of Arab Americans in literature and media Such a limitation would belie the ESMC's posture that Arab American studies is a sub-discipline of Asian Studies. Failure to include it after multiple commitments to do so would raise grave questions about CDE''s honesty in dealing with Arab American studies as a legitimate component of the ESMC.
Please live up to past commitments and include the Understanding Arab and Muslim Americans Experiences and Challenges in the United States in the ESMC. In case IQC staff has not forwarded the lesson plan to CDE for consideration, I have attached it.
