From: D Gold Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
It is critically important to the future of California that our schools provide a strong curriculum that directly addresses the struggles and contributions of People of Color. There is no reason to water down the impact of race on people of color. Please maintain all the lesson plans which concerned Californians have contributed and allow local teachers the choice of including what best meets the needs of their students. Please do not give into the organized right wing attack on what they call Critical Ethnic Studies.
The inclusion of As a Californian of Jewish ethnicity, I think it is important that you not listen to the organized attacks which have been launched by some organizations seeking to deny the experience of Arab Americans and to undermine the importance of ethnic studies maintaining the focus on People of Color. This is not the time for watered down concepts of "multi-culturalism". Our schools must be a place where we can confront racism and where we can support an understanding of our actual history, including how we can confront colonial settlement, slavery, and their impacts on how we live now. Please restore the thoughtful curriculum that was initially developed for this project.
Thank you D. Gold Pacifica CA
