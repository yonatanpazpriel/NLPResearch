It appears that there's still no accountability, evaluation, monitoring, or evaluation to see if this stuff works in raising student achievement or has some other, more amorphous, good result. If it doesn't raise student achievement, what good is it? And is it right to spend the time, energy, resources, and money during two pandemic years when a great many K-12 students are missing out on getting any worthwhile education? Wouldn't the resources of the California Dept of Education be better spent on solving those problems, rather than on these made-up ones, that don't accomplish much except stir up ethnic and racial strife?
