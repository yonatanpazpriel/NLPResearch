Re: Maintain Key Improvements in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Dear ESMC Public Comment Inbox, Thank you for your hard work and efforts to revise and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The latest ESMC draft contains key changes and additions that I urge you to maintain, including: � Important references to antisemitism, including information about its origins and ongoing prevalence in the United States � Lesson plans that highlight and explore the diversity of the Jewish community, Jewish identity, and the Jewish American experience � The removal of explicitly antisemitic and anti-Israel content � Safeguards to help prevent hatred and bias in California schools Antisemitic incidents and hate crimes targeting members of the Jewish community, including Jewish students, have been steadily rising in recent years, as have other similar forms of bigotry. Education is a critical tool for combating hate and promoting respect and social harmony. To that end, teaching about the diverse cultural histories, important contributions, challenges and triumphs of California's numerous ethnic communities is long overdue and more essential than ever. The ESMC will impact the education of millions of students and the importance of maintaining the improvements outlined above cannot be overstated. Thank you again and please continue to embrace the core values of inclusion, equity, and balance within the curriculum. Sincerely, Nina Anderson [contact information redacted] San Francisco, CA 94127 Constituent
