To then IQC
I am troubled by the proposal to include "Critical Race Theory" in K-12 curriculum. Every child is born into different circumstances (gender, ethnicity, income). However; it is not what you start out with, but how you strive to succeed that determines your life's outcome.
Critical Race Theory categorizes and separates everyone into little groups where they are victims or bullies. They are neither. Children are extraordinary creatures filled with hope and potential that your theory squashes.
Teaching children to get along with each other and treat each other with respect and love will serve individuals much better. We should embrace the differences rather than form little groups that must fight all the other little groups. This takes away individualism and self-determination, which is what made this country great. Of course, if you want to destroy the future of these children, Critical Race theory is the path you will take.
Please respect the children you are pledged to serve and help all them to achieve their God given potential. Teach them to thrive and not be categorized victims or bullies when they are innocent of any wrong doing. Do not teach them that they cannot achieve their potential because of their ethnicity. Do not turn hope into despair. Give each wonderful child a chance to achieve all that they can. Do NOT destroy our youth with Critical Race Theory. Sincerely,
Cynthia Schafer
