From: Diana Hanson Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Anti-Semitism
I'm extremely concerned that, yet again (this is the third time), California is proposing an ethnic studies program that tilts toward anti-Semitism. Who do you get to write these curricula? One has to wonder...I'm sick and tired of the vilification of Jews... You state Jews are a 'privileged' minority? How is that? Very privileged to have lived generations being persecuted in the Middle East and Europe.... Families who had to change their names to be less Jewish in order to get jobs in the US? These are all realities. Do you realize that many Jewish Americans, like many Black Americans cannot trace their family history back more than a couple of generations?
Perhaps, by using "critical race theory" and the 1619 project, you have fallen for the canard--truly an ahistorical canard--that Jews are not indigenous to Israel--go back and learn some real history.
Stop the anti-semitic libel. Do not pass this problematic ethnic studies program.
Sincerely,
Diana Hanson
