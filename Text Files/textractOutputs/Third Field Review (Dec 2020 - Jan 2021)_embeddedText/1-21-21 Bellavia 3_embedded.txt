We do NOT need your CORRUPT leftist, Socialist atheist political propaganda "Ethnic Studies" programs, in our California schools! As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King correctly taught, "We are only ONE RACE-- THE HUMAN RACE!" Other fine political leaders-- like Mahatma Gandhi-- taught the same thing! Children need to learn kindness, love and respect for one another! As Christ taught, "love God and your fellowman!" All the other religions-- Judaism, Buddhism, etc.-- teach the same thing! Teach the kids Good Morals (same thing in all religions!) DO NOT teach children CORRUPT leftist political propaganda garbage! America was originally founded on good, solid Judeo-Christian Biblical religious principles-- the very best, in the whole world! Linda Bellavia
