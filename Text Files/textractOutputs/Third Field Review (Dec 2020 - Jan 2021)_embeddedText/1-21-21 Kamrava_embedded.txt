To whom it may concern:
I find it absurd and appalling that Jews are the only group referenced as being "privileged," first of all. Second of all, Jews who appear to have light skin are still discriminated against plenty of times JUST for being Jewish. What a ridiculous statement. Also, how about white passing Arabs or Muslims, do they not also have privilege? How convenient to leave that out.
Outrageous and shameful. I would never allow my children to be subjected to this curriculum as it is written now.
