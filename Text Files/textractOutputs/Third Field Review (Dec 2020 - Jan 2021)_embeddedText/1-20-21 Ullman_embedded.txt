From: Holly Ullman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 1:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE Model Curriculum
I am a resident of Santa Clara County, a member of teh Jewish community, a parent, and a family law attorney. I urge you to reject the Critical Ethnic Studies framework as divisive, counter the oriignal priciples of inclusiveness. and a set-up for hatred among studants. However based on several troubling features of the most recent proposed version, it is bound to create an esepciallyh toxic atmosphere for Jewish students.
I ask the committee to reject all of the following 1. Thank you for the definition of antisemitism as a form of bigotry. BUT Please Do NOT allow it to be watered down so it fails to reflect the actual experience of Jewish communities and Jewish students. 2. Do not include ( either in footnotes or lessons) material by figures who are known to have promoted antisemitism. 3. Exclude all reference to Jews and "privilege" (""privilege" isn't applied to any other named group.) 4. Exclude material that pits Middle Eastern Jews and "whiter" Jews against each other. Exclude material that states or implies that Jews of European origin are "passing." There were common Nazi tropes against Jewish communities who had assimilated and contributed to German society. Given the rise in domestic and global antisemitism, the type of material will serve to stoke the flames.
Thank you for your attention. Holly Ullman Stanford, CA
