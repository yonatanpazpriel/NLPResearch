From: Seema Grover Wong Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies curriculum and Jewish "privilege"
Dear Ethnic Studies,
What I'm reading about the way Jews will be portrayed in California curriculum terrifies me.
Anti-semitism has NO PLACE in our public education, especially in a country already wracked by white supremacy violence. White supremacists do not consider Jews to be white, no matter a person's skin tone, any more than they consider Muslims or Sikhs to be white. But we don't hear about Muslim privilege or Sikh privilege or light skin Latinx privilege. Only jews.
Attaching the term "privilege" to a marginalized group that was denied shelter in the United States during the Holocaust AND after, and is still a target of racial hatred in the United States in every country in the world, is perverse and dangerous.
The Jewish people have historically always been on the vanguard of the civil rights movement for all marginalized groups in America, because we identify with their struggles. We know exactly how fragile our security is. We're reminded of that fragility with every hate-based murder and every assault on places of worship. We see the numbers rising. What a time to feed division.
I'm horrified that the state of California intends to teach antisemitic, "us vs them" genocidal tropes to breed distrust in a new generation of children. Stop it.
Sincerely,
Seema Grover Wong
