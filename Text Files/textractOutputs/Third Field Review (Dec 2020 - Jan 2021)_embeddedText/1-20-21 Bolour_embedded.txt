Dear Chairperson,
I urge you to deny passage of the proposed mandatory Ethnic Studies Curriculum in California. It divides people using racial distinctions and singles out the Jewish people as having racial privilege. Jews are the ONLY group in the curriculum for whom the word "privilege" is used and yet our temples and schools are being victimized at a greater rate with hate speech graffiti and violence in the past few years. We can all remember that in April of 2019 there was a shooter that opened fire on congregants at a Temple in San Diego. Over the past few years, we are seeing an increasing number of antisemetic violence targeting the Jewish community.
In a time of surging anti-Semitism, this biased curriculum will only contribute to the growing hatred and divisiveness. I urge you to vote against this current curriculum as it will only contribute to greater divisiness and hatred among the students of California.
Thank you for your consideration, Dr. Sheila Bolour
