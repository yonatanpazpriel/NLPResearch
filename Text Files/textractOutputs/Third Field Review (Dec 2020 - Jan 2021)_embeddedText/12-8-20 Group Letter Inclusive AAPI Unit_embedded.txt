Dear California Department of Education Instructional Quality Commission,
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) position that the following revisions be made to the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the IQC in November 2020:
1. Restore lesson plans on Cambodian Americans and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (as a pan-ethnic group) that were present in the July 2019 draft, specifically curricula on: - Myths and Realities Surrounding the Asian Pacific Islander American Community - Cambodian Americans ï¿½ Deportation Breaking Families Apart
2. At minimum, include additional lesson plans for Japanese Americans, Korean Americans, Vietnamese Americans, and Asian Indian Americans. These ethnic groups represent some of the largest Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) ethnic groups according to 2010 Census data.
The "Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" unit must offer the foundational overview of the AAPI pan-ethnic identity, include the full spectrum of the AAPI community, and align with the expansive CDE vision imagined in Chapter 3. I urge you to protect and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and reach out to AAPI community stakeholders to review lesson content for authenticity and prior to submission to the IQC in November.
3. As a first generational Chinese, I know what it is like to grow up being part of the only Chinese family in a small town (Scranton, PA). I wish there were class lessons about the Asians (let alone Chinese) in school to give me support for being "different". I was stared at, told to get off their property, asked if something was wrong with my eyes, called names, etc. Other students and parents would have benefited knowing the history of Asians, Pacific Islanders, etc. Ignorance of facts breeds stupidity, racial discrimination, poor self esteem, etc. What's civics without world knowledge?
Sincerely, Theresa Frances Kuo Cool and definitely chic senior! Retired Occupational Therapist
