IB History of the Americas takes a broad look at the American experience, including that beyond US borders. Because the perspective of IB courses is global, students in IB history courses explore how peoples and societies have historically impacted each other. Historical perspective is a critical part of our inquiry and students are routinely asked to examine different points of view as they learn about events and trends of the past. This includes an emphasis on the experiences of minorities in the US. For example, in a recent assignment students were asked to write about the annexation of Hawaii from the indigenous Hawaiian point of view. Class discussions about Current Events also explore multiple perspectives.
