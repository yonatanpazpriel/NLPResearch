From: Liora S Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 12:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment about Appendix A Line 10513
I wanted to propose removing Appendix A, Line Sample Lesson 41, Line 10513, Question 11d: "When, how, and which Jews have experienced racial privilege?"
While some Jews feel that they have white privilege as white-passing members of society, asking the question in a speculative manner is harmful because it emphasizes Jewish privilege in a time when antisemitism and hate crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions are on the rise, including at high schools in California. Instead of inviting students to speculate about scenarios in which Jews may not have actually experienced privilege, it is preferable to use the existing examples that explain when Jews have already self-identified as having privilege.
