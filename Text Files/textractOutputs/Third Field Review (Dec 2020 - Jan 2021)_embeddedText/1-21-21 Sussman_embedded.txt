From: Marge Sussman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing as an anti-racist and anti-Zionist Jew in support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum as originally drafted, which includes Arab American Studies within Asian American Studies. Ethnic Studies was created to lift up the voices and histories of oppressed peoples whose histories and voices have been denied and obscured. The attempt to exclude Arab American studies is an example of the battle that students committed to ethnic studies fought and won.
As a Jew committed to collective liberation and social justice, I reject the use of our history to deny the histories of others fighting for liberation and against injustice, racism, and colonialism today. I am appalled that our trauma as Jews, our experience of antisemitism in the past and present, is being weaponized against the very people whose liberation is essential to the liberation of all people.
The Zionist version of our complex Jewish history should not be inserted into the Ethnic Studies curriculum; this is an attempt to erase the lived experiences of the Palestinian people of colonization and expulsion, and to marginalize Arab American Studies.
