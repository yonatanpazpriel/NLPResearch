Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used.
There ought to be no discussion about Jews and privilege that doesn't begin by talking about the historically enacted and repeated genocidal ideology that revolves around Jews and privilege. For an ethnic studies curriculum to go traipsing through that discourse without a single mention of its ugly and bloody history is not a lesson about anti-Semitism. It is a repetition of it. By itself, that should effectuate a vote of no confidence in the entire franchise.
Critical race theory is not the historical equivalent of Nazism, but it doesn't have to be: the question is whether an American education will help students widen their sense of "us," or once again, teach students to harden their sense of "them."
Sincerely, David Wheeler Santa Maria, Ca
