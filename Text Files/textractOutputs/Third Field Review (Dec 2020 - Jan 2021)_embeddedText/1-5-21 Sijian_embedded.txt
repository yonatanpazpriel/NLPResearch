From: Ge Sijian Sent: Tuesday, January 5, 2021 12:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Gracege Subject: [EXTERNAL] Stop ESMC (Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum)
Dear Sir/ Madam,
I really want to oppose ESMC, which is not fair. We should not treat people differently based on their skin color.
Thanks and please vote No and stop ESMC.
Best, Grace
