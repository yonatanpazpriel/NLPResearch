From: Loren Naiman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 3:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] The curriculum supports anti-semitism.
Portraying Jews as privileged belies the suffering that has gone on in years past and perpetuates concepts of antisemitism. Please ensure that this is removed in the final draft.
