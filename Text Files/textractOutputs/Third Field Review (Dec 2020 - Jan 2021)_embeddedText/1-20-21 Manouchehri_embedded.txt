From: [email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:42 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies - Jews should NoT be categorized as privileged
Hello, I believe that categorizing Jews as privileged is based on anti Semitic beliefs, completely ignoring thousands of years of persecution. Please don't give into such hatred when falsely categorizing Jews as bad. It is promoting anti Semitic beliefs.
Thanks,
