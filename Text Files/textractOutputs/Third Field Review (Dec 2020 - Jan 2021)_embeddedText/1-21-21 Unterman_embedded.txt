From: Jeremiah Unterman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] On the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern: As a published scholar who has taught the history of antisemitism at the University of California, Irvine (and elsewhere), I am appalled at what I read about the way the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum treats Jews. Please see this article published on Jan. 19 in the Los Angeles Jewish Journal: https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/327667/jews-haveuntil-thursday-to-influence-ethnic-studies-curriculum/ As the respected academicians who are the authors of the article contend, the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will indeed be a model - for the enshrinement of antisemitism in the California public educational system. Rest assured, if this curriculum passes in its current, antisemitic form, every legal, non-violent method and means will be used to destroy it and hold its perpetrators accountable. The Jewish people and other good citizens of the United States will not accept systemic antisemitism anywhere in America. Sincerely yours, Jeremiah Unterman, Ph.D. (Univ. of Calif., Berkeley)
