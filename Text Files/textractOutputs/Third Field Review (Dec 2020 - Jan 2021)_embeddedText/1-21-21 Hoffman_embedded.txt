From: Roma Hoffman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: [email redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment
To whom it may concern: I am an immigrant from Poland whose fathers family were all killed during W WII, he was the sole survivor. The curriculum on ethnic studies must be reviewed and changed to rid it of anyi-Jewish bias. It is unfair and dangerous to not only Jewish students but also to others who are not aware of the terrible history of Antisemitism. To associate the word privilege with only one group-the Jewish people, is morally and historically wring! Please contact me if you need further information as to how this could impact people and would have a negative ripple effect. Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. Sincerely, Roma Adelman Hoffman Teacher of Students with Special Needs Austin, Texas
