Ethnic Studies Curriculum Developers,
I am concerned about the current curriculum and encourage you to take another look and consider a broader direction for this teaching. It's important to present history including the many mistakes of the past and also highlight the successes, the things that have made ethnic groups in California and America proud.
What have been the issues, what has been done to address these? Put together student groups to discuss these issues and what still needs to be done? Knowing what we know now, how can we deal with these challenges? What are the obstacles and challenges we face in our efforts to make progress here? How can we overcome these obstacles and challenges? New ideas will form, options will be considered and seeds planted in the minds of students. Education, thinking and problem resolution, not indoctrination. This is how we come up with new approaches. Inspire students to embrace new ways of looking at the problems of society.
If we teach victimhood, we produce more victims. If we show opportunities for the future in spite of our past, we pave the way for a better future for all.
Identify and bio key individuals who made a difference, the contributions of immigrants and ethnic persons. Who made a positive impact? Highlight entrepreneurs and emphasize possibilities for innovation and problem solving. Focus on our contributions to the arts, technology, the economy, the movements that have brought about positive change. Inspire thoughts about how we can take these efforts further and include all persons in the future. The purpose of learning history is to move forward in a purposeful manner toward a future of understanding and possibilities.
Thank you for your consideration,
Ann Smith
