Anti-semitism is real and is happening now on CA high school and college campuses. Please do not ignore and exclude the existence of Anti-semitism and hatred against Jews in CA. Adopt and teach the IHRA working definition of Anti-semitism, make it an integral part of ESMC. As demonstrated in the violence at the Capital in Washington DC, in Charlottesville and in Poway (CA), chants of "Jews will not replace us.", t-shirts glorifying "Camp Auschwitz and countless conspiracy theories about Jews controlling the media, banks and spreading Coronavirus can't be ignored. Education is the best way to combat prejudice and hatred against Jews. This is an opportunity to change the rising tide of Anti-semitism in California, include a positive portrait of Jews in the ESMC. My mom is a survivor of Auschwitz, my kids are in CA high school, I implore you not to be silent or complicit. Make the choice to be truly inclusive.
Thank You, Elaine Fellenbaum [address redacted] Orinda, CA
