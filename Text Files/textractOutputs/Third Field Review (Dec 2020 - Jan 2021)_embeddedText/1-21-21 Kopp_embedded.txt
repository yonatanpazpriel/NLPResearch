From: Phyllis S. Kopp Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:14 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
The proposed draft is ANTI-SEMITIC, dangerous, and should be eliminated. The purpose of this curriculum is NOT to enforce stereotyping of any ethnic group! The draft does exactly the opposite and sets Jewish people up for scorn and ridicule.
I was shocked that this language was proposed. Jewish people represent all races, all levels of income and a group whose members have an overwhelming contribution to American culture, medicine, science and government.
