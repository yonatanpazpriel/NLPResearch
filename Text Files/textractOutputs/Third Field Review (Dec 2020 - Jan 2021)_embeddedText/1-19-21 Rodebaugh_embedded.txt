Your efforts do nothing but incite more divisive and discriminatory beliefs. Critical race theory... an abomination created by a group of law school and university elites who only want to make some sort of legacy for themselves. Are teachers, parents or psychiatrists on your committee? What a way to mess with the minds of the young. The program should engage in teaching kids to be confident, proud, productive young people with empathy for all. Learn of other cultures, their strengths, beliefs and their leaders and heroes. Life is a struggle, some will always be better, or average...but never quitters. What thoughtlessness; let's divide our classroom into oppressors and victims. Have a nice day. So much in our lives today is consumed by propaganda, lack of foundation, truth and fomenting that the United States is an evil country. Simplify: A single page statement and let each district create the appropriate curriculum. Then go home ... Your procrastination over 4 or has it been 6 years on this issue is embarrassing. With concern for our childrens' future, Marcia Rodebaugh
