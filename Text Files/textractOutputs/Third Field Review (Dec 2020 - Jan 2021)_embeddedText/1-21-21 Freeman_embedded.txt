From: Freeman, Jennifer Anne Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:48 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum- Depiction of Jewish People
Hello,
I am writing this email in support of implementing the proposed, changing the state-wide Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and the use of the word "privilege" when referring to Jewish people. Given the rampant anti-Semitism and white supremacy groups commanding headlines in our country right now, I think it is imperative that our students not be taught about the "privilege: of Jewish people. This is imparting prejudice into the minds of our students. As a researcher who specializes in Education Policy, I know how influential curriculum can be in shaping the opinions and actions of our students, and this change needs to be made. Thank you.
Best,
