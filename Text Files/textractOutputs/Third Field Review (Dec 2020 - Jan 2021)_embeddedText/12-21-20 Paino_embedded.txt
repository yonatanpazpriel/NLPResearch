From: Rick Paino Sent: Sunday, December 20, 2020 10:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum Change
Do you remember when California went to the "new math" curriculum? It was a disaster. Those of you who are in charge of educating our most precious assets, our children, must not forget that the only way to ensure strong leaders in the future is to teach the true history of our country. All the good and the bad. We can only ensure a true democracy in the future if our children understand how we have made this country such a great place to live by learning from our mistakes. Teaching our children that America is nothing more than a white, racist society is reprehensible. I implore you to not destroy our children by the implementation of this terrible curriculum. Sincerely, Richard Paino
