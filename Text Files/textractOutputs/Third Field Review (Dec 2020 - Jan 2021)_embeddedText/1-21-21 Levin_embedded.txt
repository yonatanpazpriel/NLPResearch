There seems to be a mix-up between "privileges" and "rights." I am not privileged if I am not "red lined" when applying for a mortgage, not harassed by police, not followed while in department stores, etc. These are rights, the way any human being ought to be treated anywhere, especially in the United States.
I have no intention of surrendering my rights. What I would like is for everyone else to be treated in a like manner. All clients, customers, suspects or witnesses in a criminal case ought to be treated in a correct manner, regardless of their racial, national or sexual background.
By the way, I and other Jewish people in this country (and throughout the world) also get hassled, though not necessarily in the same way as others. Jews have been killed for being Jewish (Pittsburg), attacked while walking (Brooklyn), and threatened with massacres ("Camp Auschwitz, "6MNE" and "Why Only 6 Million"), plus the usual "Jew-baiting" and "anti-Zionism not anti-Semitism" comments. The internment of Japanese-Americans after Pearl Harbor was wrong; holding American Muslims as somehow responsible for 9/11 was wrong, but American Jews have to overtly demonstrate their independence from Israel and even criticize it.
I have been an American Jew for 77 years: these are not privileges.
