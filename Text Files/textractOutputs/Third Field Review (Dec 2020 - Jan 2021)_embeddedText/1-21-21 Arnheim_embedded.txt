From: Arnheim, Buddy (Perkins Coie) Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:33 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Enough of this anti-Semitic content for our children
Hi,
Please reconsider the proposed curriculum for California's Ethnic Studies course. In its latest form, it perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes and is deeply offensive. We are living in time in which antiSemitism is on the rise, both within our country and around the world; what students are taught in our schools should further understanding, not deepen divisions.
Also, it's beyond depressing that we have to continue playing "whack-a-mole" on this issue. There must be a way to keep us from continually having to request that you not include anti-Semitic material in the curriculum. Please make this a priority.
Thank you Ralph Arnheim Los Altos Hills, CA
