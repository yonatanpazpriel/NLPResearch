From: Mia Adler Ozair Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] NO CRITICAL RACE THEORY
As an educator and parent I fundamentally oppose incorporating anything related to critical race theory in our state's curriculum. It is violently offensive to many and only serves to further divide and insight our state's young minds. We can and must do better.
