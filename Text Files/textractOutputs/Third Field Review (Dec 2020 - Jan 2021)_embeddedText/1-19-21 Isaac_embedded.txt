From: Marlo Isaac Sent: Monday, January 18, 2021 4:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CRITICAL RACE THEORY
Dear CA Board of Education:
By way of this email, I would like to express my disapproval of teachers teaching "white privilege", "racial discrimination" and "gender discrimination" to our young children. These topics require the understanding of a mature adult.. To teach young children these heavy and burdening subject matters will definitely confuse them and ultimately make them bitter in life.
I respectfully ask that you reconsider your educational curriculum regarding "white privilege", racial discrimination", and "gender discrimination" and remove from teaching to our young children.
Thank you in advance.
Marlo Isaac
