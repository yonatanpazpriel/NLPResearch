To whom it may concern:
Thousands of years of "tradition" of unfounded hatred for Jews is rearing its ugly head yet again in your proposed ethnic studies curriculum.
When Jews have lived for centuries in other countries, their communities begin to resemble the physical characteristics of their neighbors: Jews from Ethiopia look African, Jews from Arab lands look like Arabs, Jews from Europe look European, and Jews from Asia look Asian.
Jews in America have been widely discriminated against. Whole cities in the US have had laws against selling property to them until the Fair Housing Act made this illegal. Coops in New York City were invented to prevent Jews from buying apartments on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
Many universities have had an admission policy of quotas for Jews.
Jews had to build their own hospitals because existing hospitals would refuse admission privileges to Jewish doctors.
Like other immigrants to the US, Jews have changed their names to make it easier for others to spell and say them, eg Drumpf became Trump.
This "othering" of Jews has led time and again to their expulsion and murder, leading in the most extreme case to the genocide of 6 million European Jews by the Nazis.
Your proposed curriculum singled out Jews for race-hatred yet again, bringing up the same old canards used to oppress Jews for centuries. It needs revision.
Cordially,
Ira S. Bigeleisen
