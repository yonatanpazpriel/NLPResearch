From: Terry C Sent: Sunday, January 17, 2021 6:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] We reject Critical Race Study
Dear CA Dept of Education:
As Americans, we REJECT Critical Race Study. It is RACIST. It is DIVISIVE. It nullifies an individual IDENTITY. It NEGATES each person as a PERSON. It makes a game for kids to criticize ONESELF through NO FAULT of ONE's OWN, when it is MOST important that we, kids included begin their lives by LIKING THEMSELVES, the very foundation of ONE's SELF-WORTH.
Kids (and we) need to appreciate WHO THEY ARE. Kids also need to appreciate the HARDWORK and DEDICATION of their PARENTS in providing for them, in nurturing them, including sending them to school. Education and basic necessities don't come free, but through the hardwork of their parents.
Americans are the NICEST, KINDEST, MOST GENEROUS people on earth. And we are HARDWORKING people. So we GIVE to those who are less fortunate -- where else do you see in the world there are more Non-Profits? Americans come TOGETHER, form many Community Organizations, by THEMSELVES, without the need of COERCION, to do good by the others.
This CRT (Critical Race Study) is totally unnecessary. It is coercion. Worst still, it is totally DIVISIVE. It is a good WASTE of good money and labor on something created in VACUUM, a LIE, to provide JOBS for the ADULTS, while leaving ALL (kids and parents) with BAD and SelfDefeating feeling.
Parents send their kids to school to to gain KNOWLEDGE, and to learn CIVILITY, to be better persons. Kids need to learn American HISTORY and VALUES. They need to acquire both PRACTICAL SKILLS and proper manners; i.e. how to treat other right.
To DENY one's own Identity is NOT the way to go! And there is NO PLACE for this PHONY teaching!
As such, we OBJECT with the strongest terms this phony Critical Race Study.
Sincerely, Terry Chong San Francisco, CA
