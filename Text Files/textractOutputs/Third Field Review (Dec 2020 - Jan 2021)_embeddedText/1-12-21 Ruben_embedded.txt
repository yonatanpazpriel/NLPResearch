From: Beth Ruben Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 7:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please, no BDS or anti-Israel propaganda
I am writing as a concerned citizen, resident and taxpayer of California. I saw the outline of the previous curriculum draft and was very distressed by the inclusion of BDS material as well as the chapter on the Palestinian conflict with Israel. This seems to me to be highly inappropriate and inflammatory. There is no justification for an international political agenda in the curriculum.
It would be hoped that the study of diversity and ethnic minorities would be in the service of increased tolerance and inclusiveness in our state, not for the purpose of destroying the economy of a foreign country.
Although the number of Palestinian Americans in California is small, less than 6000 people according to Wikipedia, they have a loud and aggressive representation on college campuses. It has been reported that BDS rallies on campus are often followed by increased harassment of Jewish students at the school!
The anti-Israel agenda was included in the previous curriculum draft apparently under the guise of teaching about student involvement and activism. There are more appropriate examples of this, such as protests against racism and police brutality in our country in the present. Student anti-war protests of the 60's and 70's can offer powerful lessons, as can the earlier civil rights movement.
Thank you for your attention to this important matter.
