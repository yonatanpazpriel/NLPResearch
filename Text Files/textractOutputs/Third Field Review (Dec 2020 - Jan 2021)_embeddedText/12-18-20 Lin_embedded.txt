Dear Sirs,
Please do not waste my tax dollars and the time of our students in pushing this agenda.
Just teach them Reading, Writing, and Math. Above that teach them the value of virtuous characters such as kindness, honesty, integrity, mutual respect, and responsibility. That will be enough. Don't introduce color into their curriculum. We are one race, the human race, of varying degree of brownness. That's all. Doing so will only divide us, not unite us. Please do not introduce more discord into our schools.
None of us can pay for the debt of our forefathers because none of us can be absolutely impartial and fair. We can only be responsible for ourselves for what happens today.
Please do not engage in this study as it will only bring about more injustice and will be a waste of our resources.
Sincerely, Kay Lin
