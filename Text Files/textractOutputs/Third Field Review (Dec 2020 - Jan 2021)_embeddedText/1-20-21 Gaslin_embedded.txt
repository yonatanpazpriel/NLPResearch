From: Mayrav Saar Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 1:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ensure the revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum remains free of Israel's delegitimization, BDS and antisemitic content
To Whom it May Concern,
I am writing out of deep concern (and, frankly, sadness) about the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum for the State of California. The curriculum, as proposed, seeks to perpetuate tired antisemitic tropes of the Jew as the vile imposter, posing as something he is not for insidious purposes.
I am particularly alarmed by the prospect that this curriculum would teach children that light-skinned Jews benefit from "white privilege" (please tell the families of the victims of the Tree of Life massacre about all the white privilege that they enjoy). Furthermore, the disgusting opinion that Jewish assimilation is somehow devious, standing far apart from any other ethnic group's assimilation seems written to sow hatred of Jews, plain and simple. How dare the writers of this curriculum suggest that Jews changed their surname to "change their position on the racial hierarchy."
Antisemitism in this country and around the world are rising at alarming rates. Rather than raise the consciousness of students about these hateful acts, the writers of this curriculum gleefully contribute to them.
I ask that these hateful, antisemitic tropes be removed from the curriculum, lest we breed another generation of Nazis and bigots. As someone who was educated through the California public school system, I expect the state to stand as a beacon of truth and hope and inspiration to all. We have an opportunity here to take a stand against injustice and bigotry and I ask, respectfully, that you rise to the challenge.
Thank you,
Mayrav Gaslin
