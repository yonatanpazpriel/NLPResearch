From: markeels Sent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 11:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concern from a minority parent
Hello,
I am writing to express my concern for the "critical ethnic study" curriculum, which is going to be introduced to the public schools in California. After I have read the summary and guidelines, I found the curriculum is problematic because it is self conflicting. The study polarizes the social inequality by labeling it with merely ethnic factors. Not to mention that some degree of social dynamic is an essential part of a healthy social structure, but using simple ethnic attribution to explain the very complex reality to the youths is very irresponsible and toxic.
I urge your committee to re-evaluate the curriculum and be more actually "inclusive" for the mental health of our kids and the future of our nation.
Sincerely,
A very concerned father of two
