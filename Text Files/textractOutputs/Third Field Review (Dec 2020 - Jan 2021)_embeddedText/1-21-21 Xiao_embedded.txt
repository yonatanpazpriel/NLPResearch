From: Yequ Xiao Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 5:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Strongly against the ethnical studies in schools
Dear Madam/Sir,
I am strongly against the current plan to start critical race theory and critical social identities in schools. I am an Asian, and I concern all injustice and racial discrimination in the nation. However, I think we have gone too far about the race and identity issue, especially to favor a certain race in the nation. I think it is more important to unite all people in the country instead of to split them based on race or identities in this difficult time. We don't need to put oil in fire, and I think this study will bring more extreme movement in the school. Let's teach our kids how to be friends and how to work hard to have a better life, instead of brain washing them that all problems come from racial identity problems. So I am strongly AGAINST the plan to have critical ethnic study in school!
Thank you very much!
