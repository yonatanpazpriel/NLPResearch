To Whom It May Concern,
I am writing to express my dismay at the re-introduced Ethnic Studies curriculum and how it negatively and inaccurately portrays Jews. The rhetoric presented in this is eerily reminiscent of Nazi Germany propaganda and has no place in today's environment. The proposed narrative around supposed Jewish privilege and whiteness is factually incorrect and degrading to a population of people who have been persecuted for millennia and are still suffering from inherited generational trauma after the Holocaust. Such propaganda dehumanizes the Jewish people and this proposed curriculum is unconscionable. It is completely irresponsible of California educators to even remotely consider this to be acceptable material to include in a curriculum intended to teach future generations of impressionable minds who innocently trust what they are taught to believe, rightly or wrongly. Perpetuating such falsehoods and anti-Semitism under the veil of trying to combat it is shameful, and I hope this is removed/overturned immediately and without hesitation.
If you aren't sure why this proposed curriculum is extremely problematic and abhorrent to Jews within CA and around the world, please read this article to get more clarity around the pain felt by a population of people who have had to fight for their right to exist for as long as history as been documented.
