Regarding the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum: As you well know, the word, curriculum, is derived from a Latin word, meaning "to run the race/to run
the course." The question is--or should be--what race, or course, do we want California's students to run--now and in the future? The word race, however, has a far different meaning in more modern times; the concern must be just how peoples of varying backgrounds and origins are (going to be) perceived during students' years of schooling.
Currently, the Model seems to single out--or even equate--Jewishness with "white [racial] privilege." Figures who have promoted anti-Semitism use such "racial distinctions" to divide people into (such) "otherness." Jewish people are certainly, by numbers, whether in the U.S. or the world, a minority, not unlike many other minorities in many ways. I would hope that the Model's language will portray Jews in ways, however, that define--and promote the values in--diversity itself.
