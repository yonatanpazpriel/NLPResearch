From: Hildie Spritzer Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
This is a personal note from a retired teacher (34 years)) new teacher coach (Alliant, LMU and OUSD) and parent.
Please make certain that the ethnic studies curriculum looks carefully at bias, taking into account underrepresented populations, content related to religion traditions that serve to inform our students in a non judgmental manner.
How these issues are approached needs to take into consideration how to roll out content, while remaining sensitive to cultural biases. A diverse review board, one that offers various lens on the content should be heard.
As a member of the Jewish community and parent of a bi-racial child and as a student who went to an excellent high school, but was never exposed to executive Order 9066--I implore you to look mindfully at the curriculum and that there will be rich opportunities for staff to be mentored/ resourced through the roll out!
SIncerely, Hildie Spritzer
