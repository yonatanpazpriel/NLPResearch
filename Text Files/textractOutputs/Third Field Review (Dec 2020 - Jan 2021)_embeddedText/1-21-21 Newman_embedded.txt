From: Betsy Newman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comments on CA ethnic studies draft
To Whom It May Concern:
I support an Ethnic studies curriculum and update for CA schools however, the current draft puts forth distortions and lies in the jewish american discussion sections. I am appalled that the intersectionality and white privilege are reserved for the jews only. This facile, simplistic and distorted study guide is a disgrace. The details mattter and unfortunately, whoever wrote this section is promoting false narratives regarding jewish american history, contributions and "whiteness". Jews are the only group singled out for privilege/passing.
I object to the content of these sections and implore you to scrap these sections and get some experts who have a better background in jewish history to develop a more true and nuanced presentation. (there are several other ethnic sections that could use some experts too--but I assume that those of each ethnicity will weigh in)
The import of CA implementing Ethnic studies will affect generations of our children --how they view themselves and each other and will impact our society. It would be a travesty to let this go forward as is. We have lived through the past four years of lies and distortions; let's not be a source of more.
Thank you, Betsy Newman parent, Santa Monica resident
