From: M Levkoff Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:45 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Chapter 3 of your proposed curriculum
In light of President Biden's exhortation to strengthen the unity of our nation, I recommend that you reduce the emphasis on structural differences among ethnicities and instead promote the commonalities among various ethnicities/heritages/identities of people in the USA.
This curriculum could easily be distorted to nourish bigotry.
"Privilege" and "systemic" racism are topics that are already being discarded for their divisiveness. The vocabulary in Chapter 3 is code-language for division. One expression that defies understanding is "black indigenous" unless it refers uniquely to some people in Africa.
Will you include other activities associated with various ancient ethnic histories like cannibalism and human sacrifice? Taking scalps? Saharan raiders who captured subSaharan people for sale? or in more recent times, Black "Buffalo soldiers" killing indigenous people in North America?
Let's move beyond that to embrace what President Biden has recommended.
Thank you. M. L. Levkoff
