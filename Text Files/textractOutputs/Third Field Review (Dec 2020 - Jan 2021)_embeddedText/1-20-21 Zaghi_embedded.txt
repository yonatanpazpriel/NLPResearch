From: Zaghi, Melody Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] proposed curriculum
To whom it may concern:
I am deeply offended at the continued refusal to treat antisemitism with equal emphasis and importance in the proposed curriculum. There is absolutely no reason for this. For example, Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. The unequal treatment of Jews in the proposed curriculum is nothing short of blatant discrimination and hatred.
Today, I read the following article. If you needed any proof that antisemitism is alive and well right here in our back yard, here it is (and there are many many more who feel this way. You could see by reading their blogs and Facebook groups.)
"California Lawyer Farhad Khorasani Calls for Genocide of Jews."
