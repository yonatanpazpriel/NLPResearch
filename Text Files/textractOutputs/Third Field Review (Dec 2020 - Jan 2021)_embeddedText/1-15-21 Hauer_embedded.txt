I am a US Jew who supports education about the Arab American experience from Arabs' own perspective.
My communal organizations like the ADL, fail to understand that it is not up to us to dictate how Arabs are represented.
Please include Arab-American studies, with candid reference to the reality of Palestine in Ethnic Studies.
Thank you, Glen Hauer
