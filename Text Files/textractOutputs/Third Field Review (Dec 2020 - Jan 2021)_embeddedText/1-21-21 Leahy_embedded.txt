From: Karen Leahy Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 3:12 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Curriculum - Ethnic Studies
To Whom it May Concern:
Please reconsider the curriculum promoted. In these times of social unrest and insensitivity toward various ethnic and religious groups, it is imperative we listen to each other and learn to be inclusive and respectful.
This curriculum is neither appropriate nor thoughtful toward our Jewish population and their place in history. As a Caucasian Christian, I am disappointed that curriculum such as this is being promoted. Please consult diverse professionals who will help facilitate the writing of our history texts in order to ensure an accurate, respectful representation of all the people who have contributed to our society.
In this new age, let's listen to each other, and with tolerance and celebration move forward in our views of each other. Let's discover how to teach our children our history without preference toward a skewed vision that puts the mainstream group over others, implying superiority over others. Please consult people of different ethnicities and religions to gain a broader perspective in the process of telling our history.
Your kind attention is much appreciated in this matter.
Respectfully,
Karen Leahy Educator/mother/concerned citizen
