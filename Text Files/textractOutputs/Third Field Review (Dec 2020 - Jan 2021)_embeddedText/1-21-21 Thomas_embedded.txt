It is irresponsible for critical race theory under the guise of ethnic studies to be taught as it stands today. Putting people in to two categories is divisive and discriminatory by definition and should be considered unconstitutional.
People have many identities. Many are mixed race. The agenda is potentially confusing and hurtful, causing many children to question and have negative feelings for themselves, something they cannot change - their race, and also to denigrate many historical figures who lived within the context of their times, and arguably even our country. This is anything but a "sophisticated, dynamic field," and I have watched first hand the negative effects this curriculum on my daughter and her peers.
If you actually studied the customs and beliefs if indigenous peoples with any depth or relevance, that is a curriculum change I could support.
I am also against Gavin Newsom spending our tax dollars on any kind of reparations, other than to indigenous peoples. This should happen on a national level. They are the only ones who deserve this as genocide, decimation of the buffalo population and displacement were terrible attacks on their way of life.
