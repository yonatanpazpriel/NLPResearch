From: Elliot Helman Sent: Monday, December 14, 2020 3:53 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Greetings,
I just received a mass email from Jewish Community Relations Council of San Francisco. The email, with the subject heading of Keep Jews Included in Ethnic Studies includes a link to send a comment. However, there is no way to personalize or change any of the text. The comment contains this sentence:
...we are concerned about efforts to reinsert divisive language and bias that doesn't belong in the classroom and that runs counter to the State Board of Education Guidelines and State Education Code.
There is no explanation of what the divisive language is. I have followed some of the arguments that the JCRC and other organizations that claim to speak for Jews have made to the State Board of Education, as well as to our local SFUSD school board. I would like to emphatically state: SUPPORT FOR PALESTINE AND THE BOYCOTT, DIVESTMENT AND SANCTIONS MOVEMENT IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC.
As a Jew who is deeply involved in my synagogue and Jewish life, I find it absolutely abhorrent that these well-funded organizations are so willing to play politics and subvert the hard work of building solidarity with people of color, just to achieve their narrow, self interests. Zionism is the problem, not anti-semitism.
Thank you.
Elliot Helman San Francisco
