Dear Superintendent Tony Thurmond, California Department of Education and School Board of Education:
We appreciate your effort toward the production of a solid ESMC document to guide our teachers in educating our students. We are writing to make the following request to define a term that is mentioned in numerous places in the current revised version. We believe it makes sound educational sense to include the following meaningful definition, which has become a highly charged and relevant threat to our current Democracy.
In light of Charlottesville and the recent Insurrection events we believe that it is important and relevant to define the following term used in the ESMC:
Our request is that "White Supremacy" be defined, as is "Race," in the ESMC 3rd draft. This would be in the form of an additional footnote (or Glossary if that should be included during revisions) attached to the first use of that term in the ESMC, within the Guiding Principles, on Chapter 1 Line 263. Like the term "Race", this footnote would define White Supremacy using an objective definition from a well-respected source: the Oxford English Dictionary Noun - The belief that white people constitute a superior race and should therefore dominate society, typically to the exclusion or detriment of other racial and ethnic groups, in particular Black or Jewish people.

We appreciate your advocacy and effort in this hugely important task that will impact the ethnic studies education in California, and potentially throughout the country.
