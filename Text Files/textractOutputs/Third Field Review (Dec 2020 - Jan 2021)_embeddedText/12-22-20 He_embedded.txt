From: Rong He Sent: Tuesday, December 22, 2020 4:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] No ESMC in my high school
Dear Committee
ESMC is not welcome in my high school - Lynbrook high. The ESMC curriculum is problematic, not well-designed, and against parents belief. I do not want it to be taught in our high school.
Wish you listen to the parents and support the parents.
Thanks!
Rong, a Californian resident and parent
