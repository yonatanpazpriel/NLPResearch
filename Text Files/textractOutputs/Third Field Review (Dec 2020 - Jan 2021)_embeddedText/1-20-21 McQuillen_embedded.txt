From: Jim McQuillen Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:28 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Input on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum - Native Studies area - round 3
I appreciate all the work and time and effort. The three model lessons on Native American Studies are good and positive for students to learn about. But
It seems there are holes in what is considered model curriculum on Native Studies area such as a clear timeline of the invasion of white settlers and its impact on California tribes from pre-contact to the genocidal state policies into our current times; there needs to be a section on Current issues, problems, Hopes and goals of California tribes; there needs to be a section cultural -community revival of California tribes as well as topics of influence such as the environment, dam removal, gaming, and links for students to learn about the new truth and healing commission set up by Governor Newsome.
