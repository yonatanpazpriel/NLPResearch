As a teacher, I am shocked to read the suggested curriculum: What you suggest is to teach about the people of color period! Instead of teaching about minorities, especially groups that were discriminated in the past: the Chinese community, Japanese, Jewish people and others ethnic communities you teach about one group. Your program will create a division and hate toward the people of color group instead of bringing everyone together. Our children live in a new era where the world is open and their knowledge go way beyond CA and the USA- this is an immigration nation and there are many more ethnic communities that suffer from discrimination in the USA and not because of color but because they come from a different culture.
