From: Jay Tanzman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Anna Krylov Subject: [EXTERNAL] Expanded public comment on the 2021 California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the Commission and the Board of Education:
I would like to voice in the strongest possible terms my opposition to the 2021 California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Despite the claims of its proponents, the model is supported neither by valid educational or sociological theory theory nor valid scientific evidence. The model has nothing to supported it other than the ideological view of its promotors.
Sincerely,
Jay Tanzman
