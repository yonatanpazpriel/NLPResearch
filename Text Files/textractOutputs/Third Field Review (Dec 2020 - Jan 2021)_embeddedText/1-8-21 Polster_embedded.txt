Dear Ethnic SBE members, I wanted to thank you for my concern regarding the Israeli and Jewish American community and the ethnic studies curriculum. I know you have listened to many of us. I feel teaching any type of hatred is completely wrong. I am asking you to continue to remove any BDS or antisemitism in your classes. It only breeds much more hatred and the country seems to have an abundance of that right now. I applaud your recent revisions so this hatred does not grow. Sincerely Gary Polster Carlsbad CA.
