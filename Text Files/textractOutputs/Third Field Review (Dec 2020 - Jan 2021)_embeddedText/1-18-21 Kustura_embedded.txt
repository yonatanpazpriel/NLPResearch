To Whom It May Concern:
I am concerned about the balance of thought in the new ethnic studies curriculum being developed in California. I have read through a lot of the information available online, and while I applaud the efforts to be more inclusive in telling the story of our country, I am also alarmed at the negativity in the curriculum. I come from a family that came here from the former Yugoslavia in the early 1900s. They spoke little English, were Catholic , often referred to as Bohunks. However, within two generations , their children were college graduates, owned homes and small farms and served their country with honor in the military. Discrimination is , unfortunately, part of the human condition. But, it is not the only part . It is a disservice to our children to lead them to believe there is and has been only oppression and limited opportunity in America. We have gone and are continuing to go to great lengths to make our society a better one. This is an on going goal for the human race. In the time I have taken to write this message, people are walking, hiding, getting into unworthy sea craft to get here. They would not come if it wasn't a land of opportunity. My great grandfather and his ten - yes ten!- children knew that and so do we. Please create a curriculum that tells a balanced story for our children. Yours truly, Mike and Julie Kustura
