Dear Dr. Darling-Hammond, Members of the State Board of Education, and Superintendent Thurmond,
On behalf of the Armenian National Committee of America - Western Region (ANCA-WR) Education Committee � representing and advancing the educational policy priorities of the one million strong Armenian-American community in California � I am writing to thank the California Department of Education (CDE) and the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) recommendations the IQC approved in November 2020. We appreciate your efforts and understand the value and importance of Ethnic Studies.
We continue, on behalf of the Armenian Community, to urge CDE to recommend � and the State Board of Education to approve � a fully inclusive approach to ethnic studies, and new lessons that better reflect California's rich ethnic diversity, including the ArmenianAmerican experience.
Our students do not currently see themselves and their experiences reflected in the curricula. Armenian-Americans have long histories of concerns with racialization, immigration, refugeehood as well as legal, educational and linguistic marginalization. Ethnic Studies helps young students make sense of their realities. Our students deserve "culturally / community relevant and responsive pedagogies that are both revitalizing and sustaining" (ESMC 2).

We call on you not to relegate us to the margins of the current CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. We need to be included in the main curriculum and not the appendix. We urge you to hear community voices calling for the inclusion of diverse experiences within Ethnic Studies, and the necessity of Armenian-American histories within that framework. Furthermore, there is abundance amount of resources and lesson plans, based on the framework available and we are ready to provide any support that you may need.

Thank you again and looking forward to hearing from you soon.
