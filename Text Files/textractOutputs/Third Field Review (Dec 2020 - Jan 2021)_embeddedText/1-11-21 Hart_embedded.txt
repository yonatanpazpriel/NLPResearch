RECOMMENDED REVISIONS TO ESMU DOCUMENT
I Give a Prominent Role to Electoral Politics and Government Action The culmination of social protest, avant-garde books/articles and lobbying is often government action influenced by elections and yet this important aspect of social change is largely missing from the ESMC. Examples of defining social change legislation relevant to the ESMC include: The California Fair Employment and Housing Act of 1959, The Rumford Fair Housing Act of 1963, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, The Voting Rights Act of 1965, The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, The Civil Rights Act of 1968 (fair housing), The Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1985, The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, Dream Act of 2001 (not yet enacted), Commission on the Impact of Slavery in California (2020). In addition, prominent elected officials of color, many of whom played important roles in enacting important laws and regulations, are missing from the document including: Barack Obama, Kamala Harris, Alex Padilla, Tom Bradley, Wilson Riles, Xavier Becerra, Antonia Villaraigosa, Willie Brown, Robert Matsui and Norman Mineta. Most of these successful elected officials are from the state and local levels which the ESMC says are important points of emphasis. Why are these elected officials entirely missing from the ESMC?

II Emphasize Group Collaboration SBE guidelines (Chapter 1, page 7, lines 124-125) assert the importance of groups working together yet this objective is hardly touched on in the ESMC draft; documenting collaborative efforts demonstrate the value of group work rather than working in isolation. Collaborative topics worthy of exploration include:
� Environmental Justice - Environmental health concerns (e.g. industrial pollution, poor air and water quality, inadequate open and recreational spaces) continue to have disproportionate impacts on communities and persons of color. Here are some valuable videos, maps and fact sheets concerning environmental justice issues in California:

� Political Campaign Coalitions Building � There is political strength through numbers and coalition building among communities/groups of color is an important means of expanding influence but often requires compromise among coalition partners.
� Poverty � Affects ALL immigrant and indigenous groups - labor organizing and social welfare legislation are subjects worthy of exploration as they can simultaneously have a positive impact among all ethnic groups.
III Expand Discussion of Identity Theme Personal identity involves not only how one is different from others but what one holds in common with others. Put another way, the document ought to focus some on unum and not just pluribus (after all an important American motto is e pluribus unum). A key question ought to be: What does it mean to be an American? (especially given the rich diversity of ethnic groups and experiences in the US). I would suggest it is, in part, an understanding and belief in the U. S. Constitution, especially the 1st and 14th Amendments, free and fair elections, an independent judiciary and the distribution of power among the branches of the national government and the sharing of power with individual states.
Non-political examples of American identity that students may relate to include appreciation of: A) American monuments (e.g. the Statue of Liberty, the US Capitol, the Golden Gate Bridge); B) symbols of American prosperity and commerce (e.g. skyscrapers, malls, transportation facilities, the Internet); C) American natural monuments (e.g. the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Niagara Falls, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the Rocky Mountains); D) the American military (e.g. USMC, Navy Seals, National Guard).
IV Add A Theme on Progress It is striking how little attention is given to progress (and sometimes lack of progress) for groups covered in the ESMC. What was an accurate description of America in 1960 is not necessarily accurate in 2020. Topics for discussion might include:
� Voting rights � Marriage equality � Economic progress � Education opportunity � Political representation � Affirmative action/Reparations
V Include Contemporary Issues Worthy of ESMC Discussion and Research
� Affirmative Action

� COVID 19 (disproportionate impact on people of color) � Gangs (Why do they exist? How can they be transformed or eliminated?
VI Make the Document More User Friendly The ultimate users of the ESMC document are classroom teacher many of whom have little understanding of academic sociological vocabulary and whose time available to read the ESMC is limited. Suggested modifications:
A. Avoid jargon or at least define ambiguous terms. Some examples: "social consciousness" (Preface, page 6, line 48); "counter narrative" (Chapter 1, page 3, line 68); "agency," (Chapter 1, page 10, line 209); "holistic humanization" and "critical consciousness" (Chapter 1, page 12 lines 248-249); "Afro-futurism" (Chapter 3, page 20, line 486); "meta-cognitively" (Chapter 3, page 33, line 835).
B. Reduce the length of the document. Examples:
� "The History of Ethnic Studies". (Chapter 1, pages 6-7, lines 110-189). I doubt many teachers will be interested in knowing the history of the various ethnic studies confrontations at SFSU and UCB in the 60's. As an alternative to the current language I suggest the following summary: "In the late 1960's students at San Francisco State University and the University of California Berkeley confronted university administrators who opposed the establishment of ethnic studies academic departments; in the end, ethnic studies advocates prevailed and soon thereafter ethnic studies departments were established not only at SFSU and UCB but at other California universities and were established at other universities throughout the country." (Maintain lines 182-189 as part of the document)
� Christine Steeler's research is discussed in two sections of Chapter 1 and is somewhat repetitive. I recommend the two sections be combined and concisely summarized.
