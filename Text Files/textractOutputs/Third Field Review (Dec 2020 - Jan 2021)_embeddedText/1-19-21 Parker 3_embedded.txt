The new rules of the House of Representatives prevents it's members from using the words mother, father, son or daughter because these are not gender neutral designations. Besides being laughable aren't these rules a violation of free speech? This may seem minor compared to her efforts to squash the free speech of conservatives, but it represents the same ethos. ----- Forwarded Message ----From: American Retirement Insider To: "[email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021, 10:33:18 AM PST Subject: Pelosi Once Again Proves She Can't Follow Her Own Rules

Check out her recent violation of House rules.
