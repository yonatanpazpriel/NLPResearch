Dear California Department of Education, I would like to reinforce our community's demands and echo what has been said thus far. I request that you include the link to the IHRA definition of antisemitism in the glossary, so that educators have a clear understanding of how to teach the term. I also ask that you approve this BDS-free curriculum for all school districts, to be sure that no BDS or antisemitism will make its way into the curriculum during the finalization process. Just as I understand my responsibility as a parent to be aware and proactive about my child's education, I ask that you continue to act on your responsibility to produce an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states throughout the country that will follow in California's footsteps. Thank you
