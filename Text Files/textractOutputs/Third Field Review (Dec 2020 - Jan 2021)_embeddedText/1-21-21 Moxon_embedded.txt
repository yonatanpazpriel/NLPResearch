From: [email redacted] Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum objection
I hereby object to and oppose the Ethnic Studies curriculum. I will spare lengthy argument.
But it is wrong, immoral and extremely damaging to judge persons on the basis of their color or race. How can you logically say otherwise? It is utterly illogical to assert that children should be singled out and potentially vilified because of their skin color. And the proponents are against doing so for "black or brown" people, but are willing to do so for "whites." This is discrimination at is core.
I am "white" by your definitions. My paternal grandfather was a poor immigrant from England. My paternal grandmother's family was English and Welsh. They were poor but survived. They harmed no "black or brown" people. On my mother's side, her ancestors came to this country to escape religious persecution. They harmed no "black or brown" people.
My grandchildren are 1/4 Irish, and about 3/4 English, Welsh and German stock. They are to be singled out as part of an evil group because of their "race" or skin color under your program.
What is wrong with the purveyor's of this evil philosophy? No justification for it is logical. My grandchildren did nothing to deserve your censure or that of their classmates you seek to turn against them.
Have you no shame?
