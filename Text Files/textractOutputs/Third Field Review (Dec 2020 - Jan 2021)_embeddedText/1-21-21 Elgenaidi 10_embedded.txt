Introduction
In the last lesson, students learned about racism on an interpersonal level. This lesson considers the consequences of structural racism. Sometimes known as institutional or systemic racism, structural racism is defined as public policies and institutional practices that perpetuate racial group inequality.
In Lesson 9, students will examine the causes and effects of structural racism and explore white privilege as an integral part of structural racism. Through a PowerPoint presentation and Urban Institute article, students will analyze the widespread impact of structural racism on various groups. For homework, students will refine their understanding through independent research on a case study of their choice.

Background Information for Educators
Sometimes known as institutional or systemic racism, structural racism is defined as public policies and institutional practices that perpetuate racial group inequality.1 These policies advantage whites and harm people of color by creating a structured or institutionalized hierarchy in which whites have more access and opportunities.2
Examples of structural racism can be found from healthcare to housing to the criminal justice system.3 While some examples of structural racism are overt (public and obvious), others are covert (subtle and hidden). Think of segregation laws of the Jim Crow era. These laws publicly and explicitly discriminated against people of color.4 On the other hand, mass incarceration, which disproportionately targets people of color, has been masked as a necessary, neutral policy to ensure "Law and Order."5 The criminal justice system does not explicitly and openly discriminate against members of nonwhite groups, but the policies that have been put in place around drug offenses and other misdemeanor crimes are just as harmful as the impacts of segregation.
To understand structural racism, we must also understand its opposite: white privilege. White privilege is the inherent advantages possessed by a white person on the basis of their race. Because of discriminatory policies and institutional practices against people of color, white people have an inherent "leg up" in the United States and in many other parts of the world.6 White privilege allows white people to interact with the police without the fear of racial bias or violence, to have the upper hand in job opportunities, to have political and legal decision-makers overwhelmingly reflect their demographic, and to see themselves represented positively in the media they watch. On the other hand, structural racism makes all of these things inaccessible or impossible for many people of color.
Learning Objectives

Guiding Questions
1. What is structural racism and how does it impact people? 2. What is white privilege and how does it function? 3. What role do dominant narratives play in justifying structural racism and white privilege? 4. Does interpersonal racism reinforce structural racism? If so, how?
Key Concepts and Terminology
 Structural Racism - public policies and institutional practices, typically sanctioned by the government, that perpetuate racial group inequality.
 Institutionalization - the action of establishing something as a societal norm.  Discrimination - the unjust treatment of different groups of people, especially on the
grounds of race, age, or sex.  White Privilege - inherent advantages possessed by a white person on the basis of her or
his race.  Overt Racism - a form of racial discrimination that is public or obvious.  Covert Racism � a form of racial discrimination that is disguised or subtle.
In-Class Activities
1. The Hook - Show students the National Equity Project's graphic (page 8) that illustrates the cyclical relationship between implicit bias and structural racism. Ask students to write down answers to the following questions. Have students share their answers while you take notes on the board.  What do you see?  What do you wonder?

2. Main Activity - The main activity consists of a PowerPoint presentation and an independent reading exercise. First, present the ICSB slides 23 to 53 which introduce students to the concept of structural racism (starting page 10). Students will use the Cornell Notes Worksheet (page 9) to take notes during the presentation. During this presentation, students will apply concepts from previous lessons to understand how dominant narratives contribute to structural racism. After the presentation, ask students to independently read the Urban Institute article "To Talk about Structural Racism, We Have to Talk about White Privilege." This article introduces students to the concept of white privilege and the role it plays in structural racism. Students should highlight the main arguments and write two three key takeaways from the article.
3. Class Discussion - Divide the class into groups of 3 or 4 students. Ask students to reflect on the information they learned in the presentation and the article. Write the Discussion Questions (pages 5-6) on the board for students to discuss in their groups. Next, ask groups to brainstorm historical and/or contemporary examples of structural racism. Bring the class back together and compile a list of the examples each group came up with. If students are unfamiliar with some examples brought up by peers, pause to further discuss how structural racism plays a role in each example. Each student will choose one of these examples (or brainstorm another example that they are interested in) to conduct independent research on for homework.
4. Reflection - Ask students to revisit the graphic that they analyzed at the beginning of class. With their new understanding of structural racism, combined with their knowledge of implicit bias that they gained in Lesson 8, ask students to reflect on the meaning of the graphic. How has their understanding of it changed over the class period? Is there anything they are uncertain of or what to learn more about? You may also want to pose the lesson's Guiding Questions (page 4) to students to guide their reflection.
5. Extension Activities - Here are some ideas for further student exploration:  Students choose an example of modern structural racism and create an informational poster on the case to put up around the school or community to educate others.  Students review the Invisible Knapsack, which introduces students to the concept of privilege. If the class has a high trust level among students, you may want to use the "Privilege Walk" exercise.
Discussion Questions
1. How does structural racism differ from individual or interpersonal racism? 2. In what areas of life do people experience structural racism?
Copyright � 2021 ING. 3031 Tisch Way, 110 Plaza West, San Jose, CA 95128 | 408.296.7312 | mail@ing.org

6
3. How have various groups been impacted by structural racism? (Indigenous Peoples, African Americans, Latinx Americans, Asian Americans, Jewish Americans, Arab or Muslim Americans)
4. What is white privilege and how does it work? What are the effects of white privileges? 5. How are some examples of structural racism perceived as neutral policies? (Hint: Think
covert racism.). 6. What role do narratives play in justifying structural racism?
Homework
Option 1: Students choose an example of structural racism that was discussed in class. Students should conduct independent research on the case and create a presentation to give to the class. The presentation could be in the form of a PowerPoint, video, podcast, poster, comic, etc. You may also want to make this assignment a collaborative exercise by having students work in pairs or groups. Think about having students share their presentations with the wider community (school, city, etc).
Option 2: Students choose an example of systemic racism and create an informational poster on the case to put up around the school or community.

PowerPoint Presentation Slides
Slide 23: Structural Racism � While today people often focus on individual racism or bias, structural or institutional racism is often the larger problem. We will look at this factor next.
Slide 24: Structural/Institutional Racism � Internalization and implicit bias can create deep-rooted structures which are more pernicious than individual bias: structural or institutional racism. � "Institutional" or "structural racism" describes societal patterns that impose oppressive or negative conditions on racial or ethnic groups to the degree that it's difficult for any member of the targeted group to escape the impact of racism. � Unlike individual racism, institutional racism negatively affects people on a large scale. � In the US, structural racism has been responsible for such large scale atrocities as slavery, genocide against Native Americans, segregation, lynchings, and Japanese incarceration.
Slide 25: Structural/Institutional Racism � Structural racism continues today in diverse ways which work as a vicious cycle to keep certain groups excluded from privileges. � Minorities are often treated unequally in housing, education, employment, wealth accumulation, domestic and foreign policies, the criminal justice system, and healthcare. This creates a vicious cycle that perpetuates racial inequality. � Poorer neighborhoods have less security and lower quality food, health, and overall lifestyle options. Low-cost housing results in lower taxes, which means schools have less funding in poorer areas, leading to bigger classes and fewer resources, all of which result in higher drop-out rates and poorer education. This results in lower paying jobs and less wealth. � Biased domestic and foreign policies such as the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, ICE raids and deportations of undocumented people, and the Muslim Ban all have

adverse effects on these populations, as do biased systems such as racial profiling, a biased justice system, and lowquality healthcare delivery for people of color.
Slide 31: PART TWO: HOW STRUCTURAL RACISM MANIFESTS IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES
� We will now look at the various ways that racism manifests in different non-White communities both historically and today.
� While we focus on many of the major groups some of whom have similar trajectories, we are not able to talk about all communities during this short panel; even if a group is not included, we hope that you will see the patterns that are applicable to other groups.
� We also realize that some many people have multiple racial or ethnic backgrounds or identities and therefore might identity with more than one group; every person's experience will be slightly different.
� We also realize that bigotry stems from other sources such as gender or sexuality, but in this panel our focus is specifically on racism.
� Lastly, while we will highlight the challenges for each group, it is important to remember that people in all these groups have accomplished incredible achievements in education and work.
Slide 32: Facilitator asks students to take notes on the various forms of racism that affect each group for follow-up discussion
Slide 33: Structural Racism Against Indigenous Peoples � Indigenous People � the original residents of the land we all occupy today � have suffered from continuous warfare, displacement, and oppression since 1492. � Since the arrival of Europeans they have been subjected to ongoing violence, killings, and massacres of entire tribes, both by the federal government and by settler-colonialists. � The view of them as backward savages in need of "civilizing" and of salvation through conversion to Christianity was used to justify their enslavement and forced conversion to Christianity both by Spanish Catholics

through missions and other means, as well as by English Protestants. � Unfamiliar diseases spread by Europeans infected and decimated entire tribes. � Tribes gave up huge swaths of land to the federal government based on treaties promising that the government would protect the tribes as sovereign entities with rights to self-governance. Yet the government repeatedly violated or broke its treaties, including around 370 treaties which were never entirely honored, a problem which continues today.7 � The United States acquired much of its land through these failed treaties; the maps on the slide show the continuous takeover of Indigenous land which continues to the present. � Federal recognition means the US government recognizes the right of some tribes to exist as a sovereign entity with the right to tribal self-government in internal affairs, whereas non-recognized tribes can form tribal organizations but lack sovereign powers. � Christian boarding schools were established in the 19th century as a tool to "assimilate" tribal children into the "American way of life." � It wasn't until 1924, when Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act, that citizenship was granted to all Indigenous Peoples born in the U.S. However, the right to vote was governed by state law, and some states barred Native Americans from voting until 1957.
Slide 34: Structural Racism Against Indigenous Peoples � The Doctrine of Discovery refers to the spiritual, political, and legal justifications for the colonization and seizure of land not inhabited by Christians. In an 1823 US Supreme Court case Chief Justice John Marshall cited the "Doctrine of Discovery" in the unanimous decision to dispossess Indigenous Peoples: "The principle of discovery gave European nations an absolute right to New World lands."8 � Following the US purchase of the Louisiana Territory from France in 1803, Whites desiring to settle these new lands pressured the government to get rid of its Indigenous inhabitants. � The Indian Removal Act signed by President Andrew Jackson in 1830 authorized the President to negotiate with tribes in the southeastern US for their removal to

federal territory west of the Mississippi River. While a few tribes went peacefully, many resisted the relocation policy. � This resulted in a series of forced relocations of tens of thousands of Indigenous People by the US government between 1830 and 1850. � These forced relocations, during which tens of thousands of men, women, and children were forced to march hundreds of miles in harsh conditions, is referred to as the "Trail of Tears," since thousands died on the way due to hunger, disease, cold, and exhaustion. � This history explains why most reservations are located west of the Mississippi.
Slide 35: Structural Racism Against Indigenous Peoples � While there is no agreed-upon estimate of the total population of Indigenous Peoples before European colonization, we know that they made up 100% of the population of the Americas. � Today they make up less than 2% (4 to 6 million.) of the total US population (330 million). � There are 574 federally recognized tribal nations in the US9 and over 100 in California.10 � Reservations are still subject to state or corporate interests. � This has resulted in displacement of Indigenous Peoples from reservation lands that contain desirable resources. � Inhabitants of reservations are also among the most frequent victims of ecological racism with environmentally destructive industrial and mining projects encroaching on their lands, continuing the cycle of land appropriation in a new form. For example, over 600,000 Indigenous People live within 10 km. of an abandoned mine.11 � A recent project that has been challenged by Indigenous People is the Dakota pipeline which threatens crucial water resources and runs through their sacred land. � Reservations also face a multitude of serious challenges. � They include deep poverty, malnutrition, lack of water and good soil, low quality healthcare, and education, to name a few. � For these and other reasons young people are leaving reservations in search of greater opportunities and a better life; the majority (78%) of Indigenous Peoples do not live

Slide 36: Structural Racism Against Indigenous Peoples � Today Indigenous Peoples are disadvantaged in every sector of life and society. � 17% of Indigenous students attend college compared to 60% of the general population.14 � They have high levels of unemployment and the highest poverty rate (25%) of any group.15 � Large percentages suffer from huge health disparities and food insecurity. � Nearly 29% of those under the age of 65 lack health insurance.16 � They have a nearly 50% higher death rate than whites due to chronic illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, chronic liver disease, and diabetes.17 � They have the highest number of COVID-19 hospitalizations of any group, with 2.8 times more cases than whites and 5.3 times more hospitalizations than whites.18 � Their history and perspectives are often erased or misrepresented in popular culture. � This includes biased, one-sided, or missing history in history textbooks and curriculum. � The focus in education has generally been on wars between tribes and the federal government, often written from the government's or white man's perspective. � The media focuses on stories relating to poverty, mascots, or casinos. � It has more recently focused on the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota pipeline or, more recently, opposition to

the carvings on Mt. Rushmore. It is rare to see stories of normal people commenting on general issues. � Hollywood also has a long history of representing Indigenous People in stereotypical ways. � Men have long played warriors involved in endless battles; or the opposite � victims, drunks, or strangely spiritual medicine men. � Women have been portrayed as princesses, the object of romance. Probably the most well-known Hollywood character is Pocahontas, who represents the "good Native" who helps whites and even falls in love with them, thereby demonstrating her adoption of their "superior" culture.
Slide 37: Structural Racism Against African Americans � The transatlantic slave trade which transported 10 to 12 million enslaved Africans to the Americas between the 16th to the 19th century was based on a view of Africans as subhuman. � The long and horrific history of slavery is characterized by the dehumanization of African Americans as the basis for both the institution and their often brutal treatment with all of its painful details. � In 1865, the 13th Amendment finally abolished slavery in the United States, although conditions for African Americans remained oppressive. � The 14th Amendment, which was ratified in 1868, granted citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States--including former slaves--and guaranteed all citizens "equal protection of the laws." � Yet these new laws were soon challenged by "Jim Crow" laws on the state and local level that mandated segregation in public facilities between 1876 and 1965. � This led to separate and unequal treatment across all major institutions that disadvantaged African Americans for decades. � This segregation was accompanied by anti-Black intimidation, violence, and killings by groups like the KKK, especially against those who dared to challenge the status quo. � Years of protests by African Americans and their allies during the Civil Rights Movement in the 1950s and early 1960s finally resulted in passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and other areas.

Slide 38: Structural Racism Against African Americans � While more than 50 years after the passage of the 1964 Civil Right Act there have been many milestones to celebrate, such as the election of the first Black president, African Americans continue to suffer from racial biases, discrimination, inequalities, and structural racism across multiple institutions. � Housing discrimination and segregation persist in American neighborhoods and cities. � Redlining (refusing a home loan to someone because they live in an area deemed to be a poor financial risk), which started in the 1930s and operated in the nation's largest cities, prevented African Americans from owning their own homes. It also forced them to live in low-income government housing and led to the rise of slums. � Housing discrimination - whether due to mortgage or rental bias - leads to poor quality housing and neighborhoods and disadvantages residents in every aspect of life. � This in turn creates health disparities. � Poor neighborhoods often have less security and more stressors than more affluent ones, leading to higher levels of stress in both parents and children relating to personal safety and that of one's family.19 � The quality of food is often poor due to "food deserts," areas with limited access to fresh produce and healthy options, usually in impoverished neighborhoods. � All these factors, as well as environmental pollution, which is often higher in poor areas, lead to health disparities, which are compounded by bias in the healthcare system. � The Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted African American communities; they have 2.6 times more cases and 4.7 times more hospitalizations than whites.20 � Low-income housing and neighborhoods result in disparities in education. � Low-cost housing results in lower taxes, less school funding, and lower quality schools, education, and opportunities for African American students. � Additionally, African American students are often the targets of biased teachers or staff.

Slide 39: Structural Racism Against African Americans � Many factors contribute to a biased policing and criminal justice system. � The "school to prison pipeline" is a well-documented process of criminalizing youth through disciplinary policies and practices in schools that often push students into the juvenile and criminal justice systems. � While African American students represent only 16% of the total public school population, they receive 42% of the suspensions and expulsions;21 African American boys are suspended three times more often than white boys and African American girls are suspended six times more often than white girls.22 � African American students receiving such treatment are then three times more likely to be subjected to the juvenile justice system the following year.23 � Racial profiling in policing,24 a biased justice system, and the "War on Drugs" which disproportionately targets people of color, especially African Americans, have resulted in a disproportionate percentage of African Americans in prison. � In the criminal justice system overall, African Americans are incarcerated at five times the rate of whites.25 � While they make up only 12 to 13% of the population, African Americans make up 37% of incarcerated people26 and receive nearly 20% longer sentences than whites for similar crimes.27 � In recent year the Black Lives Matter movement has highlighted the persistent problem of police killings of African Americans.

Slide 40: Structural Racism Against African Americans � African Americans also suffer from employment, income, and wealth inequalities. � African American unemployment is twice as high as white unemployment, even for college graduates.28 This is in part due to bias in hiring and promotion. � In 2018, median African American wages were 73.3 percent of white wages.29 � The median wealth for African American families in 2016 was 10% of white families' ($17,600 compared with white families' median wealth of $171,000).30 � In education, racism includes inaccurate or stereotypical portrayals as well as the erasure of their history, perspectives, and contributions from textbooks. � There is a lack of curriculum and literature that center Black voices. � Additionally, there is often a vilification of historical Black figures. � The media often focus on news that centers on violence, crime, and poverty, but fails to discuss systemic barriers facing African Americans. � One-sided media coverage can lead to negative attitudes and greater support for harsher punishments in the criminal justice system. � Negative depictions can also affect African-American's selfperceptions and self-esteem.31 � Hollywood depictions of African Americans often involve one-dimensional characters and stories. � They often are cast in stereotypical roles as gangsters or bad guys. � There is also a lack of significant creative control by Black executive producers and writers.

Slide 41: Structural Racism Against Latinx � The term Latinx includes people from countries in various regions of Latin America, including Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. � It encompasses a mixture of races including Black, Indigenous People, and whites of Spanish origin. � There are around 60 million people of Latinx origin in the US.32 They make up about 18% of the population33 with major concentrations in the Southwest and California. � Mexican Americans are the largest group, around 37 million people.34 � Yet they have long been viewed as foreigners and invaders, a perception which impacts treatment and policies towards all Latinx. � After the US won the Mexican-American War in 1848, there was a rise in lynchings and other vigilante-style violence in the West/Southwest from 1848 to 1928. � The rise in unemployment during the Great Depression combined with anti-Mexican sentiment led to the Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s, a mass deportation of up to 2 million people, an estimated 60% of whom were US citizens.35 � Like Jim Crow laws, "Juan Crow" laws in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the Southwestern US included the denial of service to Mexican Americans by restaurants and other businesses. � Anti-Mexican racism fueled yet another mass deportation of thousands of Mexicans in 1954 referred to "Operation Wetback."36
Slide 42: Structural Racism Against Latinx � The US has long viewed Latin America as part of its sphere of influence and, especially during the Cold War (1947� 1991), was in direct competition with the Soviet Union for influence in the region. For these and other reasons, such as access to resources, the US has intervened in a number of Latin American countries.

� These have included direct, covert, and proxy interventions in countries such as Cuba, Guyana, Chile, Nicaragua, and the Dominican Republic, to name a few. These interventions have numerous ramifications, including contributing to the unrest that often leads to mass migration.
� Puerto Ricans are the second largest Latinx group in the US, numbering close to 6 million.37
� Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the US located in the Caribbean. Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the US since 1917 with free access to the mainland.
� The governor represents them, and they pay taxes like other American citizens, yet they are not allowed to vote unless they live on the mainland.
� Additionally, they are consistently seen as "Other," and Puerto Rico is not treated like other parts of the United States, as was evidenced by the actions and statements of President Trump during the 2017 hurricane.
� Current immigration policies towards all these groups echo past rhetoric and fear-mongering about a "Hispanic invasion."
� These include ICE raids, detentions, and deportations, which create fear in these communities.
� It has also led to border policies such as the indefinite mass detention of immigrants at our borders in often inhumane conditions.
� Latinx families have been ripped apart through detentions both inside the US and at the border. The separation of children from their parents has created deep trauma and suffering, in violation of accepted human rights. In fact, lawyers have not been able to locate the parents of over five hundred children.38
Slide 43: Structural Racism Against Latinx � Like African Americans, Latinx are also disproportionately impacted by a biased law enforcement and criminal justice system. � Latinx make up 23% of prison inmates despite being only 16% of the adult population.39

� As with African Americans, this is in part due to racial profiling and the "War on Drugs," which targets people of color.
� With the increase in private prisons and detention centers has come the policy of heavy policing in communities of color to fill these prisons.
� Latinx are also subject to income, housing, and healthcare inequalities.
� The Latinx-white wage gap for full time employees has been 15% for men and 33% for women for decades.40
� In 2016 the median net worth for a Hispanic family was $20,720.41
� As with African Americans, poor quality housing and neighborhoods disadvantage Latinx in every aspect of life.
� This includes health and healthcare disparities. � Latinx have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or
ethnic group in the US.42 � Due to this and to underlying health issues, larger presence
as frontline workers, and other factors, Latinx are hospitalized from COVID-19 at a rate 4x that of whites.43
Slide 44: Structural Racism Against Latinx � Like other minorities, Latinx also suffer from discriminatory policies in education, including the fact that cheap housing means lower taxes and therefore lowerquality schools and education. � As with other groups, Latinx history and perspectives are often erased from textbooks or are biased or inaccurate. � Ethnic studies classes, which are an antidote to one-sided perspectives, are often the object of protest or targeted for removal. � Latinx students are often encouraged to attend trade school instead of college. � Students with Spanish names, even if they are fluent in English, sometimes get placed in ESL classes. � Popular culture also perpetuates stereotypes about Latinx. � The media focus on stories relating to border security and "illegal immigrants."

� Hollywood portrays Latinas as sultry and feisty, such as the character Gloria Delgado-Pritchett in the show Modern Family, or as maids, as in Maid in Manhattan. Latinos are portrayed as either lazy, dashing lovers, criminals, or gardeners.
� Today Latinx groups are once again facing rising prejudice and discrimination.
� According to a 2018 report by Pew, a majority (54%) of people surveyed say it has become more difficult in recent years to be Hispanic in the U.S. and 38% experienced some type of discrimination in the past year.44
� These incidents include being criticized for speaking Spanish in public, being told to go back to their home country, or being called offensive names.
� This hate has even lead to extremist mass shootings targeting Latinx in Gilroy, California and El Paso, Texas in 2019.
Slide 45: Structural Racism Against Asian Americans � Asian immigration to the US is generally divided into two periods: pre-1965 and post-1965 � The first major wave of Asians were Chinese who were recruited primarily as laborers during the California Gold Rush, which began in 1848. � As their numbers grew, they faced increasing prejudice, discrimination, and animosity. � Viewed as "unassimilable," they were not allowed to become part of mainstream society or to live in certain places. � Anti-Chinese animus lead to the passage of a number of anti-Asian policies. � One of the first was the Foreign Miner's Act of 1850, which required miners who were not US citizens to pay a tax of $20 a month in an attempt to exclude Chinese and other non-White miners. � The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act prohibited immigration of all Chinese laborers to the US. � The Act also excluded Chinese immigrants already settled in the US from eligibility for citizenship. � This was the first immigration law to exclude an entire ethnic group.

Slide 46: Structural Racism Against Asian Americans � New waves of Asians began immigrating to the US in the late 19th and early 20th century. � They included Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos who were recruited to replace Chinese labor. � Eventually the 1924 Immigration Act banned all Asians from migrating to the US. � The 1934 Tydings�McDuffie Act reclassified Filipinos as aliens and established a quota of only 50 immigrants per year. � The 1943 Magnuson Act finally repealed the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act but restricted Chinese immigrants to only 105 new entry visas annually. � Anti-Japanese hostility and prejudice contributed to public acceptance of the internment of some 120,000 Americans of Japanese origin during World War II.
Slide 47: Structural Racism Against Asian Americans � It was not until the 1965 Immigration Act was passed that the quota system was abolished and immigration became more inclusive of Asians and other non-Europeans. � The new policy favored educated professionals for immigration to the US, including physicians, nurses, scientists, engineers, etc., or those studying in those fields. � Over the next few decades Asian Americans went from "unassimilable" to "exceptional" in their achievements in education, professional advancement, and acquisition of wealth and status in society. (Today they number around 18 million, about 6 percent of the U.S. population. ChineseAmericans are the largest sub-group with around 4.3 million people, followed by 4 million Indian-Americans 3 million Filipino-Americans.)45 � They are heralded as a "model minority" and held up as an example to other minority groups. � Asian Americans are better educated than the general US population and are overrepresented at elite universities, although that is not the case for all the 20 countries of origin included in the category of Asian American. � This creates a racial hierarchy that divides different minority communities. � Attitudes shaped by this fact are also internalized by newer immigrants; for example, a 2014 lawsuit of Chinese and Indian Americans against Harvard claimed that factoring in

race for affirmative action hurts Asian Americans. This pits this "model minority" against other minorities and doesn't accurately reflect all the group's members.
Slide 48: Structural Racism Against Asian Americans � Yet in reality the citizenship of Asian Americans is still "fragile" because, despite all their successes, they still face continued prejudice and racism. � Old and new stereotypes are reinforced in popular culture. � Hollywood often circulates the same stereotypical representations, such as dragon lady, Kung Fu fighters, or passive and submissive Asian women. � The film Mulan breaks some stereotypes but reinforces others relating to gender roles, including the view that Asians only value women for their role in marriage. � Stereotypes and bigotry resurface when society experiences problems. � The COVID-19 pandemic was blamed on the Chinese, which has led to racism and bigotry on social media, as well as racist slurs and even physical attacks on Asian Americans.
Slide 49: Structural Racism Against Jewish Americans � Anti-Semitism, which refers to prejudice and/or discrimination against Jews both as individuals and as a group, initially focused on religious differences between Jews and Christians and was rooted in Christian supremacy. � Anti-Semitism has a long history in Europe. � In 1095 crusaders en route to fight Muslims looted and massacred Jewish communities and raped their women, an event that marked a serious intensification of anti-Jewish oppression and violence. � From the 13th century onwards Jews were subjected to political, economic, and social discrimination and deprived of both legal and civil rights. � They were restricted to living in ghettos and required to wear a distinctive symbol identifying them as Jews. � In the mid-14th century Jews were blamed for Bubonic Plague, and in Germany and Austria some 100,000 Jews were burned alive for these and other false accusations, including charges that Jews used blood of Christian boys to make Passover matza and that they desecrated sacramental wafers. � From 1881 to 1921 waves of pogroms destroyed hundreds of European Jewish communities and resulted in the murder of some 60,000 Jews.

� Anti-Semitism peaked in the US in the 20th century between the two world wars.
� Jews were restricted from living in certain neighborhoods or working in some professions.
� Jews were also blamed for starting World War I, causing the Great Depression, and even for being behind the "New Deal," which was mockingly referred to as the "Jew Deal."
� The Holocaust during World War resulted in the systematic murder of six million Jews.
� Anti-Semitism not only muted the American response to Jewish suffering but also limited immigration of Jewish refugees fleeing persecution.
Slide 50: Structural Racism Against Jewish Americans � Anti-Semitism is a core ideology of current white nationalist/white supremacy movements in the US. � The 2017 Charlottesville rally featured swastikas and chants of "Jews will not replace us." � There has been a spike in anti-Semitism since 2016 that is often linked to anti-immigrant sentiment. It has resulted in the bullying of Jewish students, vandalism at synagogues, desecration of Jewish cemeteries, and street attacks on visibly identifiable Jews. � Anti-Semitic hate has turned lethal recently with mass shootings at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 and the Chabad of Poway Synagogue in San Diego in 2019.
Slide 51: Structural Racism Against Jewish Americans � In popular culture Jews are often portrayed as a monolithic ethnic or racial group, failing to acknowledge the diversity of Jews in race and ethnicity and in education and financial status. � Jews are often stereotyped and demonized on social media as puppeteers with global wealth and power. � They have even been blamed for global events, including COVID-19, as illustrated by this post from social media shortly after the outbreak of the pandemic. � The film The Passion of the Christ by Mel Gibson has been criticized for blaming the Jews for the killing of Jesus. � Education also has its share of anti-Semitic sources. � Literature with anti-Semitic representations that is often read in school or college includes Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens, in which the evil character Fagin is graphically represented as a Jew, and The Sun Also Rises by Ernest

Hemingway, in which the character Robert Cohn is referred to as a "kike" by other characters.
Slide 52: Structural Racism Against Muslim Americans � Muslims were long viewed as the enemy of Europe and Christendom. Hostility towards Muslims both as nonChristian "infidels" and as a geo-political rival and threat surfaced in various episodes of history. � The various Crusades during the Middle Ages, in which European Catholics attempted to take control of Jerusalem, were responsible for the destruction and death of tens of thousands of Muslims and of many non-Catholic Christians and Jews. � The Spanish Inquisition following the fall of the last Muslim stronghold of Granada in 1492 was another extreme episode of religious persecution of Spanish Muslims and Jews marked by violence, forced conversions, and expulsions. � Ongoing conflicts with the Ottoman Empire over land and control cast the Turks as the enemy for centuries until the end of the empire in 1924. � As previously discussed, colonialism led to Orientalism, which began as the study of North Africa and the Middle East in the 19th century. � Orientalism portrayed Muslims as exotic, primitive, sexist, and violent, to be both feared and vilified. � In the US Muslims were viewed as "the enemy" even before 9/11. � One of the first episodes to highlight this enmity was the oil embargo in the 1970s after OPEC countries � mostly Arab Muslims � raised the price of oil and were demonized in the government and popular culture as greedy "sheiks." � The Iran hostage crisis which followed the 1979 Iranian Revolution, during which a group of pro-revolution Iranian students held American diplomats and citizens hostage for 444 days, and the revolution itself, characterized as Islamic, with its images of angry Iranian Muslims burning American flags, were seared into the American conscience as the face of Islam and Muslims, with little context given for the background of the revolution and of anti-American sentiment that was rooted in US support for the despotic Shah and other policies. � Despite the role of the Afghani mujahedeen as American allies against the Soviets, after the fall of Communism and the end of the Cold War which had dominated American

foreign policy for decades, Muslims came to be viewed as the new threat and enemy. � Since 9/11, Muslims have been viewed as the most dangerous enemy, despite recent reports that white supremacist groups are a greater threat domestically. This perspective has impacted policies, perceptions, and treatment of Muslim Americans for nearly two decades. � "The "War on Terror," which refers to the international campaign against Muslim terrorist groups after 9/11, casts all Muslims as a security threat, resulting in such policies as the racial profiling and surveillance of Muslims. � Rising Islamophobia has resulted in a spike in anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate crimes, increased bullying of Muslim students, and mosque vandalism and arsons across the country.
Slide 53: Structural Racism Against Muslim Americans � Since education about Islam and Muslims only became part of school curriculum in recent decades, public schools generally provided little or no education about Muslims and their history, and what they did provide was often inaccurate, incomplete, and even biased. � Curriculum about Muslim history has often been filtered through a Eurocentric lens that overlooks Muslim contributions, makes Muslim achievements secondary to European accomplishments, or casts Muslims as the enemy.46 Curriculum about contemporary Muslim societies often reaffirms mainstream views that Muslims are antiquated, misogynistic, and incapable of embracing modernity. � A 2019 poll in California found that Muslim students are almost twice as likely to face bullying at school, with 40% reporting being bullied; nearly a third of Muslim students reported that school staff made derogatory statements about Muslims or Islam.47 � Popular culture: � According to media content analysis, more than 80 percent of television media coverage of Islam and Muslims in the United States is negative,48 and coverage of Muslims is the most negative of reportage on minority groups, mainly due
46 A 2014 study by Lehigh University researcher Alexander Wiseman, who reviewed 72 textbooks from 15 Western countries for content relating to Islam, found that "content related to contemporary Islam and Arab societies in Western secondary-level textbooks is overwhelmingly related to terrorism and terrorists" and to regional conflicts. https://www.newsweek.com/cair-islamophobic-bullying-report-2019-1465490 47 https://ca.cair.com/sacval/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/Anti-Bully-Report_2019.pdf?x62983 48 https://www.ispu.org/journalists/

to reporting centered on foreign conflict zones.49 Additionally, terror attacks by Muslims get 357 percent more media coverage than other terror attacks,50 and acts of violence are generally labeled terrorism only when committed by Muslims. � Hollywood has consistently cast Muslims as villains and bad guys since the beginning of the motion picture industry. � The internet and social media spread Islamophobia through websites and posts. � Books, both fiction and non-fiction, especially post-9/11, are often Islamophobic and represent Muslims as violent and misogynistic, along with other stereotypes. � Video games often cast Muslims as terrorists or bad guys.
Slide 54: Structural Racism Against Muslim Americans � Domestic and foreign policy: � The US Patriot Act passed after 9/11 gave law enforcement expanded power to engage in wiretapping and other surveillance such as searching telephone, e-mail, financial records, and even library records. � Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan targeted Muslim-populated nations and peoples, resulting in massive destruction and the killing of thousands of innocent civilians. � Anti-Sharia legislation, which has been proposed or passed in 43 states across the country, claims to bar foreign laws in conflict with constitutional or state rights. Since the constitution already provides for this, critics see these campaigns as a guise for fomenting anti-Muslim sentiment.51 � The Travel Ban in 2017 prevents immigration or travel to America mainly from Muslim-majority nations. � American foreign policy and media coverage of these stories often show disregard for human rights violations against millions of Muslims in places such as China, Myanmar, Syria, Yemen, Kashmir, and Palestine. � Government surveillance and profiling: � Wiretapping by the FBI or racial profiling by the TSA singled out Muslim Americans following 9/11. � The NYPD's secret surveillance of Muslims failed to provide a single lead about terrorists.52
