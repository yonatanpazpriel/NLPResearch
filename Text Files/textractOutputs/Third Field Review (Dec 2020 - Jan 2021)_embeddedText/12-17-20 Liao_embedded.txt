Dear who may concern,
All Americans have equal human rights. However, I don't agree to emphasize the racism history. This will separate our unity and our community that we have work on for a long time.
Don't educate our next generation to hate each other by using this critical ethnic materials in the school.
This critical ethnic study in California public school is racist.
Sincerely, Annette Liao
