Let me start with an analogy. A contractor builds a brick house with a defective mortar and in a short time the house falls apart. The same contractor builds a slightly smaller house with the same defective mortar. Again the house is in ruins. Third time the same contractor builds a much larger house with the same defective mortar and the result is the same failure. Likewise, the three ESMC editions are based on the same Values and Principles, rooted in the Critical Consciousness, Critical Race Theory, and Critical Ethnic Studies, all richly laced with the historically proven as defective Marxism-leaning ideology. But there is an abundance of opposition to the Critical warriors claiming that theirs is the only right approach to Ethnic Studies and who with no compunction call their opponents racists and fascists. And there are multicultural educators who prefer unbiased constructive teaching of the Ethnic Studies discipline. What is needed now is a fresh look into the Ethnic Studies that can incorporate different viewpoints illustrating both "bad" and "good" facts of American history, with the eventual prevalence of the "good" which has attracted people from all over the world to America. Instead of the divisive and confrontational Values and Principles derived from the Critical stuff, the new well-balanced ESMC should be inclusive and build on a foundation of common goals and common sense.
