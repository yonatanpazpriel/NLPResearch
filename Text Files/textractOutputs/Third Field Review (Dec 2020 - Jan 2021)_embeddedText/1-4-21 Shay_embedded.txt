From: Henry D. (Hank) Shay Sent: Saturday, January 2, 2021 1:44 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
We are writing you to comment on the development of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
We would like to express our approbation of the changes now included in the third draft. We understand that it now contains two lesson plans on Jewish Americans, lessons 40 and 41, and we hope that the final version will continue to do so.
We suggest that the final version also include the Antidefamation League's "BINAH" lesson which deals with the problems presented to society by any form of ethnic or racial hatred.
We hope that the final Ethnic Studies course will stress "core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" as indicated in the California Education Code.
We applaud the rejection of an earlier version as incorporated in AB331 and endorse the passage of the revision AB101, introduced within the last month by Assemblymember Josï¿½ Medina.
Sincerely, Henry D. & Ernestina M. Shay
