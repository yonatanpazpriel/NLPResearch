The Honorable Tony Thurmond Superintendent of Public Instruction 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814 Dear Superintendent Thurmond:
This past February, the California Asian Pacific Legislative Caucus and I hosted a Day of Remembrance ceremony at the California Museum to reflect upon the incarceration of Japanese Americans in concentration camps during World War II. As part of this event, we screened a PBS documentary "Norman Mineta and His Legacy: An American Story".
Since the viewing, the producers have been able to make available a free, web-based educational tool that includes both the documentary and a curriculum guide. Developed at Stanford University, the curriculum, "What Does It Mean To Be An American" is comprised of six modules: immigration, civil liberties & equity, civic engagement, leadership, justice & reconciliation, and U.S.-Japan Relations.
This program was widely viewed throughout the country and it addresses key issues such as the Japanese American incarceration and redress movement in ways that are relevant to current-day issues. The program includes stories such as the profile of a college-age Vietnamese American student who has become politically active as part of the lesson on Civic Engagement. In the midst of the Black Lives Matters reckoning, students can hear directly from four young Black men who talk about the challenges and racism they face too frequently. You may view these profiles at the following website: https://www.whatdoesitmeantobeanamerican.com/
I think you will agree that this free, web-based educational tool is like nothing you've seen before. You can attribute the pedagogy and scholarly approach to the Stanford Program on International and Cross-Cultural Education (SPICE), but the 200 images and 23 videos are the result of this efforts web and production team, targeting primarily high school and college students.
I respectfully request that this high quality, educational product be included on the CDE's Curriculum Frameworks and Instructional Resources component of its website and shared announcing this free resource to schools. It should also be identified as a resource in the K-12 ethnic studies model curriculum that is currently in development.
Unfortunately, the issues are not new but they remain timely and relevant, perhaps more so now than ever. I look forward to work with you on this effort.
Sincerely,
