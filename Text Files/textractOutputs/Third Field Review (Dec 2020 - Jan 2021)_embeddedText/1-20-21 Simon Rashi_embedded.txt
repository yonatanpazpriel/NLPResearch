From: Rabbi Rashi Simon Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 1:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] State-sponsored racism in California
Dear Sir/Madam
ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM
I was dismayed recently to learn that the proposed above-mentioned curriculum contains antiSemitic canards. Rather than refute or discredit racist ideas, this curriculum perpetuates and indeed endorses them. I would go so far as to say that it even breaks new ground in uniquely associating Jewishness with privilege--a novel and pernicious canard which is surely gall and wormwood to those who suffered the most heinous persecution in Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia and elsewhere, still within living memory.
I will not rehearse the examples of this which have been expertly exposed by scholars, and have no doubt been brought to your attention. I come to simply add my voice to those anti-racism champions who have raised the alarm about this toxic, dangerous and offensive message.
I would be grateful to learn of your thoughts and intentions in this regard.
Yours Faithfully
