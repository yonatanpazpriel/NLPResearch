From: Greg Andrews Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:55 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] NO to Critical Race Studies
To Whom it May Concern:
We DON'T need critical race studies in our schools. What we do need is more of the Basics...Reading, Writing and Arithmetic. So, how about teaching the kids cursive handwriting again? Huh?
Please look at this link:
A Marxist Response to Critical Race Theory in Education https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.2304/power.2009.1.1.111
And please let me know you received my email.
Thanks
Greg Andrews
