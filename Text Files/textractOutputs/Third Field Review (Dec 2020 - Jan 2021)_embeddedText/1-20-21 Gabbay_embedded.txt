As the child of Holocaust survivors and a long time resident of California, I am outraged that there should be any public school curriculum in the United States of America....Which associates Jews with white privilege or any type of privilege.. Which of the context of today is always a negative connotation.
Even though Jews -whatever their skin color- are excluded/ discriminated against/subjected to prejudiced and racist behavior, misguided politicians and educators have decided to continue to perpetuate and spread -rather than educate and correct -falsehoods and libelous accusations that have caused Jews to suffer throughout history, including my parents grandparents, and so many more.
Are you trying to drive Your Jewish citizens out from the state of California....following in the footsteps of other governments in the past?
I know I certainly would not want my grandchildren to be singled out and falsely characterized or Mischaracterized in that way in their own school, which is supposed to be a safe zone. It Seems that instead you are trying to cause more division.
Please reconsider and reflect very strongly on what your goals and intentions are, and what the ramifications of these dangerous ideas might be.
