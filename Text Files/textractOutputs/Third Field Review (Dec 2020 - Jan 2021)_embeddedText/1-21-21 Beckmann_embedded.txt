From: JOHN BECKMANN Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 7:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic curriculum
The proposed ethnic studies curriculum, with it's blatant criticism of Jewish Americans, is a travesty in its promotion of anti semitism. One of many examples, Jews are criticized in this curriculum for sometimes Americanizing their last names, as if that was something shameful. Perhaps they did this to fit in (God forbid), or to avoid the pervasive discrimination in jobs, college admission, housing that they faced. Perhaps they did it because a name like Green was easier to pronounce than Gruenstein. Perhaps they didn't even chose do it, but the name change was imposed upon them on arrival at Ellis Island, which so often was the case. But most villainously in the view of this horrendous ethnic curriculum, perhaps they changed their names to feel more American! I beseech you to view this curriculum what it is : a treacherous effort to tear apart the fabric of American society and to particularly implicate Jews as villains. Please reject this outrage from becoming ingrained in the minds of California students.
