From: [email redacted] Sent: Sunday, January 3, 2021 1:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Lawrence Feinberg Subject: [EXTERNAL] Third Draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Thank you for including lessons on AntiSemitism in the current proposed curriculum (lessons 40 & 41), and listing AntiSemitism as a form of hate that all Californians need to be aware of.
It is important that the curriculum development process be transparent and incorporate input from all the public to avoid courses that create more hate rather than less.
The courses must teach that prejudice against any ethnicity, religion or sexual identity is equally wrong, not only prejudice against those groups championed by some professors.
To meet Califonria's needs, and to be fair and just, an Ethnic Studies course must be based on the "core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" ( per Education Code section 51226.7)
Sincerely, Lawrence Feinberg
