Do NOT implement evil leftist, socialist "Critical Race Theory" propaganda garbage programs in our California public schools! As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King correctly taught-"We are all only ONE RACE-- the HUMAN RACE!"
Close your evil ATHEIST, leftist, socialist political propaganda books--- and open up your Bibles! Follow Christ's teachings, to love God and your fellowman, like King, Gandhi, St. Mother Teresa, and many others! That is the ONLY way! And you know-- other religions, like Buddhism, Judaism, etc -- taught the same thing! Linda Bellavia
