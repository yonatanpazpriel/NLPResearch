My name is Howard Bucey. I'm a retired teacher who taught 5th and 6th grade students for 38 years. I would like to express my thoughts on the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. It is more important now than ever before for students to know the truth. A curriculum that emphasizes the negative aspects of our country and downplays the positives is doing a disservice to students. America is a great country, the best on earth. There have been injustices which students should be aware of but these injustices are only a small part of the story. Americans have strove through legislation, laws and even non-violent demonstrations to right wrongs. We can't leave future generations blind to the goodness in our country. The curriculum must be made to reflect the light that has brought so many from less fortunate circumstance around the world to the United States, and California in particular, creating a diverse and vibrant citizenry. Our founding fathers were human and made decisions based on the values in their time. We cannot judge them based on today's values and trends. Students need to be taught to realize this and judge their actions accordingly. I hope the curriculum will emphasize the positives we share and those qualities that make America great while learning there are productive ways to right the wrongs that exist.
Sincerely, Howard Bucey
