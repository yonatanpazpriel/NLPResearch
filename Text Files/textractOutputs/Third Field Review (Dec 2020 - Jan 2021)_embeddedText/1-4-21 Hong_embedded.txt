From: Karen Hong Sent: Monday, January 4, 2021 4:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public comments on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Most young people only learn about America in the classroom. It is important that they learn about the good things about America as well as the bad.
Students should know the ugly things that have happened, but they should also be taught of the ways America has and will continue to overcome injustice. It is NOT good to be taught to hate their country, which is the best the world has to offer.
They should not be taught that America is a racist country in which ethnic minorities cannot possibly succeed, which is NOT true. Instead of focusing only on the bad things that have happened in America, students should be taught that no matter who they are, they are free to do anything they set their heart on and should be encouraged toward that goal.
Sincerely,
Karen Hong [address redacted] West Covina, CA
