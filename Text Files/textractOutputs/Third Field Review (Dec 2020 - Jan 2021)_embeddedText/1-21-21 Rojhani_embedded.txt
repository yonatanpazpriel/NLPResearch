Hello -
I write in response to the proposed new curriculum that the government intends to possibly teach students of the California Public School System. In short, I believe that the curriculum is FACTUALLY INACCURATE, DISCRIMINATORY, OFFENSIVE AND CLEARLY ANTISEMETIC. I believe that if such curriculum - or anything similar there to - in enacted and taught, the state of California will be inundated with lawsuits. I personally will be in the forefront of such legal activity.
I am a proud Jew and a first generation American. My parents were exiled TWICE purely because of religious persecution - once from Iraq and then from Iran. We came to the US with NOTHING. We worked hard. I was first generation college and graduate school educatione. We took out loans - and repaid them. WE WORKED HARD with absolutely no recognition or privilage.
Jews as a religion, as a community, as PEOPLE, have categorically succeeded resiliantly. We are an extremely small portion of the world's population but we have achieved an extraordinary amount of success, wealth, education and have contributed SUBSTANTIALLY to the world. We fought for our own nation and created it. The palestinians never did that. Other religions never did that. And we FIGHT to keep what we have created. We also WORK HARD. We believe in FAMILY. We believe in EDUCATION.
The current draft of the curriculum celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting "Jews of color" against Jews who are tarred with "conditional whiteness" and its attendant "racial privilege." What about this is a positive reflection of international history that would benefit and encourage students to understand Jews and white people alike?
"White supremacists continue to racialize Jews as non-white," the curriculum's "Fact Sheet on Jewish American Diversity" acknowledges. But "many Jews with light skin identify with the idea of white-presenting," it reads. "Light-skinned Jews...experience white privilege," while "Jews of color like all communities of color face systemic racism." In other words, the same kind of Jews who, in living memory, were forced into ovens for being non-white, are now identified as white нн or at a minimum, as having "conditional whiteness." This disqualifies most Jews from the solidarity offered to other minority groups.
WHAT PART OF YOUR PROPOSED CURRICULUM IS TRUE? IF THIS CURRICULUM PASSES, IT WILL SYSTEMATICALLY BREAD ANTISEMITISM. WE WILL FIGHT YOU SO HARD IF THAT HAPPENS.
Thank you for your consideration and I really hope - and PRAY - that you, whoever is reading this, makes a PERSONAL choice to stop antisemitism. Do a google search on how many Jews have added to society, and how many amazing products, inventions, innovations have come from Israel.
I can write so much more but I am a single mom, self-made attorney and I need to get back to work and represent my clients.
Best Regards, Selena
