From: Don Chen Sent: Saturday, December 19, 2020 1:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Complaints of current ESMC
Dear Officiers, I am a US citizen living in Fremont, CA. I am writing to express great concern for the perversion of history that is being perpetrated by the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The content does not provide all historical facts, widen their views and encourage them to look at the issue from multiple perspectives, instead it has a strong impulsive narrow political viewpoint & force students to accept & comply. It is divisive & encourages victimization. I strongly request the The Ethnic Model Studies Curriculum be revised to provide a balanced range of perspectives, remove the political agenda, and inspire mutual respect and dignity. Thank you very much! Sincerely, Don Chen
