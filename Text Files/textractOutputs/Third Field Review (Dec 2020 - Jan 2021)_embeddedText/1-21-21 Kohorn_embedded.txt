The section on Jewish people in your ethnic studies curriculum is unacceptable, especially in light of the alarming rates of anti-Semitism in California and across the globe.
I don't understand where you gathered your data. Most American Jews do NOT try to hide their Jewishness by changing their names. If they do change their names, it is only to escape from anti-Semitism, not to "gain some privilege".
How can you mention Jews without mentioning anti-Semitism? Did you take ideas from "Mein Kampf" and other Nazi literature to design your curriculum? Jews do not have white "Privilege", unless you consider getting your places of worship and business attacked, or getting assaulted or killed for being Jewish, as signs of privilege.
Your curriculum needs a complete overhaul and you need to consult with Jewish leaders before you poison our students, or you will have blood on your hands.
Sincerely, Lisa Kohorn
