From: Adam Silver Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 12:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will increase Anti-Semitism!!!!
Dear California Curriculum Board,
Jews are only less than 2% of the American population but they are the second most targeted ethnic group with hate crimes now (LGBTQ are the #1 targets). Please represent your constituency, which is your job and stop putting this curriculum through. In it the word "privileged" is only used in reference to one ethnic group and that is Jews. That is not only dangerous and scary, it is the oldest form of genocidal hatred we know of - going back to Roman times. It's enough already! There is enough hate in the world. We don't need Ethnic Studies classes to propagate more of it! Please. I already fear for my life as a Jew every time I leave my house. this will make it worse. I certainly am not privileged! I'm hated
