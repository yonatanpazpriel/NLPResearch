From: Merrill Sent: Thursday, January 14, 2021 7:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear California Department of Education,
Thank you for listening to the concerns of the Israeli American and Jewish communities in California.
Please include the link to the IHRA definition of antisemitism in the glossary for teachers to refer to.
Please finalize a curriculum that does not contain BDS or antisemitism, as in the content that was previously removed.
Sincerely,
Merrill Nanigian
