From: Judea Pearl Sent: Friday, January 15, 2021 7:09 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Judea Pearl Subject: [EXTERNAL] Expanded public comment on the 2021 Californial Ethnic Studies Model Curiculum
To: Members the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) and the State Board of Education. From: Judea Pearl, Chancellor's Professor, UCLA
I strongly oppose the 2021 California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am particularly alarmed by its attempt to depict inter-ethnic relationships as a irreconcilable struggle between racially-defined "oppressed" and oppressors" and by the way it associates "whiteness" with "oppression" and "colonialism".
I am a "white" Jewish American, and I believe that the history of my people is a model of emancipation from oppression and colonialism, culminating in the State of Israel which is an inspirational model of an oppressed ethnic minority lifting itself from the margin of history to become a world center of art, science and entrepreneurship -- a multi-colored light-house of free speech and gender equality.
I want my grandchildren to take pride in this historical transformation and to share our experience with other minorities; yet sharing as equal partners in one colorful mosaic of ethnic diversity, not as guiltstricken "Whites", burdened with undeserved privileges.
The idea of mutually respectful ethnic diversity has been at the heart of California Education for decades, and I know firsthand that it can be operationalized successfully.
For the past 15 years I have seen it practiced in the Daniel Pearl Magnet School, here in Los Andeles, California, a top-ranking school named after my late son, Daniel Pearl. I have seen, year after year, how students of diverse background and heritage walk with a flower in their hand and, speaking in the parents' language--Spanish, Hebrew, English, Russian and Arabic-- place the flower in a huge Baguette in the center of the room � a symbol of their unity and common humanity.
I dread to see this spirit of comradeship ruined by the "oppressed" � "oppressor" ideology of the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
