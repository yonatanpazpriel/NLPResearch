From: ARTHUR Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 5:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews are not "privileged"
Dear Sir/Madam,
Your ethnic studies curriculum associates the word "privilege" with Jews with light colored skin. Indeed, of all the ethnic groups that you describe, Jews are the only group that you place the word "privilege" besides.
Given that a large percent of American Jews are 1-2 generations from the death camps and zero to one generations from being forced to leave their homes due to hostility against them for being Jews, I feel that using the term "privilege" is highly inappropriate. It generates the same kind of hostility against Jews that led to the death camps and expulsion.
My paternal grandparents left Russia to come to America. Because of the laws at the time, my grandfather came alone, and had to work for over 7 years to be able to bring his wife and two sons into America. Sadly, one of the boys died before that was possible.
During World War 2, my grandmother had to watch as the relatives she had stayed with while she was waiting to rejoin her husband were all hunted down and murdered by the Nazi regime. Her supposed "privilege" did not help overcome the racism of the president and his administration, which put quotas on Jewish immigration. She had a box with pictures of the cousins and their children, babies she had fed and played with, whom she could not help to escape.
My father grew up when there was a quota on how many Jews could attend certain universities, law schools and medical schools. Even now, Jews are the most frequent victims of hate crimes.
Not only does describing Jews as privileged ignore the hardships we have and continue to face, but it promotes hostility towards us.
I urge you to revise your curriculum to increase tolerance toward Jews and all people rather than decrease it.
Thank you!
