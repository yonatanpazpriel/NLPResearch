To Whom It May Concern,
I noticed a proposed state-wide mandate was being discussed in regards to the history and viewpoint of Jews. As someone who was born and raised in California, I am horrified and offended that the curriculum is highlighting anti-Semetic individuals as prominent figures, classifying Jews as the only ethnic group that is "privileged," and furthering anti-Semitic propaganda.
Can you imagine, for a second, if other ethnic groups were being targeted? What if, for example, blacks were being targeted and demeaned in state-wide curriculum and reverting back to using racial terminology and segregating the population against all other state-wide residents? Everyone would be up in arms about this; but because its anti-Semitism that is being falsely imposed on future generations, its acceptable. Jews represent a small percent of the world (0.2%) and the United States (2%) and continue, as a minority, to be demonized. This is disgusting and terrible to think that the next generation will be raised in an environment that promotes such hatred and falsehood.
I expect all of the proposed anti-Semetic curriculum to be removed immediately. I hope all California residents feel the same way about this curriculum. If it is not reversed/overturned, then Jews will be forced to flee California in order to escape bigotry (sound familiar?), which will hopefully have a significant economic impact on this state. It's truly sickening that this is even being discussed in 2021.
