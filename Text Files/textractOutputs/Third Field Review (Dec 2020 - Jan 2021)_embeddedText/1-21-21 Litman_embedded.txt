From: Tchia Litman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:49 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Commentary on the Ethnic Studies Model Courriculum
Dear Mme/Sir,
1. Thank you for presenting the curriculum to public comments.
2. Having just celebrated Martin Luther King's Day, may I remind you of his doctrine that people should be judged based not on the color of their skin, but on the content of their character.
3. Using pigment, or any immutable characteristic, as a way to characterize people is inherently racist, and has no place in society. Could you imagine ranking students on their physical beauty?
4. As a psychologist, I assure you that such a dogma would only adversely affect the mental welfare of students of any color and shade.
5. As an alternative, may I suggest focusing on social values such as kindness, empathy, and help to others.
I thank you,
