I can't imagine why you would teach awful things about America without also teaching what America has done to overcome the things we have done wrong. Only a person or group of people who truly hate this country would think to teach only the bad things about our wonderful country. If it's so abhorrent, why would you continue to live here. I've traveled the world and lived in the middle east. and I'm always grateful to have been born and raised in this beautiful country. We are truly blessed and I think our young people need to understand that. Please consider changing your curriculum..
Thank you.
