From: Jennifer Esfandi Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comment on ethnic studies curriculum
The current Ethnic Studies draft has a blind spot that is rooted in discrimination and antisemitism. Information regarding Jews is is steeped in antisemetic tropes and should therefore effectuate a vote of no confidence! As is, the curriculum celebrates leaders who have been antisemitic. It also encourages Nazi perpetuated ideas that Jews are try to infiltrate and take advantage of whiteness without any recognition of the genocidal atrocities directed at Jews within recent history and hate acts that continue to take place.
This curriculum "others" Jews and is dangerous and unacceptable.
