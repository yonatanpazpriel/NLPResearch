From: Debby Koken Sent: Saturday, January 16, 2021 1:58 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum at the finish line!
Dear Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board of Education, and Superintendent Tony Thurmond:
I support the development of an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that centers on the narratives of Black Americans, Latinx, Asian Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans, while also including the many diverse communities that make up our state, including Jews.
As a Jew, I had significant concerns with the earlier drafts of the curriculum. The recommendations approved at the IQC meeting in November were great improvements. My only remaining comments are:
1. Ensure that BDS or antisemitism, like the content that was previously removed, is not added back as some propose. 2. Definitions of antisemitism, which have been added, must remain in the curriculum; also, the glossary should include a link to the official IHRA definition of antisemitism - https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism 3. Retain the lessons added to the curriculum in November about Korean, Sikh, Armenian, Arab, and Jewish Americans, to reflect California's ethnic diversity. 4. Remove references to current or historical figures that engaged in antisemitic rhetoric or behavior.
If well done, an Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will help students build empathy and understanding, and support the fight against hatred, bigotry, and white supremacy in our society at large.
I thank you for your hard work on the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Sincerely, Deborah Koken
