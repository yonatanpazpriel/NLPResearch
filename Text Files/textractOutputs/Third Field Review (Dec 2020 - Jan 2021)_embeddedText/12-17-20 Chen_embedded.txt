From: Fang Chen Sent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 7:51 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Critical Ethnic Study
The content of Critical Ethnic Study is nothing but racialism to Asian people. Hard working is not the original sin and should not be discouraged.
I DO NOT want this curriculum to be taught in my high school.
