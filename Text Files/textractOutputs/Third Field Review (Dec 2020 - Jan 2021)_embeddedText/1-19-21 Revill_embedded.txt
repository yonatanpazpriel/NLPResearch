From: K Revill Sent: Monday, January 18, 2021 9:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) third field review comments
Hi, I'd like to respectfully submit comments for improvement to this ESMC curriculum:
By using critical theory as a basis for this curriculum we are introducing a very important but flawed method to instruction. Although this category of theory is important work and should be studied, when critical theory is put into practiice, it becomes destructive to the very society we want to improve. We want to end the hierarchy that produces an oppressive system and yet this magnifies it, justifies it and doesn't produce healing, improve resilience or mental and emotional health. If the progress and success of the great system of California is your goal, then it begins with excellent education that is founded in solid principles that help develop the very things that this current curriculum undermines. We must have these histories and experiences heard and studied, but without the underlying method that has proven negative results. Most sincerely, K Revill
