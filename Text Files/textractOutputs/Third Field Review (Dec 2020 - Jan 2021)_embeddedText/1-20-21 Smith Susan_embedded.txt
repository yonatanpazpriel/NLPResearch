From: Susan Smith Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum change
I am disgusted that you have chosen to change the curriculum to enhance anti semitism. How dare you call your department ethnic studies. I was both in south Africa and left because of their apartheid policies. Your policies enhance every part of separation and lack of understanding that I left. My family had to leave 3 countries in 3 generations because of anti semitism To use a word `privilege' to describe a group of people that have consistently been criticized and attacked. I doubt any of you have ever visited israel to understand what the Jewish people have accomplished in a generation. I'm so sad today to call myself an American
