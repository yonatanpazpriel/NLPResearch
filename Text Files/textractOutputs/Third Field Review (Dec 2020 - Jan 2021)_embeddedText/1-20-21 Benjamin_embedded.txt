Hi,
I strongly believe a strong Jewish curriculum needs to exist in the weekly public school curriculum as the Jews have a long and depth history that should Brit be forgotten. The curriculum should be taught to all so that Jews are better understood and respected for all the things they have gone through. This is particularly important because their history is what encourages them to strive for a better world and their existence is a constant battle and to this day are a strong force.
Thank you,
Nazzi Benjamin
