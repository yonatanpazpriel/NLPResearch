Dear State Board of Education,
Founded in 1969, Chinese for Affirmative Action is a community based civil rights organization committed to advancing a multiracial democracy. Towards that end, we advocate for systemic change that protects the rights of immigrants and seeks remedies to racial and economic injustice including in our education system.
Providing a high quality education must include teaching about the diverse history and rich contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. As such, Chinese for Affirmative Action broadly supports the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association's efforts to make California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum more inclusive and equitable.
We believe our education systems and educational institutions have an important role and tremendous responsibility in addressing and eliminating racism. It is vital that California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum provide foundational guidance on what is essential in preparing students to uphold U.S. democratic principles including the fair and humane treatment of all people regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender and national origin.
We must take seriously this moment of racial reckoning to ensure that we learn from our past so we don't repeat the same mistakes.
Sincerely,
Cynthia Choi Co-Executive Director
