I have noticed a couple holes in the Native studies section of the model ethnic studies curriculum:
1. There is a need for a clear timeline of the invasion of settlers and its impact on California tribes from pre-contact to the genocidal policies of the state of California to our current times; 2. The Current issues, problems, hopes and goals of California tribes - needs a lesson; 3. An over view of the cultural Revival of California tribes - needs a lesson 4. Current Topics - needs a lesson: such as the environment, dam removal on rivers, XL pipeline controversy & impact on all tribes, Indian gaming and its impact, and the new Truth and Healing Council recently set-up by Governor Newsome through Executive Order N-15-19 through 2025.
5. Myths and Stereotypes Correction - needs a lesson: The myth about Indian Gaming and Casinos and all tribes are getting rich; The myth about Native Americans being extinct or obsolete (past tense used all too frequently); the myth that each American Indian student knows everything about native culture; myth that All Native people live on Reservations, the myth that all Native people "share" a religion, the myth that all American Indians participate in pow-wows or that all natives know about tee-pees; the myth that each American Indian student gets a free ride to college; as well as the stereotypes surrounding Indian mascots (where you do have a lesson). 6. The AIM (American Indian Movement) and "Alcatraz Island occupation" as a part of the civil rights movement could be a lesson with a focus on California tribes.
Thanks for all work !
