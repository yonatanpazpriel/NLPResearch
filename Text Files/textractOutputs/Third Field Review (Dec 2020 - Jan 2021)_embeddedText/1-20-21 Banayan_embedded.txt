From: Banayan, April Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 2:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethical studies Curriculum
To Whom it May Concern,
As a medical student at the University of Southern California. I am deeply concerned with the rhetoric being used in your ethnic studies curriculum. Antisemtism is on the rise and over 70% of hate crimes in this country are targeted towards jewish people. Your curriculum that claims jews are privilaged and also states they are actors that continue to change their names is exactly the kind of language used in Nazi germany and the many other genocides of jewish people. I implore you to take a strong look at yourself in the mirror and reconsider the ramifications of teaching such a deeply antisemetic curriculum or you will be just as bad as the white supremists you claim to fight. If you would like further detail I am happy to talk more about this issue via phone or email, but as a California citizen I am deeply concerned.
