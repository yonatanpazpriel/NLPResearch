From: Jasmine Pezeshki Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on the Proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To the co directors of California's Ethnic Studies curriculum-
I am writing in regards to the deeply offensive, inaccurate, and irresponsible proposal of CA ethnic studies curriculum. As an American Jew, I believe the use of the word "privilege" in the context of the Jewish community is historically untrue. My ancestors have been persecuted, victimized, and murdered systematically through out our tragic history. The mere mention of the Holocaust doesn't appear, however the curriculum does mention the white passing nature of some Jews. As a middle eastern Jew- I am far from white passing- but I do pass as a Jew and am on the receiving end of many bigoted opinions and hate crimes. My community has been through a tremendous plight, we have been rounded up and walked into gas chambers, lived in fear for generations, and still live as the smallest ethnic minority that receives the most hate globally.
I emplore you to do the RIGHT THING and rewrite the program taught to the California youth. Include the teachings of the truth of the horrific Holocaust. Include the teachings of what it means to be ethnically Jewish and the origin of the Jewish people from Judaea. Include the FULL STORY of the Jewish people because when we say "never again" that begins with EDUCATION. Jews have been historically marginalized and the pinnacle of hate, do not contribute to this cycle.
Furthermore, I also plead that you remove the teachings of antisemitic people. Your responsibility is not only to the Jewish community, but the international community.
Regards,
Jasmine Pezeshki
