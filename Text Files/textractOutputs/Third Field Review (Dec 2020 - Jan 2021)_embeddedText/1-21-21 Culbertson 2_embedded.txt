I believe there is a Major error in your contemplated anti- Semitic curriculum. Jewish identity is an ethnicity- NOT a race! Racial blood lines among Jews emanate from varied races- not just Middle Eastern or Caucasian origins. It is also usually accompanied by a religious identity as Judaism. Please clarify these distinctions. Diaspora is also not exactly correct. It refers to the "spreading out" of the Jewish populace over different parts of Europe and the Middle East primarily due to their need to escape extinction, mass murder or prejudicial suffering.
