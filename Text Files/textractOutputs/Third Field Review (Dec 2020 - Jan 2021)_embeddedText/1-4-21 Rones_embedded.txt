As an African American man this is absolutely rediculous. There is no need to teach subjects such as this. It is apparent that the last 4 years every political agenda has been trojan horsed in under the guise of "equality" and "ethnic unity". Keep this out of schools. Public education is already bad enough and this course shouldn't be funded for with tax dollars at all. I'll be voting for anyone Pro School choice and considering private education if this is adopted. I'll be sure to spread the word about this.
