From: Shiva Hedvat Borukhim Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:02 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic curriculum re: Jewish people
To Whom it May Concern:
I ak writing to ask you to revise the section referring to white Jews as privileged. This is antisemitic and completely undermines the point of this new curriculum.
Sincerely, Shiva Borukhim
