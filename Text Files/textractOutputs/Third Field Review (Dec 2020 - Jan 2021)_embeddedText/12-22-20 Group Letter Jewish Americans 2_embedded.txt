From: Barbara Miller Sent: Tuesday, December 22, 2020 3:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
1. I appreciate the two lesson plans on Jewish Americans � Sample Lessons 40 and 41, Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans and Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race.
o Please retain the above lessons.
o Please add ADL's lesson BINAH � Building Insights to Navigate Antisemitism and Hate
2. Thanks for listing antisemitism as a form of bigotry and oppression in the ESMC, especially at a time of increasing hate crimes and incidents targeting Jews. o Please use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism, which the European Union and U.S. State Department adopted during the Obama Administration.
3. Please provide transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC.
4. I support a pedagogically sound Ethnic Studies course incorporating "core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" (Education Code section 51226.7) to enrich California students' understanding of American history and current events.
