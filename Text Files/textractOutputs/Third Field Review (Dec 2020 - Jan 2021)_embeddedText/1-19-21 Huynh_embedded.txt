Dear State Board of Education,
My name is Amy Huynh and I was born and raised in California. I am now an environmental educator with Slide Ranch.
I support the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) request for revisions to the final draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the State Board of Education (SBE) in March 2021.
The desired revisions which are focused on usability, accessibility, and equity are as follows:
1. 2. 3. The "Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth" Lesson, Sample Lesson #31 in
Appendix A, should be listed as the first sample lesson in the AAPI unit 4. and be rewritten to remove stereotypes and to incorporate reflection based on analyzing
data. 5. 6. 7. 8. Language should be added to Chapter 3: Instructional Guidance for K-12 Education to
frame "Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth" as a foundational 9. lesson to the AAPI Unit and as an indispensable component of any Ethnic Studies
course. 10. 11. 12. 13. In the AAPI Unit, the pan-Asian lesson plans should be listed first, followed by one
lesson plan per ethnic group in alphabetical order, and concluding 14. with an additional resources section for groups with more than one lesson plan. Groups
with more than one lesson plan should provide input on which lesson plan is foundational for their group. 15. 16.

17. Appendix A should be reclassified as "Chapter 4" in the ESMC and "Chapter 4: Bibliography"
18. should be reclassified as "Chapter 5: Bibliography" Appendices A and B (formerly Appendices B and C). The lesson plans must be highlighted as core content for educators to build Ethnic Studies courses, not as supporting content in an Appendix.
19.
"Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies" is an indispensable asset to the teaching of Ethnic Studies. I join local, statewide, and national organizations in support of the final approval of the ESMC; with these edits to the AAPI Unit and to the ESMC in general, I believe California students will soon experience a curriculum that better represents the diversity of our community.
Thank you. Sincerely,
