From: KEVIN BURKE Sent: Sunday, January 3, 2021 9:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Critical Race Theory
I stand in opposition to the Critical Race Theory curriculum which teaches that all white people are inherently oppressors and are therefore racist. This curriculum is divisiive, destructive, and dead wrong. You should be ashamed of yourself for deliberately trying to encourage more hatred and this course in itself is racist. You are hateful.
Shame on you Peggy Burke
