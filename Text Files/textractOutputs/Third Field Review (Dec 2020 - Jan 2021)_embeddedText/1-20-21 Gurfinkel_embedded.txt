From: Olga Gurfinkel, Pharm.D. Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 11:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
This new proposed curriculum is absolutely preposterous. It will only creat a further misinformation and divide between people. We need a curriculum that will unite and inform the next generation.
