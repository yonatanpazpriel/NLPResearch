From: [email redacted] Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 11:04 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Classifying Jews as Privileged Whites
As a Jew of Spanish and Austrian heritage I was both shocked and saddened to read of your recent direction on curriculum.
I would request that rethink your terminology, intent, purpose & wording if your goal is to not to promote anti-Semitism, hate, or misinformation.
Unfortunately, what is proposed in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will do nothing but serve those who seek to bring down the Jewish people. To be blunt, and speaking personally, we are not "white privileged" having fled the Spanish Inquisition on one side of my family and the other side simply wiped out (despite their light skin color) by the Nazis.
Many a person before you has accidentally embraced and empowered the forces of anti-Semitism and hate.
Don't be one of them.
