Hello, I was notified that the state is about to push the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to our schools. After I reviewed the information, I am extremely concerned about the contents and intentions of such a curriculum being pushed to our next generation. The ESMC is highly politically inclined which divides students into different 'classes' and tries to confuse them with the so called victims and oppressors. This curriculum will make students confused, create more conflicts and hate towards the 'dominant cultures'. This curriculum will divide rather than unite communities!!! Many parts of the curriculum intend to advocate violent revolution and hatred of successful ethnic groups, with the intention of politically brainwashing millions of students. Our kids should be educated with law and order as well as social improvements, but not with VIOLENT revolution to destroy the things and ideas they don't agree with. This is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our school!.
Best regards,
