From: Susan Wharton Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Unfair ethnic portrayed of America's Jewish community
To Whom it may concern:
I am against the unfair portrayal of the Jewish community in the proposed ethnic studies program for California. We must embark on a way of thinking that all Americans are equal. There is a danger in an "us versus them" attitude which pits one ethnic group against any other. I fear the proposed program is racism in reverse. A shame! Please be even handed not let that happen! We have a chance for all Americans to pull together, hand in hand.
