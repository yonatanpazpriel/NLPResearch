I oppose Critical Race Studies being taught in our schools. I am a grandma with grandkids in school. I never thought that much about different races until Obama became President and he somehow made it a big deal. The more it was brought to the forefront the bigger problem it became. It was making a mountain out of a mole hill. It was bringing a bad fairy tale to life just by repeating it over and over. That kind of talk does not belong in our schools. Neldine Valles
