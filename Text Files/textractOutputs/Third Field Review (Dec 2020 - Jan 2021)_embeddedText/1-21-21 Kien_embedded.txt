Hello,
My name is Eira Kien and I am a City College of San Francisco student. I am writing to urge the board to include Palestine in the curriculum, in order to not further erase that important history when it comes to Arab American history. Furthermore, I wish there is more detail and breadth of perspective in regards to the Vietnam War, which has affected the lives of many including my refugee parents. Please center it through the lens of the Vietnamese, and anti-imperialism, anti-colonalism, along with anti-militarization. If we are addressing anti-racism now, those three aforementioned is intertwined with that concept.
Thank you, Eira Kien
