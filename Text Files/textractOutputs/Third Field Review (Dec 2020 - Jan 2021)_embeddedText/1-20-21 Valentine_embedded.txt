While the state's intention may be good, I think the ethnic studies program is a mistake. Students in California are below average in math and English. They are financially illiterate. They know little about US History, and government. The last thing they need is to spend time on a curriculum to will only end up dividing people. What happened to e pluribus unum? This country was founded on from many one. Now California wants to teach the opposite, from one to many. I also noticed that the course says nothing about Western Civilization. Why is that? Obviously, that is part of the heritage of this country, including California.
I am also concerned about the African-American portion. Will the 1619 Project be included, even though it is false history? Will Critical Race Theory be taught?
Biden says we must unite. I believe this course will not do that, but only preach and teach hate.
Instead the schools need to teach students how to read, write, and think. Every high school student should be required to take at least one semester of Accounting 101 to prepare them for business and life.
Ethinc studies is a waste of time, and filled with propaganda.
