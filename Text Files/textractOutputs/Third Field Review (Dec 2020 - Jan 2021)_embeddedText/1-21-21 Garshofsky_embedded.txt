From: Judith Garshofsky Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnics Studies Curriculum
I find the Proposed Curriculum despicable. Jews as the only Ethnic Group labeled "privileged?" Why don't you include the genocide and repeated discrimination directed against Jews. We are successful because we work hard! Change the curriculum. There is no place in CA for directed anti-Semitism and racism.
