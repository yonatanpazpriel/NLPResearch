From: David Bratslavsky Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 3:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Promote Tolerance in Proposed Curriculum
Jews are the only group in California's new proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. Is that okay? No! Please revise your curriculum to promote tolerance, not hostility!
Sincerely, ____________________ David Bratslavsky
