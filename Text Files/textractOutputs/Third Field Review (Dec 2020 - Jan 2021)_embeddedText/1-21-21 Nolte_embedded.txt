To Whom It May Concern:
I was very impressed with the ESMC information. However, I feel that one very important item has not been covered and it should be covered at the very beginning. It has to do with discourse styles based on Robert B. Kaplan's 1966 article: Cultural Thought Patterns in Inter-cultural Education. CULTURAL THOUGHT PATTERNS IN INTER-CULTURAL EDUCATION - Kaplan - 1966 Language Learning - Wiley Online Library
I have taught students from around world various levels of English, from ESL 1 to TESOL Certificate class to adults from round the world. I always would discuss these thought patterns with them for validation. I learned that just because one has a certain native language it does not mean that the model fits. I've learned that the models can change from listening, reading, writing, speaking. I found his article very helpful because when I was first working with mostly native Spanish speakers [Mexican], I couldn't understand why they were making 'logical' mistakes when writing essays. There is much more.
If you are interested in my experiences, I'd be happy to speak with someone and share them.
Most of what is suggested in the curriculum I have done for decades. I am so happy to see that now it is recommended.
Sincerely,
Linda M. Nolte, PhD
