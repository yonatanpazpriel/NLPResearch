Dear Sir/Madame, As a California tax payer, as well as the child of a Holocaust Survivor, I am appauled at the proposed model for change in Ethnic Studies across the State of California. I also have a degree in anthropology from a major University. First of all, THERE IS ONLY RACE! THE HUMAN RACE! Any anthropologist worth their diploma knows this. Also, my name from my Jewish father has never been changed and if other immigrants names have been changed, it's often because those who checked them in at Ellis Island and other ports of entry, often could not pronounce their given names. And of those of who did change their names by choice? It's called assimilation, which is what living in American's melting pot ( or perhaps the term Mixing Bowl is a better description) is all about. Signalling out Jews as 'privileged' is very telling about the creators of this model. Perhaps they have an axe to grind with some former colleague who identifies as Jewish? I implore you to reconsider this proposed curriculum. And I would venture a guess not one has a higher degree in Ethnic Studies or Anthropology, if they did, they would realize that the proposed changes are not only highly flawed, they are factually incorrect.
Sincerely, Jill Steinfeld Cunniff . M.S. P.S. I would like to add that my husband of Swedish and Irish ethnicity, has found that his surname back in County Mayo, Ireland was MacCondibh. It was then Angelicized to MacCuniffe,and then upon entering Ellis Island his great grandfather had the name changed to Cunniff. So by signalling out Jews as the only ethnic group ( the framers of the proposal incorrectly use 'race') they are factually, wrong and clearly pushing an anti Semitic agenda.
