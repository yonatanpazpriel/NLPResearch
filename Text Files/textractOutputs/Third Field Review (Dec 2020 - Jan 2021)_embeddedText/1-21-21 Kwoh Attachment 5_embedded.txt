Lesson Overview:
Through this lesson, students will learn how climate change has had a devastating impact to the Pacific Islander population. Students will learn about pleads for action by Pacific Islanders in solving the climate devastation to their home islands. Students will also explore Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner's poetry in order to craft and inspire their own poetry. After analyzing and interpreting the poems, students will recognize poetry as a vehicle to express untold stories about events/issues both small and large. This lesson will help students expand their viewpoints as they explore the readings and begin to work with poems. This lesson focuses on poetry's central ideas, similes, and metaphors. Students will learn how to craft central ideas for their poems, and use similes and metaphors in conveying their messages.
Lesson Objectives (Students will):
1. Learn about how climate change impacts the Marshallese, the people of the Marshall Islands. 2. Find the central idea of each of the readings/poems. 3. Identify and analyze similes and metaphors as effective devices in discussing everyday details/issues. 4. Analyze the impact of word choice in the creation of a particular mood. 5. Craft a poem with a central idea, similes, and metaphors.
Essential Questions:
1. What are the consequences of climate change to the Marshallese people? 2. What is Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner pleading when she says, "We are nothing without our islands"? 3. Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner addressed the United Nations' Climate Summit in 2014. Do you think the world

Lesson Steps/Activities:

Activity 1: Structure of a poem and introduction of the poet
Explain to students: We will study Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner's two poems on climate change and the consequence of climate change to the Marshallese people of the Marshall Islands, and her plea for a solution to the climate devastation there.
We will begin with an introduction to the basic structure of a poem.
1. Basic Structure of a Poem:

Prose Structure: Poetry Structure:

Sentence

Line

Paragraph

Stanza

Point out to students that in poems, lines do not necessarily have to be complete sentences. Likewise, a stanza can range from only one line to multiple lines.
2. Provide Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner's background: � Kathy was born in the Marshall Islands. She moved to Hawai'i at the age of 7, and moved back to the Marshall Islands at the age of 25 � She is a climate activist, and addressed the United Nations' Climate Summit in 2014 � She writes about the nuclear testing conducted in the Marshall Islands, militarism, the rising sea level as a result of climate change, forced migration, and racism in America � From 1946 to 1958, the U.S. conducted 67 nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands, which equates to 1.6 Hiroshima-size explosions per day o In 1945 during World War II , the U.S. dropped two nuclear bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki--later leading to the end of the war

Activity 3: Similes and Metaphors
Explain to students: In this lesson you will learn what similes and metaphors are, and how to identify, create and analyze them.
1. Use these examples to explain literal and figurative language: a. Literal language: "It was raining a lot, so I rode the bus." � In this example of literal language, the writer means to explain exactly what is written: that he/she chose to ride the bus because of the heavy rain. b. Figurative language: "It was raining cats and dogs, so I rode the bus." � In this example of figurative language, there weren't actual cats and dogs falling from rain clouds, instead, the rain was so heavy and large in quantity that it was almost as if small animals were falling from the sky.
2. Similes and metaphors are figurative language: Review the following examples and ask the students to explain what each means.

Simile
using "like" or "as" 1 Life is like a journey. 2 You are like sunshine on a cloudy day. 3 You are like a hurricane: there's calm in your
eye, but I'm getting blown away.
