Greetings:
As an Arab-American, I'm writing to strongly object to the shocking process employed by CDE to develop over the past two years an ethnic studies curriculum. At the heart of my objection is the intervention of political entities into the recommended curriculum developed by ethnic studies educators. The original draft curriculum included information about the large Palestinian community in this country with that curriculum developed with the help of scholars in that field of study. Unfortunately, and under tremendous political pressure from groups like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), subsequent drafts of the model curriculum, including the current draft, were changed with the Palestinian American experience completely expunged from the latest draft.
Tony Thurmond brought politics into this process and disregarded the advice of the experts on this matter. He has now lost my support because of this shameful act.
Chris.
