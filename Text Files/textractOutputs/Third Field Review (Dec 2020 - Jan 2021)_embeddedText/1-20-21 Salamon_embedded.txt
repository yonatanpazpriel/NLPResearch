From: Adam Salamon Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:08 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-Semitism in Ethnic Studies
To Those In Charge of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum,
Please reconsider singling the Jewish people out as targets for this blatant anti-semitism. There is no place for hate in the public school system, this is dangerous to the Jewish community and I fear their will be blood on your hands for your incitement to hate.
Sincerely,
Adam Salamon
