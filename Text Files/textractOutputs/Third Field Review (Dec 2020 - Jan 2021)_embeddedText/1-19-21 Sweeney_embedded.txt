To whom it may concern,
I write in opposition to the latest draft model curriculum. Ethnic Studies must be representative of all ethnic groups. I request that the ethinc studies curriculum include a module on Irish Americans, a significant ethnic minority in California and one which experienced marginalization, discrimination in the US and ethnocide in its home country. Irish Americans have been a critical part of this history of this country and this state and deserve their own curriculum. The current draft is racist and deficient for including only blacks, latinos, asians, and native americans.
Thank you,
