From: Rosalin Radbod Azizi Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:21 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethics
To whom it may concern,
I had the chance to review the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I found it to be highly offensive and anti-Semitic. Please consider the effects this would have on children and our future generations. Many of us, myself included, escaped the antisemitism in other countries and found a home in the United States for protection from vile discrimination. Please do not allow history to repeat itself.
Best, Rosalin Azizi
