From: GARY HURD Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:53 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed Curriculum
ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov
The American History textbooks of the 1950s and `60s were racist trash. I grew up in those days. I read that "African slaves were happy and well cared for," and that "the brave settlers had to kill the violent Indians in self defense."
Reviewing the proposed lesson plans for the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) showed me the same level of racist bias, just turned 180 degrees.
The core problem seems to me to be that the ESMC has been perverted by the Critical Ethnic Studies (CES) approach. CES, I prefer "Confrontational Extreme Situations", was intended for adults with graduate degrees in Law. I actually support that application. It is not, should not, and cannot be adopted for children.
There needs to be a single simple message for all pages of the proposed instruction set, "It has been bad. Children did not make it bad. We are going to make it better."
That this curriculum as reached this far into the adoption process suggests to me that it is not repairable. Instead it will take millions of dollars wasted in legal suits brought by parents against the Californian DoE to withdraw it.
Kill this now. Start over, or we all pay later.
