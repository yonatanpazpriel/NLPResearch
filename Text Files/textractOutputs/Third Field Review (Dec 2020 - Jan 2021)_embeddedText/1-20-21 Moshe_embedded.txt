From: Jeffrey Mosh� Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Action Required: Revise your curriculum intolerant toward Jews.
Dear Sir/Madam,
Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used.
This is definitely not acceptable.
This message is a formal request that you, the California Department of Education, revise your ETHNIC STUDIES curriculum to promote tolerance, not hostility!
Your ethnic studies curriculum associates the word "privilege" with Jews with light colored skin. Indeed, of all the ethnic groups that you describe, Jews are the only group that you place the word "privilege" beside.
Given that a large percent of American Jews are 1-2 generations from the death camps and zero to one generation from being forced to leave their homes due to hostility against them for being Jews, I feel that using the term "privilege" is highly inappropriate. It generates the same kind of hostility against Jews that led to expulsion, the death camps and near extermination in Europe during the Holocaust.
I urge you to revise your curriculum to increase tolerance toward Jews and all people rather than decrease it.
This issue and message has been forwarded to the JDL DC Regional Office.
I look forward to both your positively inclusive revisions relative to this concerning curriculum and your response to this message.
Thank you!
Jeffrey Mosh�
