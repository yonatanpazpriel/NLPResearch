From: Gloria Gregory Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Developing an Ethnic Studies Pedagogy for K-12 Education
The first sentence under Developing an Ethnic Studies Pedagogy for Kï¿½12 Education in Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Chapter 3 reads: Ethnic studies teaching is grounded in the belief that education can be a tool for transformation, social, economic, and political change, and liberation.
As a parent and grandparent, I find that statement chilling. The board of education has no business in changing or liberating my child from what I am teaching and modeling. This curriculum seems to be based on critical race theory which uses an unproven narrative of systemic racism to divide people into oppressors and victims based on skin color.
Later in the paper comes this: Building on the theme of sexism and patriarchy, teachers can concentrate on the various ways in which women and femmes of color have been oppressed and resisted. Alternatively, this section can include a discussion on how women of color resisted and elevated women's rights issues (e.g., adequate reproductive health care and equal pay) via social movements (e.g., the second wave feminist and #Metoo movements). Why is this nothing but a blame game? And who decides what reproductive rights mean?
When you dictate that teachers use critical race theory as a pedagogy, you promote divisiveness through grouping people based on race. Are you saying it is okay to tell all the elementary kids in a class that if they're white, they are the bad oppressors while everyone else is being discriminated against? That is not acceptable! Any lesson plan that teaches or suggests that the United States of America is inherently racist or evil or any particular race or ethnic group is inherently racist or evil cannot be tolerated. Therefore, I very strongly urge you to reject this ethnic studies curriculum in its current form.
Sincerely,
