To whom it may concern,
As first generation American Iranian Jewish woman and a clinical psychologist, I am shocked at the ignorance of the use of the term privilege in relation to the Jewish people. I have spent years studying the dynamics of power, privilege, and oppression and to use the term privilege for the Jewish people is uneducated and ignorant.
Jews are a minority. There are not only European Jews, but Middle Eastern Jews, African Jews, and Asian Jews. To view Jews as "white" is presumptuous and incorrect. The history of the Jewish people is filled with persecution and seeking religious asylum. The one place that is considered "home" to the Jewish people, Israel, continues to be attacked by its neighboring middle eastern countries to this day. That is, to be clear, oppression, NOT privilege.
You have an ethical duty as an education organization to educate appropriately and accurately. Please help to take the privileged terminology out as it will fuel even more anti Semitism against my Jewish people.
Best, Yasmin Taban
