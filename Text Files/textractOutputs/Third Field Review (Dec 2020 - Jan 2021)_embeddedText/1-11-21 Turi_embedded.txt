I am very against the latest ethnic studies curriculum being established in California K-12 I feel it is critical race theory which is based on the Marxist doctrine of putting people into two categories oppressor or victim. This is not what we should be teaching our children It is at it's core divisive by assigning attributes to groups because of the color of their skin. White students are the oppressors and non-white students the victims. This is simply not correct and should not be allowed in our schools.
