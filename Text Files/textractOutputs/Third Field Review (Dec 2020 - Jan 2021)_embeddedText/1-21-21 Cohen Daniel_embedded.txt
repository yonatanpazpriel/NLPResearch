From: Daniel Cohen Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:48 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
My name is Daniel Cohen and I'm emailing now to voice my concern regarding the Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
My concerns stem from an article from the Jewish Journal that I'm attaching below;
https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/327667/jews-have-until-thursday-to-influence-ethnic-studiescurriculum/?fbclid=IwAR3fcuwjI94M6FpGdKpAaW1TNo3iM_o0Ynnfd-tn8t1OPd_jssh9kIcv70I
If anything outlined in the article are false please let me know as I'd love to be wrong.
But if the curriculum does indeed differentiate Jews based on skin color- classing white Jews as "privileged", and celebrates figures who've touted anti-semetism, then I urge you to reconsider and retract these "lessons".
Aside from the great offense that is being cast to the Jewish people, this will do nothing but further the divide in an already divided country.
In the name of unity and common decency, I ask you to reconsider.
-Daniel
