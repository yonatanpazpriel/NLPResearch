From: Melissa Moreno Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies; SBE Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove Name from ESMC - Time Sensitive Good morning CA Department of Education Leadership, I am a former Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee Member and elected official. I request that my name be removed as of now from the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum acknowledgements because the process, procedure, and text does not reflect my work and the work of Ethnic Studies teachers in the State of California. As the pandemic of racism continues, may there be improvements to future collaborations between Ethnic Studies teachers/educators and the CDE. Would you please contact me and other Ethnic Studies teachers/educators when and if there is a desire to work on authentic Ethnic Studies or Native Studies curriculum and when funding for Ethnic Studies professional development is available? Would you please confirm when my name is removed? Wish you well with your projects. Thank you.
