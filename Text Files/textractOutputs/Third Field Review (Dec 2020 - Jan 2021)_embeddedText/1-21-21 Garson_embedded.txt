� Ethnically �, I am a jew and nobody in my family ever thought of changing their name. On my father side, they were what you call � jews of color � because they were from Marroco and Algeria. Proud descendants of spanish jews, they never experienced � like all communities of color... systemic racism � as you put it. The proof: my father married my mother a white (ashkenazi) jew that was so privileged... that a good part of her family was gassed in Auschwitz. One was even killed by Klaus Barbie in Lyon (France). So, please, stop all this nonsense and refrain from teaching mere and pure antisemitism. And I'm sorry (or not so much) if, once again as usual in history, jews don't fit in your surreal categories.
