From: Bill Pisetsky Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:13 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews Have Until Thursday to Influence Ethnic Studies Curriculum By Pamela Paresky and Joel Finkelstein January 19, 2021
VERY DISAPPOINTED to read the referenced article in the JEWISH JOURNAL. Is it too much to ask for fairness in teaching? The answer to my question will not be within any return email. Rather, it will be in the final approved curriculum. Do the right thing. Be fair and honest. Bill
