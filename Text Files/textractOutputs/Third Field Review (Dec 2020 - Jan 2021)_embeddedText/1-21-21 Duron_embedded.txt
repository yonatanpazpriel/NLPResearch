From: Clementina Duron Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Framework
Happy New Year to IQC Members!
As we begin a new and hopeful year, I am requesting that you not sell out the 72% students of color here in California. For our high school students we do not need a white-washed curriculum framework that has been driven by non-educators of the Commission. I was so hopeful when over a year ago I heard a number of commissioners of color speak about their transformative experiences when they took Ethnic Studies at the university level. Yet today the Draft Framework leaves so much to be desired. The core principles have been abandoned. Model lesson plans are whitewashed and Arab American Studies has been decimated. What remains is what the powers to be have determined and not by educators of color.
We need to have an ESMC Framework that is authentic and speaks to the history and experiences of our students. For the sake of our students, please re-invite the original writers of the Framework to review and give you feedback.
As a student at Cal in 1969 who went out on strike to demand a Third World College that addressed our needs as students of color, I say that I would rather have no Framework at this time than to have a disingenuous, illegitimate, window-dressing curriculum.
Sincerely, Clementina Durï¿½n TWLF@UCB69
