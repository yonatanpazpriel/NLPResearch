Introduction
The final lesson of the 14-part series is dedicated to reflection. Each of the lessons in this curriculum introduced students to complex concepts and asked them to critically engage with and interrogate their own experiences, biases, and environments. Lesson 14 asks students to reflect upon the significance of the information they learned and to tie together the various knowledge and skills they acquired.
At the Islamic Networks Group (ING), we believe that in order to effectively contribute to positive change, we must first understand the driving forces behind the things we want to transform. To improve dominant narratives, we have to understand how they came to be so powerful and prevalent. To combat interpersonal and structural racism, we have to understand why and how they exist.
This curriculum began by introducing students to the concept of narratives and dominant narratives. We ended by asking students to brainstorm ways that they can take personal and collective action to eliminate prejudice and racism that stem from dominant narratives. Lesson 14 focuses on empowering students to use all they have learned to commit to continuous personal reflection and civic engagement.

 Students will be able to explain the importance of learning about dominant narratives and racism.
 Students will be able to articulate how studying the past helps us to better understand present day issues.
Criticality: How will my instruction inform students' views of power and equity and the disruption of oppression?  Students will be able to explain the importance of studying the structures of oppression that sustain racism.
Guiding Questions
1. Why is it important to study dominant narratives? 2. Why do we study the past to understand the present? 3. What are our personal responsibilities to combating prejudice and racism? How can we
achieve these goals?
Key Concepts and Terminology
� Reflection - serious thought and consideration about the past or things you have learned. � Responsibility - the state of being accountable for something. � Equity - the fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement for all people, with.
particular focus on eliminating barriers that have prevented the full participation of some groups.
In-Class Activities
1. The Hook - Revisit the quote by Chinua Achebe that students analyzed in Lesson 2: "Until the lions have their own historians, the story of the hunt will always glorify the hunter." Write the quote on the board and ask students to reread the reflective paragraph they wrote at the beginning of Lesson 2. Ask students to write a new paragraph that answers the following questions:  How has your understanding of this quote changed?  What does this quote mean to you when you think about the role of dominant narratives in contributing to racism? Ask students to share their answers.
2. Main Activity (Class Discussion) - The Main Activity centers around a reflective discussion about what students have learned over the past 13 lessons. As the class discusses the Discussion Questions (page 4), take notes on the board to capture students' main points. (Note: You may want to use this time to collect feedback from students about which

4
activities/exercises they enjoyed and which assignments they did not find particularly stimulating.)
3. Reflection - At the end of class, ask students to take 10 to 15 minutes to answer the lesson's Guiding Questions (page 3) in one or two paragraphs each.
4. Extension Activities - Here are some ideas for further student exploration:  Students each choose one lesson to create a video or podcast about. The video/podcast will highlight the main points of each lesson. Together, the class can create a mini-series to educate others about dominant narratives and racism.
Discussion Questions
Consolidating Knowledge Questions 1. What are dominant narratives and how do they benefit dominant groups and harm oppressed groups? 2. How did contemporary dominant narratives about ethnic groups originate? 3. Even though race is an illusion, why does it play such a big role in social relations? 4. What role(s) do education, media, and government play in shaping people's perspectives and attitudes toward others? 5. How do dominant narratives lead to interpersonal racism and structural racism? 6. What are counter narratives and how do they challenge dominant narratives? 7. How can individuals stand up to racism? 8. How can collective action stand up to racism?
Reflection Questions 9. What is one key takeaway that you took from this curriculum? 10. What is one thing you still wonder about? 11. What are some further areas of research you would like to conduct? 12. How do you plan to continue learning about dominant narratives and racism? 13. How do you plan to educate others on what you learned?
Homework
Students will use the Reflection Chart (page 6) to consolidate the main takeaways from each lesson so that they can easily refer to these notes in the future.
