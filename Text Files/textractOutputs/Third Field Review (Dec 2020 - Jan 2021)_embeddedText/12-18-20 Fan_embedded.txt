Dear sir/madam,
As a father of two girls, one is at 11 grade ma one is at 3 grade.
Surprised to learn the am rule will come into force. This is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our high school. And this will stimulate the hate between different races in America, it will divide us and make our children hate this country and hate our culture! I am totally against it!
This curriculum feels like it is more about imposing predigested political views on students than about widening their perspectives.
Do not make California become socialism place, your liberals!
