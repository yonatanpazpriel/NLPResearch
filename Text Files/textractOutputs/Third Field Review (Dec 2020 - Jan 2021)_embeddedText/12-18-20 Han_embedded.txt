From: Victoria Han Sent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 5:38 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Opposing changes to ESMC to be taught in our school!
To whom it may concern,
As a parent of California public school students, I strongly oppose the changes to EMSC to be taught in school. The changes encourage victimization and narrow the range of perspectives. It is exactly opposite to the education point of empowering our students to dream big and building mutual respect. Please consider my voice. Thank you!
