the Anti-Defamation League and the Jewish Community Relations Council don't speak for me. I object to the use of the IHRA definition and as a Jew I support an Ethnic Studies curriculum that centers the voices and experiences of communities of color and their social justice movements. AS a Jew, I am infuriated that right wing Zionists claim that they represent me. I am not antisemitic or a self hating Jew...I just don't hate and want to oppress or eliminate others like Zionists do. Enough is enough. You need to be on the right side of history. No more racism in my name. thank you, Nora Roman, RN San Francisco, CA
