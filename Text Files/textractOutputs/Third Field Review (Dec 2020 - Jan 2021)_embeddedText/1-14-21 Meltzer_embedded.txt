From: Susie Meltzer Sent: Thursday, January 14, 2021 7:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Draft of ESMC
I concur with the critiques from both ADL and Stand With Us in regard to including text in the ESMC curriculum describing and teaching about anti-Semitism. These are recommendations important to help students learn a fair and accurate understanding of the dangers of antiSemitism when misinformation is provided to our children. Please adapt these recommendations to your current draft to help change what anti-Semitism is doing to our children and our society. Susie Meltzer
