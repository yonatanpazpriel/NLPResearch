From: Karen Sager Sent: Saturday, January 9, 2021 5:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Fwd: CALIFORNIA ETHNIC STUDIES PROGRAM
> > To the State board of education, ethnic studies, my personal comments: > > The one thing I know for sure in this world, dear � educators �, is that if history is not taught completely, honestly, and with integrity for the truth, it has a way of repeating itself. > The 2,000 year history of the persecution of the Jewish people has affected me personally as a native San Franciscan, and my parents and husband, and I think that maybe you are not aware of this, or else you have decided that you don't give a damn. > > I am a native San Franciscan. My father was born in 1906 in San Francisco. > My grandparents came to San Francisco in 1900. That classifies me as an AMERICAN AND A CALIFORNIAN. I was educated in the public school system, and right after WW2, the whole world was profoundly ashamed at what they saw what was done to the Jewish people. Just watch one single film of Auschwitz, and your stomach will turn. That lasted for a short while. > > My best friend in John W. Geary Elementary School, on Euclid Avenue, was Kimmie, whom, after being inseparable from Kindergarten to 5th grade, came over one day to my home with a note saying, and I will never forget this: � I cannot be your friend any more, because the Jews killed Christ �. Goodbye. As a child, I did not understand what she was talking about and was devastated. > > After finishing Cal, I went to work for Metropolitan Life as an underwriter trainee along with other graduates from university of California, Berkeley, and I had the misfortune of sitting next to a girl from Iowa, who informed me that Jews had horns, and where was mine. Then, at lunch in front of the other graduates, when we were talking about WW2, she blurted out, � why didn't Hitler just finish the job and kill all the Jews? � I quit my job that very day. > > Our parents, born in San Francisco, were not allowed to join the Commonwealth Club in the 50's, 60's, or 70's, because they were Jewish. > > Our home in Kent Woodlands, bought in the 1970's, had on the title deed: � no Jews or Orientals allowed to purchase in Kent Woodlands �, now crossed out because it was now illegal, but there it was, in black and white! > > My husband grew up in Virginia, passing signs that said: � NO JEWS OR DOGS ALLOWED ON THE GRASS �. He was beat up daily in both grammar school and middle school because the boys could gang up on the � Jew �. > > Anti-s�mitism does not go away by ignoring it, distorting the past, or just not even studying the seeds of ethic discrimination when it comes to the age-old most discriminated people on earth for 2000 years, but you, dear � educators �, have decided -what?-that we don't deserve to be spoken about, the Holocaust never happened, and you cannot see with your own eyes that there are now several VERBALLY OPEN ANTI-SEMITES IN OUR VERY OWN United States Congress, being ELECTED? > > I implore you to rethink your ethnic studies program. Why not start with showing the made for children educational film, PAPER CLIPS, so children can discuss what it means to kill 6,000,000 of the same ethic group, 1.5 million of them that were only children? As educators, I am certain that you know intimately about this film which, with the cooperation of the Principals of high schools and middle schools of Napa County and the Principals of middle schools of Marin County, I have shown to over 5000 students, preceded by the studying in history of the

Holocaust, followed by two German Christian speakers who were involved in the making of this amazing film? The classes each year could attempt to collect paper clips to see what 6 million looks like. Then they can study the Holocaust, how discrimination begins insidiously, and how it climbs up the ladder until it gets to the government that ignores it, is apathetic to it, and does nothing about it at all until it is TOO LATE. Did you know that Redwood High School in Kentfield is having severe anti-semitism among the students? Yikes, this is where our son attended high school!
> But you would know this, because you are educators in a position of power who are writing ethnic curriculum to stop discrimination, correct? > > I hope to hear that there will be significant changes in your ethnic studies curriculum very soon. And in regard to Israel, you had better study up yourselves. There are Arab Muslims in every walk of life in Israel, including the courts and in their Congress (Knesset). Israel is but a mere dot on the earth to protect those who have lived with life-long hatred and discrimination in every country in this world, the safe haven to run to when educators decide that the Jewish people are not ethnic enough to be studied. Like I said, history has a way of repeating itself. > > Sincerely, > Mrs. Karen Sager [address redacted] > Napa, California
