From: Anna Krylov Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Expanded public comment on the 2021 Californial Ethnic Studies Model Curiculum
To: Members of the Instructional Quality Commission (IQC) and the State Board of Education.
I strongly oppose the 2021 California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I am particularly alarmed by its attempt to depict inter-ethnic relationships as a irreconcilable struggle between racially-defined "oppressed" and oppressors" and by the way it associates "whiteness" with "oppression" and "colonialism".
I grew up in Soviet Russia and I recognize that this rhetoric closely follows Soviet-era propaganda. It is not based on any reality and takes us back instead of forward, by encouraging division instead of unity and by shifting our attention to made-up issues instead of real ones.
It is biased and untrue, as described in this short letter: https://calmatters.org/commentary/my-turn/2020/12/4-forms-of-bias-to-avoid-in-designing-ethnicstudies-for-high-schools/?utm_medium=email&mc_cid=782b252933&mc_eid=1bdaa22dc1
Sincerely -Dr. Anna Krylov Professor of Chemistry
