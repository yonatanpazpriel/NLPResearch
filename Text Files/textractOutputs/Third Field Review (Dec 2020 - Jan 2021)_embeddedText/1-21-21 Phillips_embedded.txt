From: Akili Phillips Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:05 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Good morning, I was disturbed and disappointed to learn of the new proposed ethnic studies curriculum that portrays Jewish people as wealthy, privileged oppressors. This interpretation is dangerous, inaccurate and would contribute to the antisemitism already present in this country. Please reconsider.
Sincerely, Akili Phillips
