From: Kathy Sellers Sent: Sunday, December 20, 2020 3:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Review process
As a lifelong Californian who raised three children educated by our public education system (one of those children is now a 3rd grade teacher), I beseech the commission to stop the approval process of the current Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
While the goal is laudable, the unfair depiction of America's failings will cause a disastrous decades-long effect on our society. We still need some serious revisions to the current model, most importantly because of the damage being done to our democracy at present. Why rush this most important learning tool for our young minds? Once millions are spent on integrating the new curriculum, we will be stuck with it for decades, even when shown to be faulty.
I have followed the progress of this state-developed curriculum and appreciate the changes thus far, but the final edit is far from complete.
