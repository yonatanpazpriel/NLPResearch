I am writing to express my concern for the way jews may be represented in the curriculum. I have heard there is wording about privilege and name changing - is this what you want to say about Jews? Please consider wording. We are starting with a new president and hopeful that we can all get along and accept our differences with kindness and love. Karen sugar
