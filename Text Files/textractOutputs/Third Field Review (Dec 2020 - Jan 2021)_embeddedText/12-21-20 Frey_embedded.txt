From what I have heard about your Model Curriculum, it teaches that American history consists mainly of slavery. I and most citizens agree that students should be taught about slavery and other negative aspects of American history, but they should be taught the positives as well. It seems like the educational establishment wants to only teach the negative aspects and to teach children to be ashamed of being American.
And then educators wonder why there isn't more support for public education...
