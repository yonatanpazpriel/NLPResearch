From: Rudkin, George M.D. Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 10:11 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
I am strongly against the adoption of critical race theory and intersectionality in our schools.
I will not have my children indoctrinated in this fashion, and will remove my children from the public school system (and likely leave the state) if implemented
Regards George Rudkin
