From: Lisa Levy Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:04 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Changes to the Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I would like to thank the SBE for doing the right thing and removing the earlier draft of the ethnic studies curriculum that included antisemitic bias and including two lesson plans on Jewish Americans and references to antisemitism. I do think that the class is still incomplete and NEEDS to add ADL's lesson BINAH ï¿½ Building Insights to Navigate Antisemitism and Hate. In addition, it is critical that the SBE use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's complete definition of antisemitism, which the European Union and U.S State Department adopted during the Obama Administration. Jewish people all over the world are frequent subjects of hate crimes and discrimination. In the US, the instances of hate toward Jewish Americans have been on the rise over the past four years. If we are to be true to the intentions of the ethnic studies curriculum- we MUST look at bias and hate in all of it's forms. It seems that Antisemitism and anti Muslim rhetoric are the last two accepted forms of hate in our country. If we don't approach this head in, AND without bias in the curriculum, as the previous draft lacked, we will do even more damage.
Thank you,
