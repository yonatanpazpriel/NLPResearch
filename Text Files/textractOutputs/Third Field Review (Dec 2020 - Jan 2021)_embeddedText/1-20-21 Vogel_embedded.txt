From: Rachel Vogel Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:34 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Representation of Jewish People in Proposed Curriculum
The overt nexus of "Jews" with "privilege" in the proposed curriculum effectuates a perpetuation of anti-semitic sentiment, whether intentional or not, and therefore counts as destructive indoctrination. Please, please revise in consultation with the Anti-Defamation League or other appropriate Jewish organizations.
