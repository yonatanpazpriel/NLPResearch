From: nitza sarner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 2:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Treatment of Jews
I find the treatment of Jews in the curriculum very odd. It seems that the people who wrote this treatment have no idea who Jews are and what 'Ethnic' group they belong to. Since the Babylonian expulsion of Jews and the Roman destruction of the 2nd temple and even before that there were Jews living all over the world, in India, they were brown, in North Africa they looked like their neighbours, the same as the Jews who were scattered in Europe, china, and other diasporas, so to call them by any colour is erroneous. The fact that they kept their identity in the face of all the discriminations, expulsions, genocides and other treatments, is miraculous. So, to give them a special treatment is bizarre in the extreme. They are human beings and mostly successful ones, that integrated into their many communities and contributed much to those communities. If some ethnic groups don't like them, it shouldn't influence their position in definition vis-a-vis their classification in today strange and divisive 'classification'. Nitza Sarner
