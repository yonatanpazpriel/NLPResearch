From: Patrick&Paula Murphy Sent: Saturday, January 9, 2021 9:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum comments
As long time residents of California, and former school teachers, we are appalled by the content of the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. To paint a picture of this state and/or country as a place where minorities are unjustly oppressed and held down by a racist society is a totally one-sided picture. In a true democracy, BOTH sides of any issue must be presented and discussed in an open and hopefully objective way. This proposed Curriculum does just the opposite. We would much more favor a Curriculum which points out both the good and bad that has occurred over the past. But to present only one side does a complete disservice to residents of this state, and taints an already biased picture of how we treat or should be treating immigrants to this great state and Country. We sincerely hope you will be able to step back and look to develop a Curriculum which is less influenced by special interest groups and a vocal minority of residents and/or educators. Real progress can only be made when all parties are brought to the table and open and free review can take place.
