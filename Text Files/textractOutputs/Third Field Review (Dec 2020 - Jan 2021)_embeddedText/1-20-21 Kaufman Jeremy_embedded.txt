The content promotes antisemitism. The content fails to recognize that in the last 100 years including today there are more hate crimes against Jews than any other minority. The leader of Iran is openly antisemitic saying he wants to annihilate Jews in the Middle East. In America nobody helped Jews when they were penniless refugees after world war two. Today nobody helps poor Jews. The curriculum claims Jews receive white privilege which is nuts. Jews receive prejudice by whites and minorities. Palestinians complain about Jews building houses and apartments in the West Bank because living next to a Jew is objectionable and prevents peace. Take out the word Jew and put in black. If people complained about black people living in their neighborhood would the United Nations side with the group that wants to exclude blacks? This should be taught in ethnic studies. The prejudice against Jews by the UN dwarfs prejudice against other minorities. If you in denial of the truth wake up. The ethnic studies program needs to devote a great deal of time to studying the holocaust.
