To whom it may concern:
I recently learned of the proposed language for your ethnic study program. I am saddened by the use of this language to describe Jews as privileged. in any way and to divide Jews based on color. My parents came here in 1980 to flee the Iranian revolution. As Jews living in the City of Isfahan, Iran, they saw the writing on the wall when several of their Jewish friends were jailed or killed for no reason. I was born one month after they came here. They left with nothing and started from scratch. I lived in a studio apartment in Long Beach for the first few years of my life, along with my brother. I was raised in Orange County, and was constantly picked on for being Jewish and Middle Eastern. In college, I was constantly belittled and made to feel uncomfortable by not just other students, but by professors as well. All for my religious beliefs.
This is the story of almost every single Jewish person in the United States. All of them came here fleeing hatred and all of them have felt hatred in various degrees in their life.
Please don't contribute to the anti-semitism and the stereotypes of Jews that already exist out there. It is your job to protect all of us. We are no different that any other minority group that came here fleeing persecution.
Please do the right thing and correct the language.
Thank you.
