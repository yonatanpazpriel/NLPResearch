From: JW Sent: Monday, December 14, 2020 3:15 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ethnic study curriculum comments
Our high school students can elect ethnic studies course from community colleges. There is NO need to implement a "new" ethnic study in high school using tax payer's money. A total waste. And this course is just another promotion of critical race theory that California parents are fed up with.
Some specific comments:
Per https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/esmcthirdfieldreview.asp
The first file: The Model Curriculum (preface)(DOCX)
1. Line 19, the first person, Elizabeth Arzate, there is a legal case back in 2003,https://trellis.law/case/1102707/People-of-the-State-of-California-vs-Elizabeth-Arzate Is she the same person. What was she being sued with? Does she have the qualification to be on this curriculum?
2. Line 38, 39. it states the ethnic study can be either stand alone or integrated into current social study. Not sure if we can argue it to be integrated so the contents can be minimal
3. Line 45-47. it states the district can develop its own curriculum to reflect the students demographic distributions. So in our school district, we have dominant asian population, we should add more asian american history instead of black. And we should add the oppression from all race/ethniciites to Asian to be equitable. For example, the history about Murder of Chinese immigrants by other minority groups such as Hispanic (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_massacre_of_1871). This will directly invalidate the so-called privilege or power classification based on race.
