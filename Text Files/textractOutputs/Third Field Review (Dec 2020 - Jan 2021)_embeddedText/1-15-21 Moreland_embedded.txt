Dear Mr. Thurmond & CDE,
I am writing to formally oppose the so-called "ethnic studies" program you are trying to force onto our children in elementary school. Critical Race Theory is bigotry cloaked as moral high ground and I will not subject my children to this garbage. At best, make it an extracurricular choice for parents who are interested.
You are using the color of a child's skin to either guilt them for history that is not their fault, or convince them they are victims. Congratulations!
While you have devoted money and resources to this ethnic studies program, California education is failing our children by sitting them in front of an iPad all day where they learn absolutely nothing. The curriculum is a JOKE. I am basically homeschooling my children while they stay enrolled in school because otherwise they'd be years behind their expected academic level. Perhaps you should pull your head out of the sand and devote these resources to the basics that are sorely so lacking.
Regards. Sheila Moreland
