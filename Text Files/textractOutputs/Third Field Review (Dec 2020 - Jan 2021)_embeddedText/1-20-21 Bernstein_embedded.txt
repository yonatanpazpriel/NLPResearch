Putting so much focus on defining groups of people by ways easiest to use in example and practice of racism should be looked upon as the views of the past not the future. This curriculum is more likely to reinforce the foundations racism is built upon than it is to dismantle them. With your choice to teach children that people are divided into the historically opposed racial groups you take away their ability to build a world without them
