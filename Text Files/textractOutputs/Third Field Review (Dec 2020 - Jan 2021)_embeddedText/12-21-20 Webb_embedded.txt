As a 78 year old it breaks my heart to see how we are training young people to hate our country. While no country has a perfect history the United States has offered more opportunity for people of all races and backgrounds to reach their full potential more than any other country in the world. Rather than highlighting the success and achievements of many individuals in the minority community it looks like your program teaches people that they are victims. At my age I will not be around to see the results of your efforts to divide our country along racial lines.
