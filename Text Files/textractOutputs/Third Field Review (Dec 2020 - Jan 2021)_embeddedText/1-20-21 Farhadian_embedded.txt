I can not believe what I just read.
Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term 'privilege' is used.
As antisemitism in this country soars, As attacks on Jews in this country have become deadly, As white supremacists storm the Capitol wearing "Camp Auschwitz" shirts, As synagogues in this country are vandalized, including mine As high school kids an hour south of me made TikToks with Nazi signs...
... California is proposing teaching its public school students that Jews are "privileged."
Shame on those of you promoting hate!
