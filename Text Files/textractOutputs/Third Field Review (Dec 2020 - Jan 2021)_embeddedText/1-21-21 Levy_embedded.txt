From: Samantha Sklar Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish curriculum
To whom it may concern:
The current draft of the curriculum celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting "Jews of color" against Jews who are tarred with "conditional whiteness" and its attendant "racial privilege."
This is shameful. It is divisive. It is damaging I cannot seem to wrap my head around why one would choose to teach hate like this, racist ideas, further alienating people of any group.
Learning about, and celebrating our differences is what people need. Pointing fingers and demonising people is abhorrent. When will this end? When?!
I implore you to teach without politically LOADED language. Let children learn about the e beauty of our differences. Allow their experiences to shape their beliefs.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
