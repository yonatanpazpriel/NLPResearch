From: Jan Keith Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:37 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed MANDATORY Ethnic Studies curriculum is FLAWED
I read the relevant portions of the proposed content of the state ethnic studies curriculum & I am, at the very least, concerned if not downright appalled at the insensitive, biased, vacuous way in which Jews are portrayed in this proposed curriculum. Referring ONLY to Jews as privileged is nothing more than perpetuating a false narrative that has been around for ages.
Get the facts straight. Be honest. Stop fueling the current fashionable, acceptable anti-Semitism that has bolstered bigots & hatemongerers for millenia.
Shame on you! Jan Keith
