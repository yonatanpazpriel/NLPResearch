Dear Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board of Education, and Superintendent Tony Thurmond, As an educator, I object to the ESMC because the Guiding Principles which are based on critical race theory are flawed and need to be revised. By emphasizing race, it tries to divide our students on the basis of "whiteness," "racial privilege," and "supremacy" and asks students to think in terms of victimhood and marginalization instead of emphasizing equal opportunity for all. Please eliminate vocabulary such as oppression, privilege, whiteness, and marginalization. Instructional materials, according to CA Education Codes must not "contain any matter reflecting upon persons on the basis of race," and educators must promote "harmonious relations" in the classroom and not foster "discriminatory bias on the basis of race."
Examples of this hurtful, harmful, and divisive language are found in Lesson 41, where Jewish students will be made to feel uncomfortable
Page 506 Line 10650 Descendants of Jewish immigrants often assimilated and changed their position onthe racial hierarchy from their immigrant parents, gaining racialprivilege.
Line 10959 Light-skinned Jews simultaneously experience white privilege on the basis of their, appearance and prejudice, discrimination, and systematic antisemitism on the basis of their Jewishness. Please revise this draft, which promotes racism, victimhood, and marginalization, to one of inclusivity, tolerance and appreciation of the values and achievements of other ethnic groups.
