Taking a page from Nazi Germany these proposals pretend to use science to propagandize against people the authors do not like. And this is a proposal for a generation of Americans in a school system?
The horror.
Perhaps the authors of this "proposal" would do well to take history and biology classes.
This is a joke. That California is even considering this drivel should be a loud alarm to citizens of the state.
If this proposal does pass, however, it will certainly reduce the population of folks with integrity in this state.
