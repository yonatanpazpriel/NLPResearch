Dear mad'am or sir,
Accoring to an article in the California Family Consel News by By Greg Burt "President Donald Trump has ignited a national debate about Critical Race Theory (CRT), after he recently banned his federal agencies and federal contractors from teaching this ideology as part of employee diversity training. Trump called CRT a "malign ideology" that "threatens to infect core institutions of our country" because it teaches, among other things, "that men and members of certain races, as well as our most venerable institutions, are inherently sexist and racist."
I am in complete agreement and stand highly opposed to the critical race theory curriculum being taught or mandated at our public schools as it truly appears to be based on an unproven narrative of systemic racism to divide people into oppressors and victims based on skin color.
It is is my sound opinion that there far too many biases as well as inaccurate information already being taught which has only led to the increased division within the United States of America. This cirriculum only creates a greater divide.
Any agenda / indocrintaion that seeks to divide this nation of PEOPLE is unacceptable and when you force our teachers to use this cirriculum, you not only promote divisiveness, through grouping people based on race, you aremandating it and this is ablsoletly not acceptable.
I emplore you to reject this cirrculum.
Sincerely, Barbara Luther
