I cannot support this curriculum, while some content may be enlightening and positive, much will drive a wedge between our students, families and communities.
When you teach that there is value in the Black Lives Matter movement you lose your credibility. I am not talking about the riots, fires, vandalism, intimidation that this movement and its political supporters condone and encourage, all of which are despicable and ILLEGAL. I am talking about the fact that they support a change to a Communist form of Government in the United States. They do not believe in the nuclear family! That really is troublesome. Rhetoric you say? NO, these are guiding principles stated on their own website.
I would encourage the State Department of Education put more effort in BRINGING OUR STUDENTS TOGETHER. There is much value teaching that all cultures and races bring value to the human experience!! I support that.
A guiding principle of teaching LOVE and UNITY, not division, animosity or hate will bring a positive outcome to our Society.
This material is largely agenda driven, not what I would support in its current form.
