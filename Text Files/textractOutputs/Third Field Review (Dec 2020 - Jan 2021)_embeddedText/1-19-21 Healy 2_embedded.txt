Dear Department of Education,
Thank you for allowing public comment on CRT being taught in California classrooms. Critical Race Theory is the least objective way of thinking. Aren't we supposed to teach our kids how to be objective? CRT divides individuals into groups of either "oppressors" or "oppressed". It defines its theory in terms of race, class and sexual orientation over individual ability. We must teach our children character formation instead.
Education should be committed to individual and communal flourishing, pursuit of excellence in scientific discovery, artistic work, shared inquiry and civic responsibility. NOT if your white then you are inherently racist. CRT will no doubt make a terrible mess of our kids. It will go on to divide even more than we are now.
You should do some historical research in where CRT originated. Critical pedagogy is grounded in the teachings of Antonio Gramsci, the founder of Ital's Communist Party in the 1920's. He used education to advance socialism by imposing a "counter-narrative" that would produce students who were ready to install a socialist revolution.
Please reconsider this ill advised curriculum.
Regards,
Maura Healy
