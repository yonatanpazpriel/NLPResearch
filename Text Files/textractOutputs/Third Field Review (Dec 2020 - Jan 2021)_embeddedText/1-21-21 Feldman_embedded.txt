From: Marilyn Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:38 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Curriculum section on Jews
To whom it may concern Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term privilege is used. There ought to be no discussion about Jews and privilege that doesn't begin by talking about the historically enacted and repeated genocidal ideology that revolves around Jews and privilege. For an ethnic studies curriculum to go traipsing through that discord without a single mention of his ugly and bloody history is not a lesson about anti-Semitism it is a repetition of it by itself that should effectuate a vote of no confidence in the entire franchise. In the midst Of the largest recorded surge in anti-Semitic propaganda and attacks against Jewish people across the globe, a new framework for racial theory again counts Jews as members of the evil class. Jews, who represent roughly .2% of the worlds population and roughly 2% of the US population are again targeted for their privilege. Yet,When concerns are raised about the Ways In which critical ethnic studies programs promote this type of hatred, the authors of rethinking ethnic studies write, such strong feelings are Part of students sense making and development. Indeed, it promotes more anti semitism. Please please rewrite your curriculum! Yours Truly Marilyn Feldman Palm Desert
