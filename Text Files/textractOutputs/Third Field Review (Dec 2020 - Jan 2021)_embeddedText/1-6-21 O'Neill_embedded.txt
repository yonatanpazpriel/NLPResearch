From: Neil O'Neill Sent: Tuesday, January 5, 2021 11:54 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Draft 01/05/2021 Neil O'Neill
As an English teacher having worked in the Cal schools for 15+ years, I write to support the content and curriculum developed in the ESMC draft before you now. Having taught Holocaust studies. it became clear to me that deeper and objective, critical thinking was needed in the classroom. around bias, and especially anti-semitism. Students then were then able to approach the special predicament faced by members of the Jewish community and other minorities, with unbiased, informed eyes. Given the rise of anti-semitism here, and around the world, I feel it timely that we provide our students the skills and unbiased content to separate fact from bias, and so, I ask for your support in implementing the ESMC content into full use in our schools. It's solid implementation will establish a sound formal baseline of fact and practice that can result in mutual understanding between everyone. Thank you for your kind and wise support now!
