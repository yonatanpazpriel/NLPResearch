From: edward halfon Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:43 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies regarding jews
To whom this may concern,
In an age of rising anti-semitism and a history of it, there is never any privilege in being jewish.
Your choice in describing jews must be balanced. It cannot claim jews are privileged in any way.
I cannot say it any stronger than to point out that the vast majority of jews are hard working citizens who contribute positively to society.
Labeling jews as privileged is historically a gateway to promoting antisemetic behavior.
As a public body, you must protect the jewish students and community from this kind of labeling.
There is no excuse for doing otherwise.
Respectfully submitted,
Edward M Halfon
