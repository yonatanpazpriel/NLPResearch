Dear Sir:
The ADL's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is excellent and should be incorporated into the California Public School Curriculum.
The previous drafts left huge gaps in terms of antisemitism and consideration of the Jewish community. Please correct this and continued success with what you are doing. Sincerely, Rabbi Thomas P. Liebschutz, DD, D.MIn
