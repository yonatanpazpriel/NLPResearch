From: Judith Herzog Sent: Thursday, January 7, 2021 8:02 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear SBE Members,
I would like to thank you for listening to my concern regarding the Israeli and Jewish American community here in California around the topic of the Ethnic Studies curriculum and for the revisions that have been made accordingly.
I stand by the IQC's final product, however would like to reiterate the importance of our demands:
1. I think it is imperative to include a definition of antisemitism in the glossary for teachers to refer to, along with a link to the official IHRA definition of antisemitism - https://www.holocaustremembrance.com/working-definition-antisemitism
2. Please ensure that the finalized curriculum does not contain any BDS or antisemitism, like the content that was previously removed.
3. I ask that you remove mentions of historical figures that engaged in antisemitic rhetoric or behavior.
I appreciate my right as a California constituent to influence my children's' education, and with the power vested in the CDE I ask that you continue to act on your responsibility to give an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps.
Thank you,
