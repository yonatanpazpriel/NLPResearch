I'm a product of California public schools, representing my 4 children. I love the diversity of our state and agree that there is always room for improvement in the excellence of teaching. However, it will be a sad future for this languishing state if our next generations are indoctrinated to believe you are inherently victimized or an evil oppressor because of your skin color. I'm absolutely against CRT becoming the religion of our schools. Please ethically aim much higher for an actual academic education, not just the next destructive fad. Thanks for listening, Jeanene Ayles
