From: Janet S. Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 11:16 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] RE: Jewish Studies
To Whom it May Concern.
I write this to whom it may concern, but I wonder if you are really concerned at all.
Creating a false narrative about a culture of a religion that has survived 5781 years is beyond comprehension.
The fact is that Jews have historically put their greatest efforts in education. Jewish children study the torah and learn a new language for the reciting of their Bar Mitzvah. Studying is hard. Working for achievements is hard. Is the hatred of the Jews because they put learning and charity at the top of their daily rituals? This makes us "privileged"?
Are other cultures jealous of the commitments Jews make to themselves and their community and feel the need to tear them down?
Think hard about creating labels for people you don't know or understand. History books should be fact filled and written by those knowledgable of those facts.
While creating a curriculum of studies, take some time and visit the Holocaust Museum and talk to some learned scholars at any of the over 128 synagogues in the Los Angeles area.
As someone who has been personally attacked for being Jewish, everyone in education should be careful what is printed about any other human's religion or belief system.
Speak the truth. Knowledge is king.
