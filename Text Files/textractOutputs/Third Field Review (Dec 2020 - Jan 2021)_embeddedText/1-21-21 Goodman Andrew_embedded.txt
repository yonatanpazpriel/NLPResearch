From: Andrew Goodman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:48 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Sirs,
I am writing to express my concern at the present draft of the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which I understand appears on its face to repeat without qualification anti-semitic tropes in its Fact Sheet on Jewish American Diversity that properly belong in a bygone era, and lauds figures who have promoted anti-Semitism. What is proposed offends common decency and common sense, and there is no academic virtue in merely engaging "strong feelings (as) part of students' sense-making and development (Rethinking Ethnic Studies)"
I was alerted to this issue only today, but will raise the matter at an institutional level in the UK through our Parliament should the CDE proceed with this curriculum in its present form. Critical ethnic studies programmes should not be used to promote this type of hatred by disguise, and to divorce academic analysis from its proper historic context suggests that CDE has a political agenda which is ugly.
