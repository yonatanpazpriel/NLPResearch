Dear Sir /Madam,
The ESMC is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our high school and very concerned about your decision in implementing this course in California public schools.
This curriculum feels like it is more about imposing predigested political views on students than about widening their perspective. Our kids need to be taught how to unite together to build our great country and should not be taught how people are different with these narrow views and wrong beliefs. Please don't instill these political biased views and teach these meaningless courses to our kids.
Thank you Linlin
