Please look again at the curriculum for the `ethnic/religion' portions that remain, referring to Jews and Israel. As a woman educated in California, a grand-daughter of an immigrant, a daughter of a California educator and Dean, and aunt of elementary school teachers, I am stunned at the contents in the curriculum. There is a great dearth of information remaining, along with political and ethnic bias. Isn't it time to say `Never again'? Please include historians of Jewish history and culture, along with consultation from the ADL, to provide edits for unbiased and informative content based on facts. Don't let another child being told hateful things not even knowing why- it happened to me. Let us teach the positive history and culture of all Americans, so each student feels included in the beautiful tapestry of the people of California, and USA. Thank you for your service to the constituents of this wonderful State- it is a privilege to have grown up here and live here. Sincerely, Elaine Schlackman-Lebowitz Los Angeles, CA
