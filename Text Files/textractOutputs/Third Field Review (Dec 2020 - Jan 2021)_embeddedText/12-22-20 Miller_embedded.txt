Congratulations on adding a section on Jewish studies to the curriculum, especially the section on Mizrahi Jews.
I did notice that the bibliography is on the light side, and should be expanded if the students are going to be able to address the questions asked in the proposed exercises. Some suggestions are:
1. Stillman, Norman, The Jews of Arab Lands, a History and Source Book, Jewish Publication Society of America, Philadelphia,1979.
2. Stillman, Norman, The Jews of Arab Lands in Modern Times, Jewish Publication Society, Philadelphia,1991.
3. Baldwin, Neil, Henry Ford and the Jews, The Mass Production of Hate, Public Affairs, New York, 2001.
4. Schama, Simon, The Story of the Jews, Belonging 1492-1900, Harper Collins, New York, 2017.
5. Lipstadt, Deborah, Antisemitism Here and Now, Random House, New York, 2019.
6. Weiss, Bari, How to Fight Anti-Semitism, Crown Publishing, New York, 2019.
