It is disheartening to know that our beautiful but highly taxed state has come to: adopting this kind of content for our schools and targeting our Jewish brothers and sisters. Do count us out in our support of this. Whatever happened to "the content of one's character"? I do hope that is not outdated yet. Kathleen Sanglier
