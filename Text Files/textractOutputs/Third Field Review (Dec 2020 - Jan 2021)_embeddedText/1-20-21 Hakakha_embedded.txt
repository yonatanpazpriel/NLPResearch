I am disturbed and saddened to hear about how the proposed curriculum celebrates known anti semites and classifies some Jews as privileged. No distinction can be made between Jews. The idea of classifying some as white and some as people of color is a fantasy. Are you looking to breed more anti semitism? My temple in Los Angeles was just vandalized. Do you want more of this? What is the point of your new curriculum? I seriously hope this doesn't occur and can't believe that in 2021 I am sending an email like this.
