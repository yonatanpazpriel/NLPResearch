From: Rhona Wang Sent: Saturday, December 19, 2020 5:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Objection to Ethnic Studies
I'm a parent of 2 small children. I'm Hispanic myself. However, after learning about the Ethnic Study curriculum being promoted by California Department of education, I'm absolutely not on board with having my children being force fed these ideas.
I'm worried that the ethnic studies are not teaching children ways of resolving racial issues and bringing about racial harmony; instead it will promote more division and hatred towards other races and ethnic groups in turn worsening the problem of racism. This is NOT the way to unite and better our country!
I have always been a democrat leaning independent, but if policies like this do not stop I and many people like myself will be forced to support the effort to recall Gavin Newsome and vote against the California Democrats.
Sincerely,
Daffiney Hernandez
