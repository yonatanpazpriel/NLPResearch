From: Steven Lackner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:37 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Fw: Stop this Ethnics Studies Curriculum!!!
Regarding the Ethnics Studies curriculum,
The Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in its current draft celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are nonwhite (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting "Jews of color" against Jews who are tarred with "conditional whiteness" and its attendant "racial privilege."
My grandparents and great-grandparents were Holocaust survivors. I heard the horrific and most tragic stories first-hand. I have always stood for liberty and justice for all. But how can equality for all mean targeting the Jewish people with a narrative that is so destructive? This divisive curriculum needs to be stopped. Why pit Jew against Jew? Why pit Jew against non-Jew? Why pit white against non-white? Why pit one group of Californians against another? Why teach divisiveness instead of fostering togetherness? I implore you, STOP IT! Act like mature adults, not political ideologues. This is ever so disgraceful. What has my great dear Golden State become. I shed tears on the road ahead.
Very respectfully,
