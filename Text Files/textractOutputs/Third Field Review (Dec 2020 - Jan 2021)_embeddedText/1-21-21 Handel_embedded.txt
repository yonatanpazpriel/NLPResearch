I an absolutely incensed and furious at the references to Jews in the proposed CA curriculum. This is racist! It proposes white supremacy as the study guide for California education. You must stop and reconsider, get input from experts in the field. Or are you advocating for another Charlottesville- with good people "on all sides"?
