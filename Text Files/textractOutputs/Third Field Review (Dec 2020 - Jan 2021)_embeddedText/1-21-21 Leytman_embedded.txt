To whom it may concern,
I would like to voice my opposition to this curriculum. While I would like to extend the benefit of the doubt as to the true motivations behind this proposal to be well intentioned, I cannot help but be very concerned about it's ultimate outcome. There is no clear benefit, as far as I can see, to this direction within our schools in California. My family has lived through a lot, from it's Jewish persecution, living through a Soviet Russian regime, and to the hardships of abandoning everything and everyone to migrate to the United States. We come to this country to leave behind the discrimination that made life difficult. Please do not inject this into our children's education and spur hatred and resentment.
Even amongst my non Jewish Russian friends and family, being Jewish can be considered derogatory. Being of Jewish descent is something, during my childhood, I would avoid sharing in the wrong crowd. It's insulting to be considered "of privilege" when even amongst the people who share your language and culture, you feel like an outsider.
I do not wish to be perceived as a victim for the hardships faced by myself and many I know. This is meant to serve as an opportunity to whoever is considering this curriculum to reconsider and choose to unite rather than divide.
Best Regards, Polina
