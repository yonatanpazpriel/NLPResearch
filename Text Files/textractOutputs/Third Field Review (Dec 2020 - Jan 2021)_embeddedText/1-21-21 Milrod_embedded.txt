Hello,
I want to thank you for amending this curriculum to remove content that created anti-Israel bias that leads to antisemitism. Currently I see an increase in antisemitism on both the far right and the far left that troubles me greatly. If more education about Jewish History could be included that could foster understanding and tolerance, that would be even better.
Kind regards, Lara-Miya
