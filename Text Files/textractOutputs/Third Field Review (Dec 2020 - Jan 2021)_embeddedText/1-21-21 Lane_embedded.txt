To Whom It May Concern:
The proposed ESMC is divisive, racist, misleading, and sometimes outright false political propaganda that has no place in the classroom. For example, one lesson plan states:
Students will be exposed to contemporary discussions around policing in the US, specifically police brutality cases where unarmed African Americans have been killed.
This lesson appears to be premised on the falsehood that there is an epidemic of racist police shootings of unarmed black men in the U.S.
Please keep your politics out of the classroom. Thank you.
