From: Schiller, Gary M.D. Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California
To Whom It May Concern:
I would like to register my concerns about the Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California as now proposed. The curriculum refers to leaders with a history of anti-Semitic statements and positions hostile to the Jewish community. By including such figures, the curriculum proposed aligns itself with anti-Jewish and anti-Zionist positions antithetical to the values of our State.
