Dear Superintendent Thurmond, California Department of Education, Instructional Quality Commission and State Board of Education,
At the formal request of CDE officials, we write to provide feedback on sample lesson plans which refer to the Sikh American community, to be entered into the public record for the ESMC third draft field review:
Sample Lesson 30: Indian American Diaspora, Myths of the Model Minority Sample Lesson 33: South Asian Americans in the United States Sample Lesson 34: Building Empathy Sample Lesson 35: Xenophobic Racism Against South Asians and Muslims: Past & Present
Suggested line edits for these lessons can be found in the respective WORD attachments. We have reached out to Monisha Bajaj and API School Board Members Association, the authors of these lesson plans, to inform them that we would be submitting suggestions to you. We have not heard back from APISBMA yet about lesson 30, but Monisha did let us know that she is fully supportive of our suggestions pertaining to lessons 33, 34 and 35.
Please do not hesitate to reach out for any additional queries around our suggestions.
Satjeet Kaur Executive Director The Sikh Coalition
Deep Singh Executive Director The Jakara Movement
