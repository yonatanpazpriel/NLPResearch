This is a screen grab from the internet from a couple days ago. This man spewing nazi poison from his moth is a lawyer in Los Angeles. Jewish people have to deal wi to seeing stuff like this on the internet everyday. There is no such thing as Jewish privilege. We are not considered "white" by our enemies. We are not safe in our places of worship. We haven't been safe from antisemitic violence anywhere throughout history except Israel. You must remove this antisemitic propaganda from the proposed curriculum that perpetuates harmful anti Jewish tropes. The Jewish people need the protection that any other marginal group has. This curriculum must do better and tell the Jewish story with honesty and empathy. It must honor the Holocaust victims. It must also give a fair unbiased account of Israel, where half of the world's Jewish population lives protected from white supremacists, neo nazis, and all dangerous antisemitics.
