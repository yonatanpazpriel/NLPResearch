From: Viktor Stolc Sent: Friday, January 1, 2021 4:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comments on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
In response to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC): It is offensive, divisive and discriminatory to divide people into groups by race and attributes based on color of skin. It is unacceptable to be characterized as an oppressor or a victim based on race. I object to pay taxes for such vile information to be imposed on my kids. Do not even try to teach such garbage in my schools, or you all will be voted out of your government jobs, recalled and prosecuted to the full extent of the law for malpractice and child abuse.
