Good afternoon,
On behalf of the educators who have written Sample Lesson Plan 18 on Pacific Islanders in the United States, we would like to bring attention to a typo in this lesson plan that we were not previously aware of.
Please see below: Appendix A: Sample Lessons and Topics Sample Lesson Plan 18 Line � 3467 � replace "eastern" islands to "western." The corrected language should read 3467 Germans had influence in the western islands, and the US would maintain 3468. influence in the eastern islands. The US Navy wanted to utilize Pago Pago
This is a minor edit but essential in providing geographically and historically accurate info in the ESMC.
Thank you, Levalasi Loi-On
