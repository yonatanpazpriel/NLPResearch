From: Bill Moran Sent: Sunday, December 27, 2020 5:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Thank you for your latest revisions!
Just wanted to say that I appreciated your latest revisions to the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and the critical addition of sample lessons reflecting the diversity of the Jewish community.
It is very likely that the California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will be emulated by other states. Please retain Sample Lessons 40 and 41, "Antisemitism and Jewish Middle EasternAmericans" and "Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race," and please keep bias against Jews and other marginalized communities out.
I look forward to seeing this curriculum used in high schools throughout the US. Thank you in advance.
Sincerely, Bill Moran, PhD
