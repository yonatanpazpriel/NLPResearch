Dear Dept. Of Education Although your new curriculum is an attempt at inclusion, in reality it is exclusionary. I am referring especially to your treatment of the Jewish population via some of the "experts" you have cited. Indeed if your goal is inclusion, it is necessary to investigate what the people who you reference have written. As educators you have a responsibility to be certain that the people you cite have views that are consistent with your goals. Before you publish, carefully evaluate what those that you cite have said or written. Unfortunately, without this careful cross referrencing you put the children of California at risk of repeating what deagoges have said in the past, especially about the Jews. I am concerned about your omissions for my grandchildren's sake, and as an educational professional. Be careful about what you say and approve. Yours truly, Stuart Strongin, Psy.D.
