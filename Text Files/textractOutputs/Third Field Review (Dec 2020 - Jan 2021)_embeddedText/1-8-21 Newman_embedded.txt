From: Stacey Newman Sent: Friday, January 8, 2021 11:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please keep hate out of the classroom
Hello,
I am writing today to urge you to revise the Ethnic Studies Proposed Curriculum to remove content that glorifies current and historical figures who have promoted antisemiticism. You have no idea how much hatred of Jews is out there if you've never experienced it yourself. Given the current political environment, hatred is only growing. Do NOT make it worse.
Please reject Political agendas of others who look to hurt the reputation of Jewish individuals. All groups must be treated fairly and equally.
Thanks for even reading this, Stacey Newman Los Altos Hills, California 94022
