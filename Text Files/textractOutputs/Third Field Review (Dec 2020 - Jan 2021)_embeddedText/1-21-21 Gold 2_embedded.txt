From: D Gold Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Organized Right-wing public comments on Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To: Members of the State Board of Education
I just want you to be aware that there are organized right wing campaigns to generate emails about the Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum.
Some of the organizations have put extensive resources into organizing front groups with different names, representing slightly different ethnic groups and constituencies, trying to get free media through letters to the editor, or personal opinion pieces like the one signed onto by the professors of animal science, veterinary medicine and physics, or twitter attacks. Some websites are soliciting emails to: ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov
For example
Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies (calethstudies.org) https://www.calethstudies.org/
And multiple different front groups at this website including:
https://www.calethstudies.org/aces-educators-for-excellence-in-ethnic-studies
There are also organized campaigns inside other communities generating emails to you like this:

Jews Have Until Thursday to Influence Ethnic Studies Curriculum By Pamela Paresky and Joel Finkelstein January 19, 2021
Please do not be swayed by these organized attacks on Ethnic Studies. Ethnic Studies improves student performance. California High School Students deserve an honest analysis of how race has made a difference in the experience of their communities and families. Thank you for your consideration!
