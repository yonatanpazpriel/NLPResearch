From: Nancy Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:14 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Education
People are consistently leaving California on a daily basis. When might you leave the Jewish people alone to be proud of their history and heritage. Again with this type of negative teachings and failures, California continues to be at the bottom of educational ratings across the country. Of course private or home schooling will become the desired and successful direction of parents if you install this anti Semitic posture in the LA school system. We can silence you by choosing other educational avenues for our children. As so many Jewish people live in LA we will follow this decision closely. As parents-decide to leave LA public education who will be left to promote your hate and lack of truth. Nancy, a proud Jewish person
