From: Adam Rubin Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:58 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Malibu High School graduate Adam Rubin
To whom it may concern,
I am a malibu high graduate from 2007, my id number was [redacted] and my birthday is 6/9/1989. I believe what is being proposed as ethnic studies is antisemitic propaganda. The only time the word privilege is used to describe an ethnicity, it is referring to Ashkenazi Jews. This was what the Nazis did before slaughtering my family. Please revise it again and portray Jews in a more accurate and balanced light.
Thank you. -Adam Rubin
