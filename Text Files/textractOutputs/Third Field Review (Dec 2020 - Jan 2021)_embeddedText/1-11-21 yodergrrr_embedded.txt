Everything about this forced ethnic studies requirement screams division. Division by race. Division by ethnicity. Division by sex. As a 27 year teacher, I have always treated my students as individuals and not some group member. I would never urge my students to be social justice warriors. Any time you put a word in front of justice, it is no longer justice. It is very obvious that these courses will blame every problem of America or probably around the world on whites, somehow. I will not teach my students lies. I will continue to teach them how much freedom and opportunity they have in this wonderful country of ours.
