Dear IQC Chair and Members,
This is a follow-on message from a previous one by Chinese American Citizens Alliance.
Here we have attached two more winning artworks illustrating the contributions of Chinese Americans to the development of the Nation, that can be useful as teaching materials for ethnic studies lessons in K-12, particularly the lower grades.
Wishing you the best in your curriculum review,
Tak Charles Mau National Vice-President Education Chinese American Citizens Alliance https://www.cacanational.org
