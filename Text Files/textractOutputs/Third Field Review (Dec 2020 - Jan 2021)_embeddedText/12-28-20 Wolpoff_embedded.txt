Dear SBE,
I am writing to thank you for listing antisemitism as a form of bigotry and oppression in the ESMC, especially at a time of increasing hate crimes and incidents targeting Jews. The Jewish community must define the hatred targeting our community. I urge SBE to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism.
I appreciate the two lesson plans on Jewish Americans, sample lessons 40 and 41.
Please--I ask for transparency and an opportunity for public comment in all phases of the development of a final ESMC to ensure there is no anti-Jewish or anti-Israel bias. A pedagogically sound Ethnic Studies course will promote respect among students by teaching about the diverse histories, cultures, and contributions to our nation.
Thank you.
Sincerely, Harriet Wolpoff
