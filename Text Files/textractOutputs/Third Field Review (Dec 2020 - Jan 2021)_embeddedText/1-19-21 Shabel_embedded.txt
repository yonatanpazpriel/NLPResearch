From: [email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 11:55 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
As a parent, grandparent, and citizen, I encourage you to make sure the ethnic studies curriculum is balanced with respect to our concerns of AntiZionist bias and language. We don't need more hate speech and acts of violence and prejudice on campuses. We need understanding and balanced presentation without bias or preconceived conclusions of whatever history that is presented. Language designating groups of peoples as oppressors and oppressed is troubling. We do want to prepare our students to be good global citizens. I hope you're careful with the language and material being used.
Thanks for your consideration!
