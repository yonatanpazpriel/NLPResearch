From: Judea Pearl Sent: Wednesday, January 13, 2021 3:47 AM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: matt malkan; Judea Pearl Subject: [EXTERNAL] I oppose the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Ethnic Studies Committee, I strongly oppose the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. I am particularly alarmed by the attempt to associate "whiteness" with "oppression" and "colonialism". I am a "white" Jewish American, and I believe my history is a model of auto-emancipation from oppression and colonialism, culminating in the State of Israel which is an inspirational model of an oppressed ethnic minority lifting itself from the margin of history to become a world center of art, science and entrepreneurship. I want my grandchildren to take pride in this historical transformation and to share it with other minorities, as equal partners of a colorful mosaic of ethnic diversity, not as guilt-ridden "Whites", heirs to undeserved privileges. Sincerely, Judea Pearl Professor UCLA President, The Daniel Pearl Foundation
