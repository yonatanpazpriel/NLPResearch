From: Kamrava, Brandon Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:33 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To whom it may concern,
The characterization of jews in your proposed framework must be addressed and changed. There is clearly a preference to treat certain ethnic groups differently from others.
My family fled Iran under personal threats of death because of their jewish heritage. This included abandoning all belongings. But under the ridiculous curriculum, this entire experience by my parents can be disregarded because at least they could hide behind a vail of whiteness.
Sincerely, Brandon Kamrava, M.D.
