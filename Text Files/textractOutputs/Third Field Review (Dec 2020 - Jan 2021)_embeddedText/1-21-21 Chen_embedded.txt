Are you crazy to push this kind of communist ideas to brainwash our children? These ideas only incite hatred and violence in kids. I want California to provide education to our children that teaches traditional values like loving and caring for others, taking personal responsibilities, and being a productive citizen in the society.
Stop the communist agenda!
