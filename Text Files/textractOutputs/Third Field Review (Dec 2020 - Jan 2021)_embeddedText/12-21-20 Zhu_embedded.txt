From: S. Z Sent: Sunday, December 20, 2020 7:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] No Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for high school students
Hi,
I am a parent of a high school student and a junior high school student. I heard there will be a Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for high school students and I want to express my concern here. What I learned that the ESMC imposes on students a one-sided extreme political ideology a divisive us-versusthem framework. It exacerbates polarization, inculcates an anti-capitalist agenda, and opens the door to antisemitism and other hatred.
This is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our high school.
Best Regards
