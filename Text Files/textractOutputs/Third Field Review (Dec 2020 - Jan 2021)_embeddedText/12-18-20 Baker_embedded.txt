Dear Members of the Instructional Quality Commission, I am supportive of Ethnic Studies courses for high schools. However, I have deep concern about the current Aug. 2020 draft of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). I'd like to add my support for the following two requests for revisions:
 Request Genuine Ethnic Studies Curriculum that Comply with California History-Social Studies Framework 2016, sent to you by Better Ethnic Studies: [link to Drive redacted]
 the detailed revision requests recently sent to you by the Alliance for Constructive Ethnic Studies: [link to Drive redacted]
Thank you for your attention to these crucial problems in the ESMC.
Sincerely, John Menlo Park, CA
