Dear officers,
I heard about this ESMC. I don't think that the ESMC is going to encourage students to accept each other's differences. If kids are taught at their very early age that they are privileged or not privileged just because of their color and ethics, something they can't change, how can they appreciate and accept each other? It will instead plant the hate seeds in this generation and divide America even further among races. This is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our high school. This curriculum feels like it is more about imposing predigested political views on students than about widening their perspectives.
