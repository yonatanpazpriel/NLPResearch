We should be developing curriculum that brings people together by focusing on what we have in common. Our curriculum should celebrate our American Heritage, not demean it. We have created the most amazing and equitable country in the history of our planet. Sure, we have made mistakes, but we should not keep dredging up hurtful memories and opening old wounds. This is not how to heal our society. Certainly you must have noticed that as this type of curricula has begun to be taught, racial tensions have INCREASED, not decreased.
While there remain many, many problems with the curriculum, in particular I object to the use of "African American Studies: Sample Lesson 7: US Housing Inequality: Redlining and Racial Housing Covenants" as it is written. I believe that if this curriculum is taught, that it is extremely important to focus firmly on the fact that housing discrimination is not legal anywhere in the United States and has not been for a very long time.
It is far more helpful to offer lessons that focus on the great number of successes and opportunities that are available to people of all races in this country today and in the future. The American economic system, through capitalism, has provided opportunities for people of all races to rise up in society. There are more black millionaires in the USA than on all of the African continent. We should be teaching our youth how to be more entrepreneurial to take advantage of opportunities available to them.
While, I'm at it, the Common Core Math curriculum is also a step backward, as are the Next Gen Science Standards. The old standards had some issues, but we have taken a big step backwards. We need to get over the idea that all kids need to go to college. There are many good opportunities for success without a college degree.
