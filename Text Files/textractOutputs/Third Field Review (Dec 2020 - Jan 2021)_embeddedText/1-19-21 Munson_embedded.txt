From: Patrick Munson Sent: Sunday, January 17, 2021 11:54 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] New Ethnic Studies Curriculum Proposals
As a retired high school, middle school and elementary school teacher (1970-2013) I am strongly against the proposed Critical Race Theory ideas. Instead of this more emphasis on standard values and reading, writing and math is needed. We are in a serious competition with CCP China for which worldly view will prevail for the future generations. These proposals only weaken and distract our society from it real challenges.
