Please revise your curriculum with regard to Jews. I point out that Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for who the term "privilege" is used. This is outrageous and must be changed. In the midst of the largest recorded surge in anti-Semitic propaganda and attacks against Jewish people across the globe, a new framework for racial theory again counts Jews as members of the evil class. Jews, who represent roughly 0.2% of the world's population and roughly 2% of the U.S. population, are again targeted for their "privilege." Yet, when concerns are raised about the ways in which critical ethnic studies programs promote this type of hatred, the authors of Rethinking Ethnic Studies write, "such strong feelings are part of students' sense-making and development." Critical race theory is not the historical equivalent of Nazism, but it doesn't have to be: the question is whether an American education will help students widen their sense of "us," or once again, teach students to harden their sense of "them." Do not let this happen. Thank you for your attention, Elliot Lepler
