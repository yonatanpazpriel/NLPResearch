Hello,
A simple review of your draft lesson plan highlights a divisive curriculum for ethnic studies. The entire ethnic studies program should be rejected and discarded. This curriculum encourages division and victimization instead of recognizing that this country has made significant progress and changes. Any curriculum that highlights Marxist BLM movements is not welcome. We have strayed so far from Dr. Martin Luther King's message!
