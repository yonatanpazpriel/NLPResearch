From: Calvin Handy Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Module 1460
Dear Sir or Madame,
I am writing in support of the approval and continuation of AB1460, Ethnic Studies in Higher Education.
It has just come to my attention that a group aligned against this much needed legislation has filed a challenge to AB1460 that could have the impact of eliminating or diluting AB1460 such that it's purpose would be practically negligible. This has the feel and impact of a sneak attack, even if it is legal.
In addition to registering my support for AB1460, I also want to express my grave concern that the State of California supports a worthwhile bill like this one which accurately and legitimately offers to educate students in California.
Sincerely,
Calvin Handy [phone redacted] Davis, California
