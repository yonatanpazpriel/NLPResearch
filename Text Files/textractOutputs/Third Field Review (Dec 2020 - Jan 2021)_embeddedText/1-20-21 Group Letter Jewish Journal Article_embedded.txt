From: Aumrivera Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 4:13 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. Why is it that this curriculum has shown antisemitism in it's drafts, over & over again?!
To the Ethnic Studies,
It is very disappointing to have to continuously write to stop antisemitism from being implemented in our children's' Ethnic curriculum studies.
Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. White privilege is racist and it needs to stop. We need to celebrate our differences and educators to teach without prejudice, promote tolerance, not hostility!

The current draft of the mandatory Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum in California celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting "Jews of color" against Jews who are tarred with "conditional whiteness" and its attendant "racial privilege."
