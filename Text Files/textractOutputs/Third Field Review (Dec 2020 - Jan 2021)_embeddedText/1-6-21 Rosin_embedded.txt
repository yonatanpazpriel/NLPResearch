From: Stephanie Rosin Sent: Wednesday, January 6, 2021 12:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Objection to critical race theory in California school curriculum
As a parent and life-long resident of California, I vehemently object to the proposed mandated curriculum requiring schools teach our students critical race theory. Proposition 16 was rejected by voters and I resent this attempt to end run the will of the voters by poisoning our childrens' minds with anti-American propaganda like critical race theory. I guarantee a mass exodus of students from the public school system if this dangerous policy is implemented.
