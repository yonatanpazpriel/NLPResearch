From: Russell Person Sent: Saturday, January 9, 2021 1:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies
Dear Sirs and/or Madams, My family is multi-ethnic. My wife is Russian and her father was Georgian (the true Caucasians) and I have enjoyed traveling the world and rubbing elbows with the natives. Like most Americans, we borrow what we like from any culture that suits our individual tastes. In theory, I have no objection to ethnic studies that do not set one group against another or that paints the predominant American culture or Anglos as oppressive. Such a depiction will do nothing for anyone, but make people angry and cause those from the dominant culture to dig their heels in and become closed to others.
With this in mind, I respectfully ask for a major change to the current draft document that falls way short of a non-biased historical record. I believe that both the bad and good deserve to be discussed, but I object to a cultural war played out upon my child. Please reconsider this ethnic studies approach.
Russell Person, Bakersfield, California
