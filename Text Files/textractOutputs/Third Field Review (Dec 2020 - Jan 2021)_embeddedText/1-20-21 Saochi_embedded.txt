From: Andre Saochi Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum is racist
pitting people against each other, trying to rank races, this curriculum is approaching Nazi propaganda from the other side of the spectrum but an extreme nonetheless.
What a shame that the state which prides itself in being progressive will instead create a new generation of hatred and division rather than a color blind one that can point to a painful past, a struggling present and a future full of hope.
If this curriculum becomes part of public schooling I will move out of this state just on principle to avoid paying taxes that support racist indoctrination of innocent children
