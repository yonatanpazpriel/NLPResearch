Dear State Board of Education:
I am writing to you as a parent, a Jew, a member of the board of the ADL�Central Pacific Region, a member of the Jewish Community Relations Council Assembly, and a Californian.
For the past 18 months, I have been following the saga of the Ethnic Studies Curriculum. It has certainly been an eventful journey.
As someone who has collaborated on draft legislation, I am fully cognizant of how difficult it can be to accommodate every request you receive and capture every viewpoint that is expressed. This is especially true when the issues are as supercharged as those addressed in the Curriculum.
Given these challenges, I am very grateful that the SBE has deleted from an earlier draft of the curriculum anti-Semitic and anti-Israel statements. Likewise, I thank you for adding two lessons regarding Jewish-Americans and addressing the painful topic of anti-Semitism. If one had any illusion that anti-Semitism was a historic relic, a cursory review of footage from the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol would erase any such fantasy. Ample evidence of such hatred can be found in our beloved State.
I would also like to make two requests to make the Curriculum more complete. First, please incorporate into your materials a new ADL online course: BINAH � Building Insights to Navigate Antisemitism and Hate. Second, please employ the definition of anti-Semitism adopted by the E.U. and the U.S. State Department during President's Obama's administration. See Antisemitism Uncovered: A Guide to Old Myths in a New Era: antisemitism. This more nuanced and comprehensive definition was developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance and best captures the full scope of this virulent ideology.
As we turn the page on a presidential administration that fostered hatred and intolerance, and as a new more inclusive administration emerges, I trust that you will bring the same inclusive and generous spirit to the daunting task of reflecting all Californians in your materials. To share one group's story fairly and fully does not diminish any other group's story. There is room under the tent for all of us.
We also know that the same stratagem that is used as a weapon against Jews today will be used against other racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities, or members of the LGBTQIA community tomorrow.

Thank you for considering my comments, and thank you your dedication and your diligence.
Best wishes, Pam Kaufmann
