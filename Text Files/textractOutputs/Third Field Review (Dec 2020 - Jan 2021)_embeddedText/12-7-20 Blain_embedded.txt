Arab Americans are a significant portion of the US population. It does not make sense that there is no specific Arab American studies curriculum remaining with the proposed changes. This is especially important given the senseless attacks on and misinformation circulated about Arab Americans, especially in recent years. Whatever your motivation, it appears that an Arab American studies curriculum could be missing because of this, rather than strengthening the program to counter misinformation.
