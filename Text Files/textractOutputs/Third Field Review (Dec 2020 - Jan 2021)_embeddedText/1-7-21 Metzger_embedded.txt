Critical Race Theory is wrong and divisive. I can't believe that you would even consider teaching in schools that all whites are racist. That in itself is racist. Where do you come up with such ideas? Pitting one race against another is wrong. We all bleed the same red blood. Our lives should be celebrated for our commonalities; recognize differences but do not pit one against another. CRT makes one race feel guilty for being a certain color and for taking the blame for another's lack of success based on color. We are supposed to be in this together, working together and treating each other equally. Making white children feel guilty about being white is wrong. Being born white or black or yellow or red or brown is a chance of birth. We are who we are. And not only that, I read where you are teaching children that gender is a choice. That's insane. Whichever genitals one happens to have tells us whether one is male or female. Period. You can't have a penis and call yourself a female. Penises go into one bathroom and vaginas go into another. Period. It is wrong and goes against all nature to say that gender is a choice. I also disagree with eliminating gender pronouns. He, she, him, her go hand in hand with the penis and vagina reality. I for one will refuse to call a woman or a man a they. No way.
If you insist on teaching this Critical Race Theory, I will pull my granddaughters out of public school very quickly and make sure they attend a private school which doesn't teach such insanity. To include these absurdities into school curricula is wrong and against the positive teachings of parents and churches.
