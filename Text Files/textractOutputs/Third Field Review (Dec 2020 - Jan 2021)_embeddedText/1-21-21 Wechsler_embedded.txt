From: Nancy Wechsler Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 10:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am writing on January 20th 2021, the day that our country elected President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. This is a day of pride as all of us see our country rising up toward healing and away from the ugliness of xenophobia. We are a diverse nation and only through our respect for one another's uniqueness can we succeed.
I am writing as a Californian congregational Rabbi, as a parent of four and an individual whose grandparents immigrated to this country to escape the threat of European anti-Semitism.
I am horrified by this ethnic studies curriculum proposed to teach about the history and diversity within California. The agenda of the authors about Jewish people is blatantly anti-Semitic. The portion dealing with Jewish people is laden with anti-Semitic rhetoric. According to the authors, Jews are the only group in California's for whom the term "privilege" is used.
At this time, in the midst of the largest recorded surge in anti-Semitic propaganda and attacks against Jewish people, the bias about Jews is dangerous and incorrect.
The curriculum does not discuss the ugly and bloody history of what has happened to the Jewish people. It does not state that Jews make up only 2% of the United States. It makes no mention that Jewish people were burned in the ovens of Europe for not being of the Aryan race.
It does raise the old anti-Semitic speech about Jewish people having
privilege. Jewish people, according to the proposed text are the only ethnic group cast as having privilege. Planting this kind of

hateful rhetoric pushes us toward demonization instead of democracy.
Do not proceed with a text that preaches hate, based on the hateful bias of its authors. We are much better than that.
Sincerely, Rabbi Nancy Wechsler
