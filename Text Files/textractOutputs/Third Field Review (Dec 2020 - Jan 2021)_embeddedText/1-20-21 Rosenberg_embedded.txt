From: Richard Rosenberg Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 1:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Curriculum
> > Dear Chairperson, > > I urge you to deny passage of the proposed mandatory Ethnic Studies Curriculum in California. It celebrates individuals who have promoted anti-Semitism, divides people using racial distinctions, and singles out the Jewish people as having racial privilege. Jews are the ONLY group in the curriculum for whom the word "privilege" is used. > > In a time of surging global anti-Semitism, this biased curriculum will only add to hatred and divisiveness. Stop the political indoctrination by voting against this current curriculum. > > Thank you for your consideration, > > RICHARD A ROSENBERG, SOLANA BEACH, CA. >
