To whom it may concern,
As a lifelong Californian, I can't express how very disconcerting this is. How can anyone justify this policy choice? Have you no knowledge of how the seeds of antisemitism have been sown with ideas like these for millennia?

I beg that you reevaluate your choices regarding what sort of influence you'll have over the young minds of this state.
If Jews are privileged, it's not because society somehow prefers them to other ethnicities (a laughable conclusion, especially considering Jews, per capita, are on the receiving end of more hate crimes every single year than *ANY* other minority in this country). No, if they are privileged, it's because they worked hard and prioritized education, a cultural characteristic shared by Jewish communities all over the world.
Thank you, Sivan Schiller
