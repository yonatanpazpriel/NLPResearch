Dear California Department of Education and State Board of Education:
I am writing to provide comments on California's implementation of an ethnic studies curriculum in schools. Ethnic studies should not teach children to harp on racial identity and victimhood as critical race theory advocates. Children should not be taught to see themselves as either oppressors or oppressed based on skin color. Any ethnic studies curriculum should steer clear of CRT ("Critical ES") and be uplifting, with a focus on appreciating different cultures, not on sowing racial divisions and propagating one-sided Marxist political ideology.
Additionally, it is dangerous to include a broad definition of antisemitism that equates criticism of Israel/Zionism with antisemitism because it violates our First Amendment rights. Americans are free to exercise their First Amendment rights and practice boycott, divestment, and sanctions in accordance with their principles.
Finally, the history of Arab Americans should be taught, as well that of other major ethnic groups in California and the U.S.
Thank you.
