From: [email redacted] Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
Dear Sir or Madam,
I have grave concerns about the manner in which Jewish people are described in the proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum in California. The word "privilege" is inappropriate for a people who have been the subject of mass atrocities through the Holocaust and to present day shootings in Pittsburgh and San Diego, among others. The curriculum will breed anti-Semitism against a group that has already been and is currently the subject of mass hatred. Please rethink your description to avoid creating hatred when you are striving to educate and eradicate it.
Sincerely, Brenda Simon
