From: Adrienne Acosta Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:18 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Do not water down Ethnic Studies
California students deserve Ethnic Studies that does not water down the impact of race on people of color. Please maintain all the lesson plans which concerned Californians have contributed and allow local teachers the choice of including what best meets the needs of their students. Please do not give into the organized right wing attack on what they call Critical Ethnic Studies.
It's hard to stress the importance of teaching Ethnic Studies and the impact of race on people of color during this time. White supremacists have stormed the capitol, right wing groups have been emboldened over the last 4 years. Californians deserve better.
Sincerely, Adrienne Acosta
