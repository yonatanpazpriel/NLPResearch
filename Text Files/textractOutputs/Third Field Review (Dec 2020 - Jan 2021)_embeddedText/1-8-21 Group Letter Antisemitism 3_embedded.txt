Dear IQC Members, Thank you for making significant improvements to the second draft, including removal of all references to the BDS campaign and other overtly biased content targeting Jews and Israel. I want to encourage you to include Bayard Rustin, Albert Memmi, Vicki Shiran, Loolwa Khazzoum in the �oeInternational Experience�, and reject divisive figures that promote antisemitism and other destructive ideologies. I encourage the IQC to define antisemitism in a way that truly reflects the entirety of the Jewish community�TMs experiences, and include the comprehensive definition of antisemitism. Include the ADL�TMs lesson plan, BINAH (Building Insights to Navigate Antisemitism and Hate) in the appendix, along with retaining the ICS and JIMENA�TMs lesson plans about antisemitism and Jewish identity in America. I also would like to see all lesson plans on antisemitism have the links that were submitted included with all copies of the lesson plans, in keeping with the School Board of Education�TMs guidelines that require that the ESMC �oeinclude access to �primary source documents.� Thank you. -- Ms Kate Chavez [email redacted] [address redacted] Sherman Oaks, CA, CA
