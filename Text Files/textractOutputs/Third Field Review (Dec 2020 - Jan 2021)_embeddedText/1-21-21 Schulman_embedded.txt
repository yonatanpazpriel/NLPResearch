We must be careful in ethnic studies how Jewish people are being seen. I spoke of this over one year ago and things have not improved.
There ought to be no discussion about Jews and privilege that doesn't begin by talking about the historically enacted and repeated genocidal ideology that revolves around Jews and privilege. For an ethnic studies curriculum to go traipsing through that discourse without a single mention of its ugly and bloody history is not a lesson about antiSemitism. It is a repetition of it. By itself, that should effectuate a vote of no confidence in the entire franchise.
