From: Laura Holmes Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:22 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews in CA ethnic studies curriculum
To Whom it May Concern: I am writing on behalf of, not only all Jewish people, but of all people. History of the Jewish people must be written in its truest form - not whitewashed with the term "privileged" to ever be associated with how a "whiter" jew is treated. Until the truth, and nothing but the truth is written, nothing should be written down - yet. Get the facts straight about our Jewish family members, friends, neighbors, and to all of their ancestors who deserve the truth be told. Do the right thing. Thank you for reading this email.
Sincerely, Laura Holmes, kindergarten teacher
