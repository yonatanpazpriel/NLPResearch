From: Siyu Liu Sent: Monday, January 18, 2021 9:05 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Siyu G Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public comment on the 3rd and final draft of Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC)
Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education: I am a resident of California for 20 years; my child is attending public school. I am writing to you to voice my deep concern regarding Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) third and final field version. This curriculum is imbalanced and biased. It definitely needs revision before being implemented. The curriculum should aim to allow students to gain knowledge of experiences and historical contributions of our diverse ethnic and racial groups. It should promote tolerance, recognition and appreciation of the contributions of ALL ethnic groups and encourage students to be proud of their own heritages. There are 3 aspects that need revision: 1. Recognition of Chinese Immigrants' contribution to STEM arena When reviewing the curriculum, I found that the Chinese immigrants' contribution to the world and America hasn't been well recognized as it has been as other ethnic groups: For example, except for Chinese immigrants help building transcontinental railroad, no Chinese Americans were recognized in the curriculum for their contribution in fields, such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
There are quite a few famous Chinese American scientist, to name a few:
1. Dr. Steven Chu Dr. Chu received the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on cooling atoms in 1997.
2. Chien-Shiung Wu Wu was known to many scientists as the "First Lady of Physics" and played a pivotal role in experimentally demonstrating the violation of the law of conservation of parity in the field of particle physics.
3. Roger Y. Tsien "Mr. Tsien was an American biochemist. He was a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego[7] and was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein, in collaboration with organic chemist Osamu Shimomura and neurobiologist Martin Chalfie.[8][9][10] Tsien was also a pioneer of calcium imaging.[9][11]"
4. Shing-Tung Yau
Shing-Tung Yau is an American mathematician and the William Caspar Graustein Professor of Mathematics at Harvard University.[1]
"Yau was born in Shantou, China, moved to Hong Kong at a young age, and to the United States in 1969. He was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982, in recognition of his contributions

to partial differential equations, the Calabi conjecture, the positive energy theorem, and the Monge�Amp�re equation.[2] Yau is considered as one of the major contributors to the development of modern differential geometry and geometric analysis. The impact of Yau's work can be seen in the mathematical and physical fields of differential geometry, partial differential equations, convex geometry, algebraic geometry, enumerative geometry, mirror symmetry, general relativity, and string theory, while his work has also touched upon applied mathematics, engineering, and numerical analysis.""

2. Remove revolutionary role models from Sample Lesson 6: Important Historical Figures Among People of Color The goal of the ethnic study is to recognize contribution of ALL of the ethnic groups, so students can appreciate people from ALL ethnic groups and treat them equally without bias. By studying history of the social injustice in the past, we want the students to be aware that people should not be judged based on their skin color and races. Students need to develop their critical thinking skills to determine how they can help the whole society to make sure every ethnic groups are treated equally via peaceful means. I am shocked to see that the list of African-American inspirational leaders in the sample curriculum does not include Martin Luther King or John Lewis. Instead, the curriculum listed revolutionary socialists such as Angela Davis, Assata Shakur and Mumia AbuJamal (Appendix A pages 44-46). Both Abu-Jamal and Shakur were convicted of firstdegree murder of a police officer. This is really alarming. Violent doesn't contribute to public good and should not be promoted in the curriculum, it against the guiding principle of the curriculum- "contribute to the public good and help strengthen democracy"
Per preface of the curriculum," When schools help students acquire a "social
consciousness", they are better equipped to contribute to the public good and help
strengthen democratic institutions.
The role of our public schools to promote understanding and appreciation of its diverse population must be an essential part of the curriculum offered to every student."
Therefore, please remove "Angela Davis and Mumia Abu-Jamal" from the important historical figures.
Also, please add Hiram Fong, Dr, Feng Shan Ho and Steven Chu to the list of Asian American important historical figures.
1. Hiram Fong:

According to NBCNews1, "Mr. Fong, born to Chinese immigrants in Hawaii, Fong was one of Hawaii's first senators, the first Asian American senator" 2. Dr. Feng Shan Ho3: Dr. Ho is an unknown World World II hero, single-handed saved thousands of Australian Jews during Holocaust 3. Steven Chu: (mentioned in item#2)
4. Chien-Shiung Wu: (mentioned in item#2) 5. Roger Y. Tsien: (mentioned in item#2) 6. Shing-Tung Yau: (mentioned in item#2)

3. Include Museums for Chinese heritage in the recommended list of Museums While museums for other heritages have been recommended for heritage study for Black, Hispanic, Indian ethnic groups etc, there is no museum specifically for Chinese Heritage being recommended In fact, there are quite a few of museums available for heritage study. To name a few: 1. Chinese Historical Society of America Museum, website: https://chsa.org/ 2. Chinese cultural center of San Francisco, website: https://www.cccsf.us Thank you for your consideration,
Respectfully yours, Siyu Henningsen
