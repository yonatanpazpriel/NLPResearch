Dear California Department of Education State Board of Education,
For nearly thirty years, the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) has advocated for an educational curriculum which more adequately represents the contributions and viewpoints of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and has developed coalitions with other educational, ethnic, and community organizations to promote equitable and quality education for all children.
Championing Ethnic Studies is the highest priority for APISBMA. In the past year, APISBMA has led a statewide campaign to add greater diversity and inclusivity into the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, uniting teachers and curriculum developers from all backgrounds to add, edit, and refine various sections and lesson plans.
The desired revisions which are focused on usability, accessibility, and equity are as follows:
1. The "Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth" Lesson, Sample Lesson #31 in Appendix A, should be listed as the first sample lesson in the AAPI unit and be rewritten to remove stereotypes and to incorporate reflection based on analyzing data.
2. Language should be added to Chapter 3: Instructional Guidance for K-12 Education to frame "Asian Americans and the Model Minority Myth" as a foundational lesson to the AAPI Unit and as an indispensable component of any Ethnic Studies course.
3. In the AAPI Unit, the pan-Asian lesson plans should be listed first, followed by one lesson plan per ethnic group in alphabetical order, and concluding with an additional resources section for groups with more than one lesson plan. Groups with more than one lesson plan should provide input on which lesson plan is foundational for their group. Attached is a recommended order.
4. Appendix A should be reclassified as "Chapter 4" in the ESMC and "Chapter 4: Bibliography" should be reclassified as "Chapter 5: Bibliography" Appendices A and B (formerly Appendices B and C). The lesson plans must be highlighted as core content for educators to build Ethnic Studies courses, not as supporting content in an Appendix.

5. We recommend the inclusion of various museums and institutions into Appendix B: Lesson Resources. California offers some of the most critical museums and historical sites in the United States to showcase various underrepresented narratives in teaching Ethnic Studies.
APISBMA submits these recommendations, and various line edits across the Model Curriculum, in the following attachments. We are joined by a coalition of community-based organizations and leaders that have offered endorsement letters for APISBMA's position. Together, APISBMA holds that the Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies unit will be more inclusive and equitable to reflect the diversity within the AAPI community.

Dear California Department of Education State Board of Education,
As a separate addendum, the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) recommends the following changes to the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum:
1. To avoid confusion with Sample Lesson 31: "Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and the Model Minority Myth", Sample Lesson 30 "Indian American Diaspora, Myths of the Model Minority" should be retitled as "Indian Americans: Creating Community and Establishing an Identity in California."
2. In Appendix A, Sample Lessons 33, 34 and 35, should be considered one lesson but separated within the lesson as Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3. This combined lesson plan can have the chapter title, "South Asian Americans in the United States."
3. While we agree that the terms "Indian" and "South Asian" should not be used interchangeably in lessons 31, 33, 34, and 35, we maintain that the category "Indian" and "South Asian" be retained in their respective lesson plans. The category "South Asian" should only be employed for lesson plans adequately represented by multiple groups outside the context of India. Consequently, recommendations to replace the term "Indian" with "South Asian" in these lesson plans inaccurately and inadequately depict the experiences of many other communities from South Asia.
We urge the State Board of Education to accept these lesson plans and approve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. Ethnic Studies affords all of us the opportunity to embrace and empower the global citizen in California's youth.

On behalf of the Board of Directors of the San Mateo County API (Asian Pacific Islander), I am pleased to share that the Caucus supports the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) request for revisions to the final draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the State Board of Education (SBE) in March 2021.
The desired revisions which are focused on usability, accessibility, and equity are as follows:

Groups with more than one lesson plan should provide input on which lesson plan is foundational for their group.
4. Appendix A should be reclassified as "Chapter 4" in the ESMC and "Chapter 4: Bibliography" should be reclassified as "Chapter 5: Bibliography" Appendices A and B (formerly Appendices B and C). The lesson plans must be highlighted as core content for educators to build Ethnic Studies courses, not as supporting content in an Appendix.
The San Mateo API Caucus was formed in 2019 to give voice to the largest and fastest growing cultural demographic in San Mateo County. Comprised of API city council elected officials from cities throughout San Mateo County, we are raising the visibility of the Asian community � We count!

The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants (CERI) is a nonprofit organization based in Oakland, California with a mission to improve the social, emotional, psychological, economic, and physical health of refugees and immigrants from Southeast Asia affected by war, torture, genocide or other forms of extreme trauma. Founded in 2005 by a group of bilingual/bicultural mental health professionals, CERI provides culturally-relevant mental health and other social services. We are dedicated to transforming the lives of refugees and immigrants and their families, many of whom suffer from weakening intergenerational relationships, layers of complex needs, and exposure to violence and trauma both in their current environments and in their native countries.
The Center for Empowering Refugees and Immigrants supports the Asian Pacific Islander School Board Members Association (APISBMA) request for revisions to the final draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) to be presented to the State Board of Education (SBE) in March 2021.

As service providers and advocates for Southeast Asian Americans, we are excited that there will be a more equitable Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies Unit in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. We are hopeful that future generations of learners will have access to a curriculum that accurately illustrates the experiences of our communities. And we also support APISBMA's recommendations to further increase equity, usability and accessibility.

16 Lesson Overview:
17 This 3 day lesson introduces students to the complexity of the term `Asian American,' 18 ultimately coming to understand the various ethnic groups and politics associated with 19 the identity marker. Additionally, students will also be exposed to the concept of the 20 model minority myth. This course will provide for students the implications that result 21 when lumping all Asian groups together and labeling them the Model Minority. For 22 example, marginalized groups (i.e. Pacific Islanders, Southeast Asians) suffer from 23 being cut out of programs and resources. It presents a false narrative that Asian 24 Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) have overcome racism and prejudice. It glosses 25 over the violence, harm and legalized racism that AAPIs have endured, i.e. the Chinese

26 massacre in Los Angeles 1871, the annexation of Hawaii, shooting of Southeast Asian 27 school children in Stockton. Furthermore, students will understand how this label for 28 AAPIs becomes a hindrance to expanding democratic structures and support, and worst 29 how it creates a division among the AAPI community and places a wedge between 30 them and other oppressed groups including but not limited to African American, Latinx, 31 and American Indian communities.

32 Key Ethnic Studies Terms and Concepts: 33 Assimilation, stereotype, identity, model minority myth, racism, anti-blackness, data 34 disaggregation

35 Lesson Objectives: Students will be able to

36

1. Analyze the misconceptions of the model minority to describe Asian Americans

37

and Pacific Islanders.

38

2. Differentiate the various identities, nationalities, and ethnicities that make up the

39

Asian American and Pacific Islander community.

40

3. Learn to analyze statistical data and legislation that directly impacts communities

41

of color.

42

4. Actively dispel stereotypes and the model minority myth

43 Essential Questions:

44

 What does Asian American mean? And who is Asian American and Pacific

45

Islander?

46

 How has the model minority myth been used to oppress and/or stymie certain

47

Asian American and Pacific Islander communities?

48

 What are the dangers of the model minority myth?

49

 What are ways you can dispel the model minority myth?

50 Lesson Steps/Activities:

51 Day 1
52 1. Place four large pieces of flip chart paper in each corner of the room along with three

53

to five markers. Engage the class by asking students What does Asian American

54

mean? What does Pacific Islander mean?

55 2. Before delving too deeply into discussion, divide the class up into four groups. Each

56

group is assigned to a corner and instructed to take ten minutes as a group to

57

respond to the aforementioned question. Also ask the groups to list the various

58

ethnic groups that comprise `Asian American and Pacific Islander'.

59 3. After about ten minutes, signal for the groups to stop what they are doing. Allow

60

each group to share what they discussed with the class. After each group has

61

shared, provide a definition for Asian American and Pacific Islander and begin listing

62

some of the various ethnic groups (see below for a sample list).

63

Sample Ethnic Groups (this list is in no way exhaustive - listed in the order of

64

population according to the 2010 Census):

65

Definition of Asian American: The term Asian American was born out of the Asian

86

American Movement (1968-1975) as a means of identifying people of Asian descent

87

living in the United States. During the late 1960s, the term was largely seen as

88

radical and unifying, a rejection of `oriental' and other pejoratives that were

89

associated with people of Asian descent. The collective coining of the term was an

90

act of self-naming and self-determination, and aligned with the broader goals of the

91

Asian American and Pacific Islander movement--equality, justice, and anti-racism.

92 4. After sharing the definition and ethnic groups listed above, reiterate that Asian

93

American and Pacific Islander is a loaded term that encompasses dozens of

94

different Asian ethnic groups that have settled in the U.S., with large populations

95

settling in California.

96 5. Ask students if what impact stereotypes on a group this diverse might have on

97

groups of people who are stereotyped? Then ask students if they know what the

98

model minority myth is. If students are able to answer, move to the article. If not,

99

describe the model minority myth and explain to the students that they will be

100

examining the effects of racial stereotypes that are perceived to be positive can in

101

fact be harmful. For example, the teacher can describe the effects of stereotype

102

threat.

103 6. Ask students to read the article "'Model Minority' Myth Again Used As A Racial

104

Wedge Between Asians And Blacks' in Code Switch (see link in resource list). Note

105

that this article references William Petersen's 1966 New York Times article that

106

inherently pitted Japanese Americans (arguably Asian Americans more broadly)

107

against African Americans, with Petersen identifying the latter group as the "problem

108

minority." Following internment, Japanese Americans were able to achieve some

109

level of social and economic mobility, rendering them the "model minority," for their

110

ability to thrive in the face of adversity unlike their African American counterparts.

111

After reading the NPR piece, explain to students that the Petersen article is first time

112

the term "model minority" was used (or coined) and marks the beginning of the

113

stereotyping of Asian Americans as inherently "smart" and "successful". Ask

114

students to reflect on the main points of the NPR article and discuss how and why

115

the model minority myth is used as a wedge group.

116 7. Tell students that they will gain an understanding of the diversity of AAPI

117

communities by exploring statistics on education and poverty. Split the class into

118

groups of three and instruct half of the groups to review educational data and the

119

other half economic data.

and with the rest of the U.S. (https://aapidata.com/policy/poverty/)

124

125

Each student group will report their findings to the class. Each group will write

126

their findings for their assigned part on the board or a sheet of poster paper. For

127

example, one group can describe how Asian American and Pacific Islander

128

groups vary in terms of reading and math test scores; another group can

129

summarize the educational attainment of various Pacific Islander groups.

130

131 For homework, have students answer the following questions. Students can use the

132 resources at the end of the lesson to help them answer the questions. Tell students that

133 each question requires at least two examples/arguments:

134

- How are Asian American and Pacific Islander ethnic groups similar and different

135

in terms of their education and economic experiences?

136

- How might the "model minority myth" be an obstacle for advancement for Asian

137

Americans?

138

- How can the "model minority myth" be used to drive a wedge between Asian

139

Americans and other communities of color in policies and services.

140

- Knowing that AAPIs are not a monolithic "model minority" and that each ethnic

141

group fares differently economically and educationally, how might policies

142

change to be more inclusive of those groups in need in terms of jobs, services,

143

government funding, employment, small business, education, etc?

144

145

146

Create a chart of arguments and counter arguments

147

148 1. Start the class by asking students to share their counter arguments with the groups

149

that they were in yesterday. After each group mate has shared their counter

150

arguments, ask the groups to share what they believe to be the strongest counter

151

argument with the entire class.

152 3. To better illustrate the problems with `model minority,' play a short video, "Why Data

153

Matters When It Comes to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and Education"

154

(see resources). Following the screening, explain what it means to disaggregate

155

data and its connection to the model minority myth.

156 5.3. During the second half of class hand out copies of the law signed by Governor

157

Brown on September 25, 2016 California Assembly Bill 1726 (Data Collection). Have

158

students take turns reading the bill aloud popcorn style. After the in-class reading,

159

provide necessary context on what a bill is, and summarize how bills become laws.

160

Additionally, define any words or terms students may be struggling with. In groups,

161

have students discuss the purpose of the bill, impact that it will have on AAPI

162

communities, and how the legislation helps dispel the model minority myth.

163 6.4. As homework, ask students to complete a "mini bill analysis" of Assembly Bill

164

1726 using the worksheet below.

165

166 Day 3

167 The key method to dispel the model minority myth is by telling the true stories of

168 yourself, your family and your community. By writing down, speaking aloud and sharing

169 your stories, you actively counteract the stereotypes and master narrative developed to

170 pigeon hold Asian American and Pacific Islanders as a monolithic group with one

171 identity, one experience and one role. No AAPI individual fits the model minority

172 stereotype in all its facets. Take time in your class for students to first Think, Write, and

173 then Share on 3 questions:

174

1. What is your ethnic background?

175

2. What stereotype is there of your ethnic group that you do not identify with?

176

Why? Explain in detail with facts about your experience, your background, your

177

values, your goals, your dreams, your family, your community.

178

3. How will you actively dispel these stereotypes?

179

180 Application, Action, and Reflection: Students will read and analyze an article,

181 demographic data, and a legislative document, providing their own informed critiques,

182 opinions, and feedback on the sources. Students will further analyze how the document

183 supports or argues against the model minority myth. Students will also tell their stories

184 as a way to dispel the harmful stereotypes that the media and society imposes on their

185 ethnic group.

231 How can being an upstanding American citizen be a double-edged sword? During the 232 post-World War II era and after nearly a hundred years of anti-Asian sentiment and 233 legislation, many Asian Americans hoped to be seen as more American and accepted 234 by American society. They didn't want to be viewed as a threat to national security like 235 Japanese Americans were when they were imprisoned during WWII. Instead, they 236 wanted to be seen as "good Americans" and desired to assimilate and Americanize, 237 which developed into the idea of the "model minority myth," recasting Asian Americans 238 as prime examples of representing the quintessential American values of opportunity, 239 meritocracy, and the American Dream. Toy Len Goon, the first ever Asian American 240 named American Mother of the Year in 1952 was an early example of what it meant to 241 be a "model minority."
242 During the 1960s, as the Civil Rights Movement continued the fight for equality of all 243 Americans, and the federal government invested in social welfare programs such as the 244 War on Poverty and Great Society, the concept of the "model minority" became a 245 stereotype used to pit Asian Americans against other communities of color, particularly 246 Black Americans. News publications ran articles extolling the ways Asian Americans 247 capitalized on the American Dream with their work ethic and emphasis on education. By 248 doing this, it delegitimized centuries of systemic oppression and racist policies that 249 shaped the experiences of Black Americans.
250 This stereotype also hid how Asian Americans were discriminated against based on 251 racist policies, such as being excluded from living in certain neighborhoods and from 252 being fully accepted members of American society. It created a limited perspective on 253 the Asian American community, where they were seen as one monolithic group. In 254 reality, this community has consisted of diverse ethnicities from a variety of countries 255 and cultures, comprising over ten different languages. Thus, socio-economic success 256 was not universal, and praising Asian Americans as a "model minority" called into 257 question the fact that there were many within the community who did not get the 258 services and government assistance they needed.
259 The "model minority myth" has persisted well after the stereotype developed. Media 260 publications such as Time's 1987 cover story "Those Asian American Whiz Kids" and 261 articles analyzing the work ethic of Asian Americans in response to Amy Chua's 2011 262 book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother illustrated that the "model minority myth" is still 263 being perpetuated.
