From: Eynat Atia Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:22 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed CA Ethnic Studies Anti-Semitic
Dear Ethnics Studies Committee:
I urge you to reject the proposed curriculum on Israel and the Jewish people as it is currently presented; It appears to be motivated by anti-semitic rhetoric and theories with an agenda to invite and promote hatred of Jews through false information.
Please do not approve hate as a part of our state's education system, even if concealed as something else. This curriculum is extremely dangerous and must be stopped!
Thank you,
Eynat Atia
