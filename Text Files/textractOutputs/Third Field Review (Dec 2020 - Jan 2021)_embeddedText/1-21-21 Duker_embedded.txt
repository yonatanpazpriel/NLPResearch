From: Duker, Jesse Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews and Equity
To Whom it May Concern,
I am very alarmed to hear the proposal to label Jews as "white" or to suggest we benefit from "white privilege". My first cousin was murdered specifically because she was a Jew. She was targeted and killed for being a Jew. What privilege is that?
I am a white skinned Jew. I am not white. I am a Jew, and I have experienced anti-semitism and bigotry. Please do better, get his out of the curriculum.
Respectfully,
Jesse Duker
