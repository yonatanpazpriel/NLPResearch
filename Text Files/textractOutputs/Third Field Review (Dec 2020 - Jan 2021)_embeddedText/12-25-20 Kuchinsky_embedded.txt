From: Jan Kuchinsky Sent: Friday, December 25, 2020 3:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic studies curriculum
I am writing to express my concern about anti-Jewish and anti- Israel content being considered for inclusion in the public education ethnic studies curriculum. This type of biased content will only perpetuate anti-Semitic and politically biased stereotypes and prejudice. I also object to any inclusion of BDS propaganda. Thank you.
Sincerely, Jan Kuchinsky [address redacted] Pleasanton, CA
