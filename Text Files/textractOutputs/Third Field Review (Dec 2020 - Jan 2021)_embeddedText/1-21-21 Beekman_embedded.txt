From: Stanley Beekman Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish Privilege
Dear Sir/Madam,
Your ethnic studies curriculum associates the word "privilege" with Jews. Indeed, of all the ethnic groups that you describe, Jews are the only group that you place the word "privilege" beside.
As a Jew, I can tell you about my privilege.
My grandmother came from a town called Torchin in what is now the Ukraine. She had the privilege of watching her brother being beheaded and her and her sisters being raped in a pogrom by the Cossacks. She came to this country to escape this kind of brutality and to put that behind her. Her relatives that stayed behind had the privilege of being massacred by the Nazis. In her town of 1600 only a few survived. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org_torchin&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaA-Txl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=FrnYKYtrN_FyaynkSfoXLjIJJSdy1YK-Uw3TnQ1Arw&s=gchWgN9HvGh_uPqMOw5X4ZPJgIkwNP_dyf05HTEjh-Y&e=
My other grandmother also had the privilege of being born one year after her 4 siblings survived the pogrom of Odessa where 400 were killed. She had to privilege of escaping and coming to this country to escape the Odessa massacre where tens of thousands of her relatives and other Jews were killed. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_1941-5FOdessa-5Fmassacre&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaA-Txl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=FrnYKYtrN_FyaynkSfoXLjIJJSdy1YK-Uw3TnQ1Arw&s=0m_6SGV8uKU4xyJGHkV7WvDVTtd_-6LEsrGaSalDHDU&e=
My grandfather had the privilege of coming to this country because he was an orphan and as a result escaped the Nazis and Russians killing 30,000 fellow Jews. https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https3A__en.wikipedia.org_wiki_Lutsk-5FGhettoLutsk&d=DwIFaQ&c=SIStQSL0VMIUJoLS-Q8giiFlAAKdP7tpJHyQh8DeXk&r=2OaA-Txl6K6ZRmr4TOdWGvysPQu38AWfS6kE1RPAYl8&m=FrnYKYtrN_FyaynkSfoXLjIJJSdy1YK-Uw3TnQ1Arw&s=sdLUtxd6pMIy6hgzAp4Etcf-PE1W0jJ7ALf7ZrMlR00&e=
My other grandfather had the privilege of growing up poor as his father died at an early age. He had the privilege of watching his two sister die of diphtheria and being so poor that his mother's table had areas carved out to serve as bowls. He had the privilege of losing 70% of his uncles and aunts to the Nazis. The others had the privilege of going to the forced labor camp of Lvov.
I had the privilege of getting beaten up because I was Jewish, getting called names, and being threatened with "I will cut your heart out you stinking Jew"
My children have had the privilege of being excluded from parties of the neighborhood kids, and being called a dumb Jew.
All the kids in my temple's Sunday school class have admitted that they have the privilege of being a victim of an anti-Semitic incident.
I cringe at the thought of anti-Semitism rising again in this country.
The thought that your curriculum can lead to this scares me and my fellow Jews. The term privilege vilifies Jews to

poor people and people of color, even though Jews have fought hard for equal rights. I along with my other Jewish classmates protested for open admissions of City College of New York in 1970. As a result of our protest, the City University of New York allowed open admissions.
I urge you to revise your curriculum to increase tolerance toward Jews and all people rather than decrease it.
Thank you,
Stanley Beekman
