From: Jennifer Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:47 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California ETHNIC Curriculum model
I am greatly against the California Ethnic curriculum model that is currently proposed. This is outrageous and it must be taken away. Jewish people are NOT privileged and each day we have to deal with antisemitism including our local synagogue, Wilshire Blvd that was had horrific hate words graffiti on it just this week.
Please stop this.
