Dear Sir or Madam,
Any ethnic studies curriculum must have at its core teachings about systematic racial discrimination and its root causes. Including the impact of racial discrimination on those historically discriminated groups in California. California history must be understood through this lens or we will not be able to address systematic racism. The ethnic studies as developed by our states colleges are the perfect vehicle for stopping discrimination. This is also very different from multiculturalism which explores appreciation of other cultures, this also has a place but it should be separated from these teachings for they will not directly teach about systematic racism.
Thank you.
