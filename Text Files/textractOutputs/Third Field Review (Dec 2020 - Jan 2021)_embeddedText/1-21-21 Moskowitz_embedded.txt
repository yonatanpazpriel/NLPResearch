Dear Sirs,
Upon learning of your classification of Jewish people as "privileged" and frankly this saddens me that the most diversified state on the west coast is now heading toward misunderstanding. Misunderstanding leads to intolerance, intolerance leads to Anti-Semitism. This is a slippery slope that you are traveling down, and leads to much darker and scary places. My father was an educator for 32 years in Los Angeles and I'm sure he is rolling over in his grave with the use of that word "privileged". What does that actually mean?
I checked the definition of privileged per the merriam webster dictionary is:
privilege: noun
Definition of privilege (Entry 1 of 2) : a right or immunity granted as a peculiar benefit, advantage, or favor : PREROGATIVE especially : such a right or immunity attached specifically to a position or an office
privilege verb privileged; privileging Definition of privilege (Entry 2 of 2) transitive verb
1: to grant a privilege to 2: to accord a higher value or superior position to privilege one mode of discourse over another
How is .02% of the US Population and 2% of California's Population Privileged??
Thank you for your time.
-Yours Truly,
