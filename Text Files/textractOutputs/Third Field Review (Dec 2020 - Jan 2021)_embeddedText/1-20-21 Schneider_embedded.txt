From: Joel Schneider Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 8:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
To those in charge of finalizing the coursework:
Please change the sections relating to Jews that are blatantly antisemitic and have been included for the purpose of disparaging and separating Jews from everyone else. It's obvious that the people who framed this proposal intended to single out Jews and Israel for their vitriol and to denigrate their contributions to the USA and the world.
Frankly, from looking over all the parts from the time it was initially proposed, it's apparent that the contributors to this began with an anti-Jewish, anti-Israel agenda that they implemented thought out the syllabus even where that was of little relevance to the topic at hand.
It's despicable that something like this has reached the stage where it may be approved to be presented as the basis for teaching our children today.
If this proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is approved as written, I'm confident that there will be many people and organizations, not only Jews, who will be challenging it in all venues across the board not only for its blatant Jew-hatred, but for the omission and marginalization of other ethnic groups who have contributed to our great state.
Sincerely,
Joel Schneider
