From: Ellie Nadler Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 5:10 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft
To: California State Board of Education From: Eleanor Nadler, [address redacted], Santa Rosa, CA
Thank you for this opportunity to express my gratitude for the years of great progress made in our State curriculum and textbooks regarding ethnic studies and the many aspects of inclusivity. I began volunteer work in this field at the state level in the 1970's, representing the Jewish community of San Diego.
Great strides have been made since then, and I'm particularly appreciative of your two lesson plans on Jewish Americans, and the references to antisemitism.
I would like to call attention to, and suggest incorporation of The Anti-Defamation League's BINAH program Building Insights to Navigate Antisemitism and Hate. It teaches that no form of hate is tolerable.
Furthermore, I urge the SBE to use the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's complete definition of antisemitism, as adopted by our U.S. State Department as well as the European Union.
Also, I want to thank the SBE for eliminating an earlier draft which included anti- Israel and antisemitic bias.
Events of the past couple of weeks have shined an additional spotlight on the importance of the work you are doing. We must continue to use every possible tool and pathway to fight hate in our great nation. The work you are doing will promote respect among our students for the value of our diversity and the important contributions made by all Americans.
Thank you, Eleanor Nadler
