From: Sondra Goldstein Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Suggestion for Ethnic Studies Curriculum
This is the third ethnic studies curriculum iteration that I have seen and the third time that I have written my objection to the description of Jews. Instead of improvements in the depiction of Jews, there is continued disparagement of Jews and curriculum content that promotes antiSemitism. Are there any members of the committee who are Jewish? I think that the answer must be No, or this negative view of Jews would not be repeatedly written into the curriculum. Surely there can be a better version not filled with anti-Semitism. Please rewrite the sections on Jews and mention something positive and fair. Jews (who have been persecuted throughout history) do not deserve this curriculum which promotes hatred and disparagement. Jews are the ONLY ethnic group depicted as privileged and "evil" including the ideas that Jews "hide" their identity by name changes. This is the 21st century and such ancient tropes about Jewish are absurd. Yes, in Nazi Germany this was the case, but not today. Hopefully, your curriculum can be changed to reflect Jews more accurately.
