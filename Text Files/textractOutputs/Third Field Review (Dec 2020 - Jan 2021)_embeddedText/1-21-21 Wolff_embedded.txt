From: Jeff Wolff Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] new curriculum on Jewish peoples
I strongly object to this proposed curriculum. it only serves to differentiate and distract and further divide this country for non-white and white privileged. This country needs to come together, to respect the heritage and background of all peoples backgrounds, but now we are all Americans and should be equal. Unity has to begin with the education of our youth, and this type of use of racial distinction does nothing but divide people that are white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed).
This is a terrible curriculum which will create discrimination, racism and hatered and we have had enough of that!
