From: Danny Shader Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 9:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-Semitism within CA Ethnic Studies curriculum
Hi there
Please reconsider the proposed curriculum for California's Ethnic Studies course. In its latest form, it perpetuates anti-Semitic stereotypes and is deeply offensive. We are living in time in which anti-Semitism is on the rise, both within our country and around the world; what students are taught should further understanding, not deepen divisions.
Also, it's super-depressing that we have to continue playing whack-a-mole on this issue. Is there any way to keep us from continually having to request that you not include anti-Semitic material in the curriculum?
Thank you Daniel Shader Palo Alto, CA
