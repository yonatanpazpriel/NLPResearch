I am deeply offended at the continued refusal to treat antisemitism with equal emphasis and importance in the proposed curriculum. There is absolutely no reason for this. For example, Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. The unequal treatment of Jews in the proposed curriculum is nothing short of blatant discrimination and hatred.
Today, I read the following article. If you needed any proof that antisemitism is alive and well right here in our back yard, here it is (and there are many many more who feel this way. You could see by reading their blogs and Facebook groups.)

Farhad Khorasani is an Iranian-American international lawyer. He thinks Hitler was right and wants another one.
Here's more content you could include in your emails should you wish to do so:
Please read the article below to further educate yourselves on why the current curriculum is so utterly discriminatory, hateful and offensive to Jews and should undergo a massive rewrite.
I once asked my graduate school professor a question about an assignment to make sure I was doing it correctly and I was responded with "it's your jewish guilt asking". This was deeply offensive to me not to mention that I stand for all minorities, including LGBT which he was a part of, and I still stand for LGBT bc I care for all. Not being treated the same hurts. On my first week of working, I work in a medical field, I had check the abdomen of a young male patient tattooed with swasticas. I did all I could to make sure he received the best care while thinking how he would've treated me

if I was under his mercy. It was a very emotional encounter for me that I will not forget. I fled a country, Iran, to be free from hatred and antisemitism just a to see these situations here.
We've worked HARD to get to where we are. We've encountered our fair share of antisemitism, and we certainly were NOT privileged.
This proposed curriculum offends me to my core. Now my kids are going to be forced to learn in school that we are "privileged?" That is absolutely and utterly unacceptable. Should this draft go through, you will likely encounter many lawsuits as it incites hate, among other things.
Sincerely, Sepi
