From: Martin Cohn Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 5:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] curriculum Concern
To whom it may concern,
I understand that the curriculum you were looking to review and approve for the future in the state of California has to do with individuals and philosophies that are anti-Semitic. This is a very very very alarming as this is not the type of hatred that we should be teaching children no matter if it's about Judaism, Christianity, Muslim, or any other type of individual.
Please give serious consideration to not changing the curriculum to include any type of antiSemitic or heat pipe curriculum.
There any questions I am available for further conversations.
Thank you,
Marty
