It is a travesty to confuse and divide children on the basis of race, which is exactly what your curriculum does. If you seriously think this will go through without protest and parental blockage, you have another thing coming. Just the fact that you are calling Jewish people privileged is ridiculous on its face. Your description of Jews as being or having any kind of favored status after centuries of genocide, hatred and discrimination shows an neglect of any historical perspective on your part. What about teaching teens how to spell? Or do math? So they can get a decent job. Teaching division and hate will only brings growing children into a warped thought pattern, unless that is what the ultimate goal of this curricula is. We urge you to reconsider teaching this course.
