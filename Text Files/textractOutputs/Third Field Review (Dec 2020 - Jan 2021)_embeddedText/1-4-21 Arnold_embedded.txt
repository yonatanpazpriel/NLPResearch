From: Cee Arnold Sent: Sunday, January 3, 2021 12:46 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I read of the possible updates and changes in history classes within "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. As a student who went to California schools many years ago, it would be helpful if the curriculum while showing the flaws would also show the solutions and those who helped achieve them
It should not just be negative, there always has to be hope that by addressing injustice that it has been corrected in the past, by whom and how is beneficial in order to have hope!
We must always have hope and look to the guiding lights in the past who have found solutions to problems, as Martin Luther King, Jr. did with his peaceful marches and the changes that came afterward throughout the country.
Please let there be lights to look to, not just negativity, we have enough of that in the world today.
Thank you for your time,
Candy L. Arnold
