Hi,
I am a California resident. I am writing this email to strongly oppose Critical Ethnic Study being taught in our public schools. This is a racist curriculum. The class will divide the people instead of uniting them. What's more, this will be a total waste of taxpayer's money!!! We are paying the highest State tax in the nation. But what are we getting here? It seems we are paying for bunch of irresponsible bureaucrats who are doing nothing but brainstorming how to squander public's money for their own interests! I am fed up with them. In fact, my family are thinking about escaping California and move to some other States just because we have too many fat bureaucrats here in California who are good for nothing but skilled at sucking the blood from middle class families in California.
Thanks, Christine
