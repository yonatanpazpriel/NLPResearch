From: COHEN Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:17 AM To: Ethnic Studies; Harris Cohen Subject: [EXTERNAL] California's proposed ethnic studies curriculum
What is created and racist cannot help solve racial misunderstanding. I am deeply disappointed that the flawed ethnic studies curriculum stands as it does. The necessary treatment of white ethnic minorities and their histories in the USA is helpful to the understanding of the fabric of the USA. Ignoring them is inappropriate. The curriculum's adoration of known antisemites or their supporters is inappropriate. The "whitewashing" or should I say "ghosting" of the Jew and his experience from far right and far left racism and the ignoring of his contribution to a better and more understanding USA, in particular, is demeaning. As I read somewhere recently, my people, the Jews, had the "white privilege" of being massacred and killed with impunity til the ultimate sacrifice of 6 million in the holocaust. Not teaching this as part of ethnic studies means an incomplete curriculum. Underlining works and actions by antiJewish people to groups of impressionable children will only lead to further antisemitism (which increases to this day among those with variable skin colors in the USA). Not teaching tolerance in an agenda demeaning white skin as privileged will not lead to a coherent and ethical treatment of others by the learners. Not extolling the virtues of those (Jews) considered white by some haters and nonwhite by other haters and not highlighting their works for racial justice in this nation is a shame and a privilege that should not be given to the leadership of a flawed ethnic studies curriculum. Teach improperly and what is seen as an ethnic studies curriculum may not prevent an ethnic cleansing activity in the future. We must teach tolerance and concern for others well. As is this proposed ethnic studies curriculum does not.
