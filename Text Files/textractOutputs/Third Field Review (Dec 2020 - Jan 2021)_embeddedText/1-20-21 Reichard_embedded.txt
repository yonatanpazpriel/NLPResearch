Subject: Ethnics Study Program
I have a basic problem with the basic assumption that Ethic Studies is limited to people of color, and that all whites are "privileged" and hence should not be included. If you follow this analogy, white skinned people with some dark skinned ancestors should not be covered. Is there a break-point in your DNA results where you are not considered belonging to a colored group? One can be marginalized regardless of skin color. Jews know that only too well. The Nazis considered them a race (an inferior one) which they planned to eliminate, to prevent it from contaminating their Aryan blood. Jews have the most hate crimes committed against them of any group in the US. Do you really want to increase the number of those hate crimes?
Also, I find that there is still an anti-Semitic (anti-Jewish) thread woven though this program, This includes references to "name changing" to gain racial privilege among Jews. Some name changing occurred but mainly due to trying to eliminate attacks due to their name. Some of my relatives changed their name in the US after WWI because it was too German sounding and there was a lot of anti-German sentiment. I know of Holocaust survivors that changed their religion so that their children would not be persecuted as they were. But most people didn't. it wasn't an attempt to "gain privilege" but a way to prevent being attacked and persecuted. Support of Third World Liberation Front group with its antiSemitic supporters should also be questioned. You can have liberation of (I would prefer the term equalization of potential for) "colored" people without having to marginalize other groups.
