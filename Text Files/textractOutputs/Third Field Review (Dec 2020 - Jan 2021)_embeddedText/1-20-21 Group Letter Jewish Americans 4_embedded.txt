From: Tanya Pourshamtobi Emrani Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 7:20 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews and Ethnic Studies
To whom it may concern,
As a Jew of Iranian descent I implore you to drop the term "privilege" from anything having to do with Jews in your ethnic studies program. There is literally nothing privileged about being a Jew in society. We have always been discriminated against and held in no different regard than any other minority race. If anything we are discriminated against in greater length. Even our only home Israel is constantly under fire amongst different movements. We are in no way seen like regular white Christians. Our people have always lived in exile having to start over every time we are kicked out of different countries just for being Jewish. Please help to take the privileged terminology out as it will fuel even more anti Semitism against our people. I am the mother of 3 children (one of whom is a first grader at Warner Avenue Elementary school). As an LAUSD parent I am really hoping you will consider my plea.
Thank you for your time, Tanya Pourshamtobi Emrani
