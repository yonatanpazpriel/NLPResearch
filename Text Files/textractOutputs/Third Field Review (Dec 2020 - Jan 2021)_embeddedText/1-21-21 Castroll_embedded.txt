Please please I beg of you do not repeat history do not make Jews the target of all hatred and the cause of all evil. Do not teach children from pre-K through advanced degrees that Jews are different and the Jews are somehow privileged.. why would you create a world that is biased and putting blame on Jews? Why? Please again I beg of you. Don't do it. Sincerely, Oria Castroll
