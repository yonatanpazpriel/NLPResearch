From: Marc Becker Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 12:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Portrayal of Jews in proposed Ethnic Studies
To the Ethic Studies Commission:
I am sending this email to ask that you strive for accuracy and fairness in the portrayal of American Jews in the proposed Ethnic Studies program.
It's important to acknowledge Jewish contributions to America beginning with the Revolutionary War up through our present era.
Jewish scientists, composers, Supreme Court justices, senators, and artists have all played important roles in the development of our nation.
Jews were instrumental in the creation of the movie industry and have been active in the ongoing civil rights struggle.
It is not helpful or accurate to refer to Jews as a privileged minority. We are the children and grandchildren of immigrants who arrived in the US penniless and had to struggle against antisemitism.
Please tell the story of the Lower East Side in New York where Jewish immigrants first landed in the 20th Century. Many of these early Jewish immigrants were instrumental in creating the labor movement which brought the workplace reforms that we enjoy today.
It is not helpful to extoll the virtues of individuals who espouse antisemitism.
I hope that you will seriously consider these recommendations.
Sincerely,
Marc. S. Becker, Ph.D. Palm Springs, California
