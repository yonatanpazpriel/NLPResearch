From: Marybeth Otani Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 4:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Sub-Speciation
Why is this proposed "Ethnic Studies" curriculum focusing on sub-speciation, when science has disproven the political concept of "race?" What the California curriculum needs is a comprehensive overhaul of the high school "Economics" curriculum. When is going to be OK for students to be taught that the reason that slavery, wage theft, and disenfranchised minority communities exist is for the 1% to steal the labor off of other people using "otherness." Marginalized Americans who are in poverty are placed there by this 1%.
