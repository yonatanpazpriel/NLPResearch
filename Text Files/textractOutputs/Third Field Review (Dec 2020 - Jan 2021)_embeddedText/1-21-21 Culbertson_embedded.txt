I believe the ethnic Studies curriculum needs to address the many inequities in our society by admitting their existence but more importantly, striving to change them to less or non existing negatives by pointing out the positives and advantages of a multi- cultural, multi-racial and/ or religious society that we must all contribute to in sincerely caring ways.
