Teach the kids to survive in this world: Real math, not common core. English, including the use of a dictionary. How to write cursive. Balance a check book. Manners and respect for others. History as it actually happened. Not the version that is watered down so as to not offend any certain sect.
Let them have their 'bumps and bruises'. You learn from failures and pain how to win in life.
Respectfully, Steve Daniel
