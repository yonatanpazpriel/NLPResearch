From: Maurice Hakim Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:42 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum proposal
Your Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum is anti-Semitic racist propaganda in the tradition of the Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. It's a disgraceful, deliberate false statement of facts that will only perpetuate the rabid antiSemitism that is growing in our country. It's insulting to not only the Jewish people in California but to every citizen in our country.
