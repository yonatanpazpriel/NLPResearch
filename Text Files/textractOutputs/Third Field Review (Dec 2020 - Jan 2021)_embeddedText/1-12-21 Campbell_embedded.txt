From: Duane Campbell Sent: Tuesday, January 12, 2021 1:03 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Manuel Lares; Marty Puentes Subject: [EXTERNAL] Response to the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
This is in response to the Ethnic Studies model curriculum draft posted for public review by the California State Board of Education 2021.
The representatives of Sacramento LULAC, local 2862, Sacramento, offer the following critiques.
Chapter 4. Bibliography
The proposed bibliography primarily includes theoretical pedagogical publications while lacking content specific materials. While advocacy pedagogical literature certainly has value, teachers also need background content. The bibliography should be expanded to include some content specific recommendations on the history, sociology, and culture of each of the major groups. For example, for Mexican American/Latino readings should include Occupied America: A History of Chicanos, 8th edition or later by Rodolfo F. Acu�a, From Out of the Shadows: Mexican Women in the Twentieth-century America, by Dr. Vicki Ruiz, and Carlos Mu�oz, Youth, Identity, Power: The Chicano Movement . Sources providing basic historical background are missing from the bibliography. Similar suggestions would improve the usefulness of the bibliography as teachers cover several of the other major ethnic groups.
Appendix A. Sample lessons and topics
The first model lesson recommends a lesson on immigration in current Los Angeles. While this lesson has merit, the sample model lessons should begin with the forced incorporation of the Mexican people living in the Southwest into the United States via the Mexican American War of 1846-1848 and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the Gadsden Purchase.
