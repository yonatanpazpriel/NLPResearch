From: anna piller Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 3:19 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please Do Not Divide Us - Save Ethnic Studies
Dear California Dept of Education, Superintendent of Education Tony Thurmond, and President of the State Board of Education Linda Darling-Hammond,
As a Jewish Bay Area native raising the two Jewish children of my own in Alameda, I am very concerned by the new iteration of the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that nearly erases Arab American history and depoliticizes the experiences of marginalized communities everywhere.
I lost much of my family in the Holocaust and know very well the cost of injustice. How are we to build solidarity with each other to achieve collective liberation if the stories and experiences of Black, brown, and indigenous peoples are not told in their own words? I understand that my own liberation -- which has nothing to do with Zionism -- is bound up with the liberation of all oppressed people, and these actions by the Dept of Education will only serve to divide us.
What my children -- and all children, regardless of background -- need is solidarity and education that instills a commitment to the anti-colonial, anti-racist values of Ethnic Studies. I hope you will restore Arab American Studies to its rightful place in Asian American Studies, and restore the agency of Ethnic Studies experts in creating a truly liberatory curriculum.
Thank you, Anna Piller
