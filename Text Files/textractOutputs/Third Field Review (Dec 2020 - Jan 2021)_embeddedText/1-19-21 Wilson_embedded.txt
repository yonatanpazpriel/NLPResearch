From: Erica Wilson Sent: Monday, January 18, 2021 7:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Crucial Race Study
To Whom it May Concern,
I'd like to write concerning the inclusion of Critical Race Theory in the K-12 Curriculum.
I wish it were not so divisive an issue, but very simply, it is. Very. Divisive. Until Critical Race Theory as a subject can be apolitical and unbiased, it cannot justifiably be included in any serious educational system.
Please do not allow this subject matter to be prosthelytized in our school system, and stick instead to core subjects. Subjects which will be truly useful to graduates after their public school experience.
Thank you for your consideration,
Erica Wilson
