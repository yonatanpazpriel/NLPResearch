From: Mark Zhen Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:25 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Objection to the Ethnic Studies curriculum in K-12
To whom it may concern,
As a father of two minority young children, I object to the idea to teach/introduce racial/ethnic studies in the K-12 schools. I believe in a society that values individual efforts and choices, regardless of its achievements and consequences. K-12 curriculum should focus on the skills and characters of the students that make them more responsible for themselves. I don't believe that the racial or ethnical prejudice in our society is a constant factor for inequity although I won't deny that there are cases of injustice. The point is that do we want to plant the idea of racial barriers to the young kids instead of building their confidence in their individual and common merit of hard work?
Please exclude the harmful curriculum from the K-12 schools.
Sincerely, Mark Zhen
