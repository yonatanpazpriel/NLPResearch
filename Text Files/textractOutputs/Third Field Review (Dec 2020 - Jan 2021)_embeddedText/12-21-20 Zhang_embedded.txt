From: Lei Zhang Sent: Friday, December 18, 2020 10:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Don't Let Ethnic Studies Be Hijacked By A Narrow Political Agenda
Dear Sir/Madam,
I write this letter to you with great dismay, and great concern for the perversion of history that is being perpetrated by the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). If this model curriculum is approved, it will inflict great harm on millions of students in our state.
Sincerely yours, Lei Zhang
