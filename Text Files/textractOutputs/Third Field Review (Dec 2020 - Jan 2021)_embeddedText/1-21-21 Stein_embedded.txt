From: Stein, Leah Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 8:34 PM To: Stein, Leah; Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum -- COMMENT
To Whom It May Concern,
I am deeply concerned and bothered by the proposed depiction of Jews in the new Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
Proposing a discussion of Jews in an Ethnic Studies course and not including detailed information about the Holocaust and the history and continued prevalence of anti-Semitism is horrifying. Stating that Jews are able to 'pass' as white and thereby gain racial privilege is also incredibly problematic -- I, as a white skinned Jew, have experienced anti-Semitic encounters since I was in elementary school -- Elementary School. I was singled out on the school bus and told I couldn't sit in the seat I had chosen because I was a 'dirty Jew' and we weren't allowed to be in those seats. I was 10. Although that memory clearly has stuck with me until today, it is relatively minor in the spectrum of possible anti-Semitic encounters -- to contrast, my husband's cousin was murdered for being Jewish. MURDERED.
Please, please, please change the content about Jews in the proposed curriculum. The current content benefits no one -- other than those who are happy to add more reasons why they should hate Jews to their repertoire.
Best, Leah Stein Duker
