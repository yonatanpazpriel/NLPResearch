From: Carole and Steve Sent: Tuesday, December 22, 2020 11:39 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] curriculum
We support a diverse and objective ethnic curriculum for students to learn about the positive accomplishments of the USA with optimism for a bright future. American is the country where many people around the world would love to live for good reason. We do not want to hear about our history being changed with biased narratives. Revise the curriculum as it stands to present our history in the positive view it deserves. Carole and Steve Lane
