My name is Daniel Dintzer, a graduate of UCLA, and UCLA Law School, and am writing to complain about the proposed definition, in your Ethnic studies proposal, and how it doesn't address the Anti-Semitism and Jew hatred that has run rampant throughout California, especially in the educational institutions. A clear and concise unequivocal statement about how Anti-Zionism and Anti-Semitism are both rejected and won't be tolerated, must be part of the definition of unacceptable prejudice in our State. A reference to "Jewish Privilege" is intolerable. As the most discriminated against of all People in history, using that term relative to Jews is wrong and abhorrent. Rethink what you're doing!
