This is completely wrong! The agenda is to make white people or any other race other then who you decide ( HUMAN BEINGS ) feel guilty for their race and this makes you wrong! The Critical Race Theory curriculum proposed by the SBE, is itself racist, it does not unify, it does not empower, and it would actually harm children.
