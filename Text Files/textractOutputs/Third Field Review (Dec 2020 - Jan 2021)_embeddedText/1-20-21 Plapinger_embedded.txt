From: Arlene Plapinger Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:52 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] the proposed California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
There apparently is a bias in this proposed curriculum toward anti-semitism that is totally inappropriate. It must NOT be approved as is.
This is 2021 and you are not more aware of the need for acceptance of all peoples? How can this even be proposed for approval? Shocking!
Sincerely, Arlene Plapinger
