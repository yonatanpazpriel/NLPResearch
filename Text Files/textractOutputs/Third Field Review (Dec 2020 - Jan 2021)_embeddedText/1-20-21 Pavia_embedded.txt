Re: Urban Peace Movement's OPPOSITION to Current Revisions of CA ESMC
Dear Superintendent Thurmond,
On behalf of Urban Peace Movement, I am writing in opposition to the current version of the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC), which does not live up to the values, principles and pedagogy of Ethnic Studies. Essential Ethnic Studies terminology, including the definition of race, has been eliminated, incorrectly defined, or moved to the footnotes. The decolonial, antiracist, and liberatory focus of Ethnic Studies has been buried in an avalanche of vague and contradictory language. And Arab American Studies has been moved from its rightful place in Asian American/Pacific Islander Studies to an "interethnic bridge-building appendix." We share the anger of our Arab siblings that their history and community has been relegated to an appendix.
As an organization that prioritizes the needs of our community, Ethnic Studies is foundational to the education of our youth.
Urban Peace Movement builds the leadership of low income youth of color throughout Alameda County. The vast majority of our youth members are either formerly incarcerated or have loved ones directly impacted by the legal system. In order to help them understand the broader system of mass incarceration, we rely on Ethnic Studies curriculum and pedagogy. Students who have taken Ethnic studies classes in their high schools have often said it was their favorite class because it taught them a more truthful story of the world. We, too, know it is important to be truthful in telling the history of Black and Brown communities in the U.S. and around the world. For these reasons, we are in opposition to the current version of the ESMC.
We are also concerned that the Ethnic Studies educators who wrote the original ESMC have been sidelined, while politicians and lobbyists have wielded the most influence in what revisions get made. The sidelining of the original committee echoes an all-too-familiar experience amongst people of color of having our expertise denied.
We are echoing and uplifting the demands of the Save Arab American Studies Coalition, and taking the lead from Ethnic Studies educators:
� Re-empower experts in the field of Ethnic Studies to decide on revisions to the ESMC that align with the principles, values, and pedagogy of Ethnic Studies.

� Put Arab American Studies--including Palestine--back where it belongs, within the Asian American Studies section of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
� Approve an ESMC that is anti-racist, decolonial and liberatory--that centers the voices and experiences of communities of color and their struggles for liberation.
We call on the CA Department of Education to take immediate action to protect the integrity of Ethnic Studies. We want a curriculum that meets the needs of our youth and carries on the spirit of the original 1968 Third World Liberation Front and Black Student Union strikes that led to Ethnic Studies as a discipline. It is not too late to stand with us on the right side of history and support an ESMC that will educate, protect, and inspire all our children.
Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
