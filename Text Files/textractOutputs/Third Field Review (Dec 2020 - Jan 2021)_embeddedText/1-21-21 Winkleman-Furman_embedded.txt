From: [email redacted] Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 9:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Don't approve curriculum in current state.
The current ethnic studies curriculum is limited to a select group of CA ethnic groups. What about my ethnic group? The curriculum excludes many groups: Hindus, Sikhs, Koreans, Armenians , and my community ï¿½ Jews. The curriculum only covers historical anti-semitism or it's expression today, in a superficial manner. The curriculum pushes sectarian divisions and will do nothing to unify Californians. In spite of a revision process, the net result is nothing but divisive.
