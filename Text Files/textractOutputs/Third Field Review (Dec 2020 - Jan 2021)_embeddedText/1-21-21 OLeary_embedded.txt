From: David, Congregation Beth Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jewish Representation in the Ethnic Studies Curriculum
I am very disturbed by the representation of Jewish Americans in the proposed curriculum. As a former teacher, a parent of school aged children, and most importantly a Jew I find the current curriculum discussing Jewish assimilation and privilege to be alarming and highly anti-Semetic.
Our nation has an ugly history of anti-Semitism that has reared it's ugly head again in the past few years. A curriculum that treats Jews as an elite minority afforded all the rights of white Christian Americans is not only inaccurate, it is dangerous. Remember that it was this type of rhetoric that became popular in pre-World War II Germany.
I urge you to rethink this curriculum with input from the Jewish community.
L'Shalom--
