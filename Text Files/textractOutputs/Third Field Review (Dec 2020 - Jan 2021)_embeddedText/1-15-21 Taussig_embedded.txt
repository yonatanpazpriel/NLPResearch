Hello,
First, I want to thank you for including Ethnics studies in the California curriculum. I am proud to live in a state that celebrates ethnic diversity, and teaches dialogue and compassion. I think these should be the focus of ethnic studies: teach our kids that they should explore differences, learn more about people who are not like them, respect other cultures, and celebrate them. Ethnic studies should dive into historic conflicts around ethnicity, like the holocaust, or apartheid in South Africa. And the focus should be on what we can do to prevent such conflicts in the future.
I am an Israeli Jew. I disapprove and criticize Israel for many of its ethnic policies and actions. However, the ArabIsraeli conflict is very complex. I do not think it has a place in California's ethnic studies, because without going very deep into the roots of the conflict, history of each side - it will be a shallow discussion that would result in more hate and less love for people who are different.
Thank you, Elinor Taussig, Palo Alto
