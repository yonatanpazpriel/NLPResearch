To Whom it May Concern,
It was recently brought to my attention that California intends to impose a mandatory ethnic studies curriculum on students. It was pointed out that Jews will be considered a "white" privileged class. This must certainly be a JOKE. Any person who bothers to delve into European history will learn this is not the case. To put forth any ideas that vilify any group is horrendous and frankly racist.
Given the current cultural divisions in our American Society right now, I'm deeply disappointed that educators believe that such a curriculum is productive. I urge you to reconsider any educational curriculum in which any ethnic or religious group are deemed privileged and vilified. I strongly urge our educators to change the language in which "race" is talked about. Further escalation of hostilities is a dangerous path for the stability of our society.
Certainly educating all children on the cultures and accomplishments of non european peoples is a productive way to open minds to others. But to condemn another group is not. Once again I urge that you resist the current and dangerous cultural use of the term "white privilege". The rights of all groups of people should be respected in the education of our children. I have traveled the world my entire life. The one constant that I have discovered is just how similar we all are.
History is long and complex. There are no winners in where one group is put before another. Shame on those who propose to do so. Even the best intentions in this regard have never worked. Remember history.
With regards.
