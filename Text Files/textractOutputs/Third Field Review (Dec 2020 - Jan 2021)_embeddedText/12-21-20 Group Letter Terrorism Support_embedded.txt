Dear CUNY,
I'm extremely disturbed by the recent Professional Staff Congress resolution that supports Leila Khaled, an archterrorist. Academic freedom is important, but it is also just as important not to promote and incite to violence. Leila Khaled contiues to promote terrorism, and still is celebrated for her crimes. How do you think it makes her victims feel that CUNY supports people like this? I hope the rest of the administration does not support terrorism, because this is unacceptable.
