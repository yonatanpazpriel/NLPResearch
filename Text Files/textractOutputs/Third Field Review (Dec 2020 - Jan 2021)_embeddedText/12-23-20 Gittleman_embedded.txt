I write as a teacher, parent and a Jew.
Thank you for including the 2 lessons in antisemitism in the new ethnic studies curriculum. I face this issue at work as a teacher.
We should address this at all grade levels.
Please include BINAH-Building Insights to Navigate antisemitism and Hate
This portion guides students as to what to do when they experience this?
I barely know what to do myself, especially when facing this issue. [advertising link redacted] Best, Nancy
