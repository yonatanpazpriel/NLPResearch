From: David Edwards Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 10:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti Semitism
Dear Ethnic Studies Curriculum Staff,
As a young Jew, especially one who just witnessed Nazi imagery in our very National Capitol, who has seen Anti Semitism express itself as ma// shootings, graffiti, the doxing of an entire Jewish high school's students and the hacking of their website, who has received Anti Semitic threats by individuals on the streets of Los Angeles, and most of all whose family was massacred by Europeans for their "un-whiteness," I find the way the curriculum designates Jewish "white privilege," and especially singles them out, and it's promotion of Anti-Semites, totally unacceptable and absolutely horrifying.
Jewish Americans feel the beginnings of what led to our fate less than 80 years ago roaring in America. I am sure your committee understands the importance of education for healing this country, which is why you have taken on the surely not easy but surely important task of education Californians about Ethnic Studies. Sadly, in the same way the Nazi's poisoned their youth with messages about Jews, and watched as those same young minds committed atrocities, I can't help but fear the same given these disturbing curricula.
I implore you to think deeply about these decisions and the ramifications they can have for the future. Please hear the call of Jews to ensure our safety and prevent rather than promote Anti Semitism in America, because if there is anyone who can help educate about these vital issues, it is you and your colleagues.
Thank you,
David Edwards
