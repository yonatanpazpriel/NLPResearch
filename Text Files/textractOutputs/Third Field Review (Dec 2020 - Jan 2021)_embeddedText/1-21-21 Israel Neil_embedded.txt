From: Harvey Berg Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:30 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment on Ethnic Studies Curriculum
The only 'privilege' Jews have after all the centuries of hate directed at them is to be able to object to anti-semetic categorization such as the description that's proposed in the new curricula. Any privilege we have we've obtained not from skin color but from hard work and contribution to whatever society takes us in. We are not white. We are not trying to pass. We are who we are. Sorry we're so difficult to pin down. We're of middle eastern decent despite all the stops along the varied routes of the diaspora. We're not Anglo Saxon or Nordic or Slavic or from any other group that one can describe as Caucasian. Like our Arab brothers and sisters (no one calls them 'white' by the way) we come from the same family tree. Stop politicizing education and teach facts not hate. --Neil Israel
