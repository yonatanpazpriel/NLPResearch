I understand that you are working on a curriculum for ethnic studies for the students of California. It is my hope that in this era of equity and equality and a time for change that we help students understand the facts of history. In order to move forward we need to give our students a solid historical foundation and not pit different groups against each other and not set them up with bias. We need to focus on racism, anti-semitism, teach them about slavery, the holocaust and the civil rights movement, teach them about the dark moments in history and how our work is not done.
Thank you for your time.
