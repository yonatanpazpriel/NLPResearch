From: Roberta Scharlin Zinman Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 8:50 PM To: Ethnic Studies; Gmail; Reardon, Rhonda; [emails redacted] Subject: [EXTERNAL] FW: anti-Semitism continues in your proposed curriculum. WHY???
I HAVE COMMENTED ON THE PROPOSED CURRICULUM WRITTEN YOUR GROUP MANY TIMES PRIOR TO THIS. SO HAVE OTHER JEWS WHO HAVE QUESTONED THE CONTINUING PROBLEM OF ANTI-SEMITSM IN THIS PROGRAM. You have done NOTHING to remove the objectional parts. Rather, you have added to them or merely changed words while giving the same impression to impressionable children: JEWS ARE BAD. THEY ARE WHITE AND PRIVILEGED. PERIOD. You admit that there is overt anti-Semitism in this curriculum. You no longer try to hide the fact that you desire this program to be anti-Semitic in its content and in its effect. SHAME ON YOU. YOU ARE NO BETTER THAN THE NAZIS IN GERMANY AND THEIR ANTI-SEMITIC PROPADANGA AGAINST JEWS AND THE JEWISH PEOPLE!!
To quote two well spoken and correct critics of your work, AND WITH WHICH I COMPLETELY AGREE:
In the midst of the largest recorded surge in anti-Semitic propaganda and attacks against Jewish people across the globe, a new framework for racial theory again counts Jews as members of the evil class. Jews, who represent roughly 0.2% of the world's population and roughly 2% of the U.S. population, are again targeted for their "privilege." Yet, when concerns are raised about the ways in which critical ethnic studies programs promote this type of hatred, the authors of Rethinking Ethnic Studies write, "such strong feelings are part of students' sense-making and development."
