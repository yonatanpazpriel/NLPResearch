I am very opposed to putting this kind of program into the school system. It is political commentary that belongs at a much higher grad level, if at all. It is vital they are learning actual history, and spending more time on reading, writing and arithmetic. Please do not require or offer this program. Jeanette Fenton Concerned parent
