It's absolutely absurd that you're actually considering this curriculum which is very anti-Semitic to put in the schools curriculum here in California. You even have speakers who were anti-Semitic in your curriculum. Hopefully won't do this or you'll get a lot of negative feedback from parents, Jewish groups, and many Jews who are learning about this.
