Dear State Board of Education, As a former substitute teacher and holder of a Master of Fine Arts Degree, I urge you NOT to approve Critical Race Theory. This theory will promote racism, not solve it. Anytime you identify people by race, you diminish their view of themselves as united in the human family. It becomes an "us versus them" mentality. It promotes hatred and victimhood thinking, which is a crippling, disabling mindset. My black friends were outraged when Affirmative Action was adopted. They felt, rightly so, that its proponents believed they had to "make it easier" for blacks to gain college admission, jobs, etc. How insulting. Even filling out an application that asks for race contributes to this notion that one group is "less" than another. This is at the very heart of racism! Please vote AGAINST this ridiculous theory. Thank you, Joni Hilton
