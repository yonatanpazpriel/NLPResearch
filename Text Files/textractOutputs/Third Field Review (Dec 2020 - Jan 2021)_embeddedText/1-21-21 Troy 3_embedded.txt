From: Lindsey Troy Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:36 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Remove the word `privilege' from curriculum
This is what `Jewish privilege' looks like. These were light-skinned, white-passing Jews who had assimilated into society. By saying ashkenazi Jews have any sort of privilege is vile and dishonest, and will allow history to repeat itself. Remove the word privilege from the proposed curriculum when talking about light-skinned Jews. Don't cave to the pressure of antisemitic groups who want anti-Israel propaganda in the curriculum. Give an unbiased education to children so that history doesn't repeat itself.
Sincerely,
Lindsey Troy
