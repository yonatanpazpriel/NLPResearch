From: Jon Glaser Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:39 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am appalled and deeply offended by the proposed curriculum changes as they related to describing Jews.
The words are beyond offensive. They are dangerous and reminiscent of Nazi propaganda in the 30's that lead to mass genocide. That the words attempt to distinguish Jews based on color tones of skin is shocking. Imagine the outrage if these words were used to describe any other community?
That Jews changing their names to change is seen solely motivated by an attempt to climb the social hierarchy shows a complete lack of understanding of Jewish history. Maybe Jews wanted to sound less Jewish to avoid persecution?. ..perhaps a somewhat rational reaction after 6mm of them were murdered and after centuries of pogroms and other anti-sematic acts. And in any event, so what? I can name dozens of people of all races and color who change their names for all kinds of reasons. SO WHAT!
Ethnic studies should promote an understanding of different cultures and the historical hardships and glory of each community. Your curriculum perpetuates division and is riddled with inaccurate academic baseless nonsense. I imagine my "privileged" dead ancestors in Romania read similar descriptions of Jews in the 1930s.
Shame on you!
