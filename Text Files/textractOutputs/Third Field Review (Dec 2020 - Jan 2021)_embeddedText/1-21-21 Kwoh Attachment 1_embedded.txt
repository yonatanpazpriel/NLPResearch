Lesson Overview:
This lesson explores the topics of Japanese American incarceration and redress, and its relation to the definition of an "American", rights, and the census. Definitions of race, nationality, ethnicity, and rights are explained to define "American". The lesson also explains how Constitutional rights are basic human rights granted to all people regardless of citizenship as well as the differences that benefit an American citizen. To further analyze Japanese incarceration camps, studying the census will explain its role in carrying out Executive Order 9066 as well as how the laws have changed to protect all Americans. Lastly, students will review the Civil Liberties Act of 1988 to understand how the American government apologized for the treatment of Japanese Americans.

Nationality, Ethnicity, Race, Constitutional Rights Essay:
On February 19th, 1942, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 to initiate the mass removal of Japanese Americans into what developed into incarceration camps. Japanese Americans continuously had their rights violated throughout the World War II era and afterwards. The Civil Liberties Act of 1988, a formal apology by the U.S. government, acknowledged and made restitution for the treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Of the 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry who were incarcerated, two-thirds (over 70,000) were American-born citizens.
But what does it mean to be American?
Geographic identification of an American applies to anyone from North and South America as these two continents were named after the explorer Amerigo Vespucci.
However, the term "American" generally refers to someone from the United States of America. You may consider a person's nationality, place of birth which makes the person a member of that nation.
The social identification of an American includes words such as race and ethnicity. National Geographic defines race as usually associated with biology and linked with physical characteristics such as skin color or hair texture. Ethnicity is linked with cultural expression and identification. These terms are social constructs � defined by the people who hold power and not by one's genetic makeup.
Then, there's the political definition of an American - citizenship. According to the U.S. Constitution, there are two paths to become a U.S. citizen: birthright and naturalization. Birthright citizenship refers to all persons born in the United States (or born to American parents), whereas naturalization refers to a person who completed the legal process to become a citizen. American citizenship entails specific rights, duties, and benefits. Ultimately, the definition of an American is complicated and varies dependent on if the question is regarding race, ethnicity, nationality, and citizenship.
Throughout American history until the Civil Rights era, the American government enacted policies to limit and restrict immigration and citizenship of many ethnic groups.
What does this have to do with Japanese incarceration? At the time of the United States' entry to World War II in 1941, the nissei (the second generation or the American-born children of the issei) were citizens of the United States by birthright even though the issei (first generation of immigrants from Japan) were barred from citizenship. Although the U.S. government did not always protect all persons equally, the U.S. Constitution lists many rights for all people regardless of citizenship. In fact, non-citizens are also protected under all the rights listed in the Bill of Rights. Strictly speaking, the word "citizen" is not used in the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution (Amendments 1-10) but rather the words "person", "people" or the "accused". Therefore, all people regardless of citizenship or residency are protected by Constitutional law including rights such as due process and freedom from unreasonable searches. All people of Japanese ancestry who were incarcerated had their rights violated.
It is important to remember the Japanese American incarceration camps to avoid repeating history. It is critical to exercise your rights and partake in civic engagement to hold elected representatives and their

Excerpts from the Article "Americans in Concentration Camps" by Harry Paxton Howard. This article is from the September 1942 issue of the quarterly magazine The Crisis. The NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) was founded in 1909. The following year, the NAACP started publishing their quarterly magazine The Crisis. Below are excerpts from the article complied by Asian Americans Advancing Justice Los Angeles and UCLA Asian American Studies Center.
Excerpt 1 - Filth and Squalor

AdvancingJustice-LA.org/LessonPlans

5

There was no direct torture. It was an American, not a Nazi, concentration camp. Some of the older inhabitants ... suffered from insufficiency of their customary rice.... lacking tubs, buckets, washing machines, or sufficient soap. Perpetually dusty and dirty eyes were painful and "troublesome." Babies found unwashed diapers painful as well as odorous. ... children sickened and died, living in a filth and squalor.... But there was no "torture." ...
Excerpt 2: It Concerns the Negro What has happened to these Americans in recent months is of direct concern to the American Negro. For the barbarous treatment of these Americans is the result of the color line. .... These men, women, and children have been taken from their pleasant homes and long- cultivated farms and businesses because their skins are yellow .... Americans of German or Italian descent ... are not being stuck into filthy and noisome shacks in vile concentration camps because they are of German and Italian ancestry; they are white....
Negros have been told again and again "Work quietly, be industrious, mind your own business, and you will get justice even in America." That is what these yellow-skinned Americans believed. They worked, cheerfully and industriously. They turned deserts into beautiful and fertile farmland, grew vegetables and fruits for themselves and for others. They distinguished themselves at school, abstained from politics, had the lowest crime-rate of any group in the entire country. They earned the respect of all decent white persons ....
What has been their reward? They have been plundered of everything, and crowded in concentration camps fit only for pigs. ... And if native-born Americans of Asiatic descent can be denied all civil rights and civil liberties, what about Americans of African descent? ...
This is an integral part of the struggle for human and racial equality. It concerns every Negro. It concerns every believer in democracy and human equality, regardless of color.
