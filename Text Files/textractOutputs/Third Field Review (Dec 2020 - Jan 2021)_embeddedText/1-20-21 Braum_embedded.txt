From: Daniel Braum Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:04 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] "Jewish Privilege"
Hello,
Please remove "Jewish Privilege" from your curriculum. It supposes that Jewish People have an extra privilege, I find this very offensive.
Thank you for the consideration,
