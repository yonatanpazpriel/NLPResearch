From: Daniel Feiman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:35 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Proposed, state-wide, mandatory Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Good morning:
I assume your intention is not to promote anti-Semitism, hate or misinformation, yet that is exactly what your proposed curriculum will do with the proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions". Please do not use historic anti-Semitic language such as whiteness or white privilege when talking about Jews, as you do. ["sometimes have experienced conditional whiteness and privilege,�(page 494 of 563)] These dog whistle terms are inappropriate, hurtful & set up a oppressor/victim scenario where no one wins.
Please rethink you terminology, intent, purpose & wording before you doom the next generation or two to unwarranted & unjustified hate.
Thank you,
Daniel Feiman, MBA, CMC�
