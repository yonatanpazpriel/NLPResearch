In these times of increasing hate and hate crimes against Jews, thank you for listing antisemitism as a form of bigotry in the ESMC. I urge the use of the definition of antisemitism to be as defined by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. It's important to have full transparency in the development of the final ESMC, and an opportunity for public comment of the final version. In the time of such division and hatred in our Nation, we need to soundly
address overt and subtle anti-Jewish and anti Israel bias. We need a pedagogically sound Ethnic Studies course that will promote respect among students by teaching about the diverse histories, cultures, and contributions to our nation. Thank you for ensuring antisemitic bias has no place in our classrooms! Wendy Harris Santa Clara, CA
