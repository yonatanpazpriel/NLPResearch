From: Walter Lorente Sent: Monday, December 21, 2020 11:43 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California's "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum"
I am an American of Hispanic decent. I attended California schools from 2nd through 12th grade. I attended school when students were not identified by the color of their skin. The teachers treated us as Americans and taught us to read, write, math, art, music, and physical education. No ethnic education was necessary because I learned that from my parents. Since, I am a first generation American, born in El Paso, Texas, my parents spoke Spanish, and listened to Spanish radio stations. My parents couldn't help us with our homework because my father attended school only to the 3rd grade, and my mother attended school through the 6 grade. Parents & their children want to be AMERICANS, that's why they come here; they can learn their ethnic background from their parents. Please teach our children the GOOD that America has accomplished; we have many, many heroes. Yes, we have failed in the past but we have also improved; no country is perfect. I have always been proud to be an American because I was taught the good that America has done. Thank you. Mrs. Armida Lorente
