Re: Please Change the Current Ethnic Studies Model! Dear ESMC Public Comment Inbox, Dear Educators: I worked at SF State for 15 years and saw first hand how segregating Jewish Studies from Ethnic Studies, led to mistrust and deterioration of understanding between the various groups within Ethnic Studies. I strongly believe that Jewish Studies should definitely be included within Ethnic Studies. Separating the groups does great harm, long term. Not only did I work at SF State, but I was a student there for two years and took Jewish Studies classes, along with classes in Asian American Studies. I could never understand why Jewish Studies was separated from the rest of the Ethic Studies groups. It served to create divisions within the students and the faculty. It's long overdue for change. Please include Jewish Studies within Ethnic Studies. It will go a long way towards building a better a future society where the different groups get along. Right now, walls are built around the various groups. Tear down these walls and let the different groups meet and cooperate with each other. Thank you for your hard work and efforts to revise and improve the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). The latest ESMC draft contains key changes and additions that I urge you to maintain, including: Richard Kay Sincerely, Richard Kay
