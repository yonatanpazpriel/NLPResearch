Representatives & administrators,
A robust and expansive, unapologetic Ethnic Studies program is paramount to an inclusive, Democratic society.
Efforts to attack ethnic studies are based in Write Supremacy, either passively or actively.
The whole story of America and ALL Americans needs to be known by the public for our society to transcend our legacy of colonial settler racism.
We can be a better nation by being honest and open about our history. Hiding it will only continue to foster ignorance and racial prejudice.
Do the right thing, and embrace a powerful Ethnic Studies Program for California.
Sincerely, Alexandros Acedo Fresno Social Studies Teacher
