I'm writing to caution CDE against adopting the definitions of antisemitism included in Lesson Plan 40 Antisemitism and Jewish Middle Eastern-Americans without additional explanatory material. The lesson plan quotes the definition of antisemitism developed by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance without mentioning the problematic examples that IHRA uses to illustrate antisemitism. These examples are widely known to be aimed at silencing criticism of Israel and its policies by labeling such criticism as antisemitic. Should teachers or students look into the IHRA definition more deeply, they will certainly encounter these examples.
The lesson plan should be modified to use the definitions without referencing IHRA or the AntiDefinition League or it should add material about explaining that these organizations use charges of antisemitism to silence criticism of Israel.
