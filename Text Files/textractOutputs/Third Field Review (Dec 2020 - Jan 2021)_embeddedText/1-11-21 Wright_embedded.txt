I'm 78 years old and hope my grandchildren will never have to listen to this cr+p. We as free citizens can pick and choose our futures. We are not victims or oppressors. I owned and ran a small company in El Monte, CA for many years (37) and hired many people. That means the workers worked for a fair wage, had health insurance, got breaks and enjoyed a pleasant working atmosphere. They were not victims. And it means I gambled my money, emotions and family's fate on the success of that company. That does not mean I was an oppressor. Please California, stop digging a hole. You (the California Government) seems determined to destroy the population by pitting them against themselves. Wake up.Treat the population as if they are adult enough to pick their own way through life. We don't need you to guide us.
