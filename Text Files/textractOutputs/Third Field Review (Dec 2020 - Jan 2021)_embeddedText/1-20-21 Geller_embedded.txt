From: Lester Geller Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear All People,
Being a 2nd Generation Holocaust surviver and who lost everyone in my family by gas chamber, oven, being buried alive or firing squad. I think it would be I'll advised to teach or have a class in California`s proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum which are all lies and exaggerations. Please think what this curriculum will create hate and injustice and all races would suffer. I am a BLM Supporter. Stay safe and well.
Sincerely,
Les Geller
