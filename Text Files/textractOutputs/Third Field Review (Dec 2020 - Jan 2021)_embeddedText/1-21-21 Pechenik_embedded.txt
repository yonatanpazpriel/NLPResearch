Greetings! California has an opportunity to contribute to reduction of racism and antisemitism. Its about time that old lies and accusations are replaced by factual objective information, so that young people have a chance to be free from anti semitic prejudice. The way that section on Jews reads now, the opposite is more likely an outcome. Holocaust is drifting into the past. But many still remember that six million people, majority of them so called white passing Jews, were viciously killed. That is hardly a privilege. White passing Jews in United States were just as discriminated against as blacks in terms of where they can eat or live. Yet in proposed version of curriculum the word "privilege" only appears in the section about the Jews. In other words, proposed version of curriculum is poised to help continue raising generations of people suspicious of Jews and susceptible to conspiracy theories. Please revise this curriculum and rewrite the section about the Jews in more factually accurate and less accusatory form. Thank you. Irina Pechenik
