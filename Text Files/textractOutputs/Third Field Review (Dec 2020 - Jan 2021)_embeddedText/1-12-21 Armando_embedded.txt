From: Armando Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 7:29 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] We are not victims
Please stop this racist agenda. I am from Mexican decent and we are NOT victims. Our future depends on our efforts, not a handout from society. It is insulting that we get treated differently based on race. Feels like, "poor brown people cannot succeed without our help"
Do not destroy our children
