As a parent with a public-school kid, I just want to say please stop the critical race theory. I already have to teach my kid math and literature, and now I also have to teach him history to fill in the gaps you refuse to? Why can't we just have public school education that can meet international standards? Other countries certainly don't spend as much money as we do on public schools, and yet they get better results!
Thanks Ellen
