From: Dale Futoran Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:49 PM To: Ethnic Studies Cc: Dale Futoran Subject: [EXTERNAL] Provide an ethnic studies curriculum to include history and cultural Jewish life. Education is the answer to fighting against antisemitism.
Jewish history demonstrates antisemitism at its worst. In the midst of the largest recorded surge in anti-Semitic propaganda and attacks against Jewish
people across the globe, a new framework for racial theory again counts Jews as members of the evil class. Ethnic studies programs are offered for blacks and
latinos. Education is an answer to to prevent misguided prejudice and violence against people who have struggled, strived and thrived against insurmountable
odds over thousands of years. It is time that California educational systems provide an ethnic studies curriculum to include history and cultural Jewish life.
