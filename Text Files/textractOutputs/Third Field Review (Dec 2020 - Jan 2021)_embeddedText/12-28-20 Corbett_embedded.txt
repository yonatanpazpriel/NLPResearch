Thank you for requiring two lesson plans on Jewish Americans, antisemitism and hate. Please retain these lesson to build insight and understanding. Antisemitism is a form of bigotry and oppression and results in crimes and incidents where Jewish people are targeted. Core values of Jews include equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectation of public education.
