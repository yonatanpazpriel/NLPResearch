I have heard controversy surrounding your Ethnic Studies Curriculum and wanted to see for myself what it was. I have to imagine that the fact that I CANNOT find it anywhere on your website, but can only find why you are creating it, you must be hiding something you don't want people to see this concerns me. As a mother, I want to understand what you are proposing to my Jewish daughter about her heritage. I find it odd that you aren't meeting with leaders of the community to get their personal perspectives on how they have been treated or marginalized as Jewish Americans in developing this curriculum either. It must be difficult and completely UNethical for you to create this in a vacuum. Please send me the link to actually review this curriculum and decide if I should move out of state - like so many others are doing.
Best, Jess
