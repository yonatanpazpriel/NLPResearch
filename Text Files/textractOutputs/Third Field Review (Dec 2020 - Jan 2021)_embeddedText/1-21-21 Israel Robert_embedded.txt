From: Robert Israel Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 2:40 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews and Privilege
There ought to be no discussion about Jews and privilege that doesn't begin by talking about the historically enacted and repeated genocidal ideology that revolves around Jews and privilege. For an ethnic studies curriculum to go traipsing through that discourse without a single mention of its ugly and bloody history is not a lesson about antiSemitism.
Anti-semetism is alive and well, and on the rise, in this country. Regardless of the color of the Jewish individual. And that needs to be acknowledged.
Many resent American Jews because of politics in Israel - and it is expressed as anti-Jewish, not anti-Zionist.
Also, it is wrong that in ths curriculum only Jews are associated with the word "privilege".
Please address these changes immediately.
Thank you,
Robert Israel
