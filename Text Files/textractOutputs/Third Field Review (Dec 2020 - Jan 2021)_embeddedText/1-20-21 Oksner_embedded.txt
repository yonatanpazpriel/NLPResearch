From: Trisha Oksner Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 7:06 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Curriculum Deadline of Thursday
To Whom it may concern,
I read the Jewish Journal's article about the curriculum under review for the state of California (https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/327667/jews-have-until-thursday-to-influence-ethnic-studiescurriculum/?fbclid=IwAR1EaVl5eY19o3Sq4VX97Y-Dse7Vs05RkxDG05GNOckQVCm6dvQMbG2bmSs).
As a California educator, parent of current K-12 students in California, and as a Jew, I am appalled at the perpetuation of anti-Semitism in our school system. I IMPLORE you to re-evaluate the planned curriculum and to include the opinions of educators and scholars in the intended texts (and no, not just right-wing scholars).
You have the responsibility to educate the next generation. We cannot continue the level of ignorance and hatred that has been normalized in our society. You have the power to change that for the better.
Do better.
Signed, Trisha Oksner
