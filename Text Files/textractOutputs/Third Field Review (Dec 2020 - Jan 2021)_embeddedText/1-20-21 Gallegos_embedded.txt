From: Gail Gallegos Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Opposed to Critical Race Theory for children
Dear dept. members: I am opposed to the teaching of Critical Race Theory to our young children. I feel children should focus on learning the skills they get from the basics - Reading, Writing, Math and Science.
I have seen far too many people coming into the workplace, who do not have basic reading or writing skills, and all complain of not knowing their math. These things were taught to all students many years ago, and we did not have the declining literacy levels that we have now.
Please keep education to the basics, and when people are older they can seek out this type of education as an alternative.
If we want to set up our kids to do well in life, they need basic skills in Reading, Writing and Mathematics.
Sincerely,
Gail Gallegos [address redacted] Carmichael CA
