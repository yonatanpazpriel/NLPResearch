From: Margaret Kallman Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 3:09 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
Dear Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond, members of the State Board of Education, and Superintendent Tony Thurmond,
Please make the ESMC genuinely INCLUSIVE by making all California students equally important by removing the "Four Foundational Disciplines" categorizing which PRIVILEGES certain students and MARGINALIZES the rest - see the ESMC Preface Lines 57 - 61.
Please eliminate the language of Grievance, Oppression, Privilege, Whiteness - all of which encourages students to resent other students who have done nothing to deserve the hatred this encourages.
Please eliminate this language which targets Jewish children - it's bad enough that they face threats from the Nativist Rightists: Sample Lesson 41: Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race
 Page 506 Line 10650 Descendants of Jewish immigrants often assimilated and changed their position on the racial hierarchy from their immigrant parents, gaining racial privilege.
 Line 10959 Light-skinned Jews simultaneously experience white privilege on the basis of their appearance and prejudice, discrimination, and systematic antisemitism on the basis of their Jewishness.
ALL children in California Public Schools deserve better than to be exposed to this incitement to resentment.
Respectfully yours, Margaret Kallman
