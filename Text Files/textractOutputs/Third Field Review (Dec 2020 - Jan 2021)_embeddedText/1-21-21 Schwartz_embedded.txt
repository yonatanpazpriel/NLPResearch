The curriculum you are recommending is divisive and hateful. California is approximately 3 percent Jewish making Jews are a minority. Labeling descendants of Holocaust survivors privileged racist white supremacists is beyond hurtful and disgusting. Jews have always been oppressed. You are promoting hate and division. Why don't you focus on unity and peace?
