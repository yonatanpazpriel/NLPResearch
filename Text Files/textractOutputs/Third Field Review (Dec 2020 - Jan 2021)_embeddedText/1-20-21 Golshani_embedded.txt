From: Mahsa Golshani Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:27 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Jews portrayal in proposed CA curriculum
To Whom it may Concern:
The term privilege should not be used with regards to Jews in CA's proposed curriculum. That would only perpetuate anti-semitism and does not reflect the discrimination and prejudice that Jews have faced throughout history.
Please portray the Jews in a fair manner and do not single them out as the only group to be identified as privileged.
Thank you for your consideration, Lisa Golshani CA resident
