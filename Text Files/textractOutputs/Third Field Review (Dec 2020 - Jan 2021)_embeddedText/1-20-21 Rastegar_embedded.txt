From: JASMINE KAHEN RASTEGAR Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 10:35 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-semitism in ethic studies curriculum
To CDE:
Jews are not privileged. They are a time and time again discriminated against, persecuted and hated. Please reflect the truth in your ethnic studies curriculum. Anything other will be ANTISEMETIC including not including Jews in the ethnic minorities.
Thank you.
Sincerely,
Jasmine Kahen Rastegar, JD
