I hope the curriculum teaches why I; as a proud Caucasian, am sickened by the Cracker Jack brand of popcorn. It triggers me. It makes me want to dye my hair blue, wear a black mask and rally against people that have nothing to do with the brand. Maybe if I contributed money to the teacher's unions this could happen. You people are fucking idiots. Have a great day and go fuck yourselves.
