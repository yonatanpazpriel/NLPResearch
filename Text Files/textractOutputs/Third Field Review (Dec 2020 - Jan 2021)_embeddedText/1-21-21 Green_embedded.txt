From: LISA GREEN Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:56 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Opposed to Critical Race Theory
Hello, I am writing to express my opposition to the teaching of critical race theory. While racist words and actions have occurred throughout history--by all races, and toward all races--it would be a step backward to start focusing on all the bad things that humans have done to each other over the millennia.
Here in the U.S. we certainly had our share of oppression of one group against another. But we have come further than any other nation in correcting it. There is definitely room for improvement. But I think it would be vastly more beneficial to all races to instead focus on all the rightnesses and accomplishments of people. We have laws in place to prevent discrimination.
If, in the schools, the positive accomplishments and cultural aspects of many different groups were taught, it would not only instill a lot of self-worth, but would go far to deter violence and oppression. Even if some school kids have bad influences from their families, they can learn that they can think for themselves and not fall into the bad habits of those that came before them.
You'll have a lot more people that know they can rise above the jerks in society. Focus on the very successful people from all groups who have reaped the benefits the freedoms we have here. They were hard won, and we shouldn't regress into the race baiting.
Thank you for listening.
