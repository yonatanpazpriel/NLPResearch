Do NOT establish your INSANE, CORRUPT leftist, socialist political garbage programs in our public schools-- like "Critical Race Theory!" As Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King correctly said, "We are all only ONE RACE-- the HUMAN RACE!!" Close your insanely corrupt, evil ATHEIST Socialist political books-- and pick up a Bible, instead-- follow the teachings of Christ-- like King and Gandhi, and St. Mother Teresa! Linda Bellavia
