From: Boris Levine Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 11:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Abolish the ESMC program
To whom it may concern:
In this day and age, how can a commission with antisemitic tendencies be allowed to craft any public program? This whole endeavor is a disgrace to California and the entire country. Disband the current commission, abolish the project.
