From: Sang Hea Kil Sent: Tuesday, January 5, 2021 4:32 PM To: Sang Hea Kil Cc: Ethnic Studies; [emails redacted]; Superintendent Subject: [EXTERNAL] SAVE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES
To whom it may concern:
Ethnic Studies is about addressing structural racism, not reproducing it. Our communities need a real Ethnic Studies curriculum defined by experts in the field.
The attack on Arab American Studies and Palestine is an attack on Ethnic Studies. Arab American curriculum belongs in Asian American Studies. All of the experts agree.
Politicians and right-wing political interest groups should not dictate the future of education in California. In addition to the damage to our children, this sets a dire precedent for the rest of the country.
We know, from the demands for racial justice sweeping this county, that it is offensive and dangerous to shunt the histories and perspectives of people of color to the sidelines. These revisions are tone-deaf to the political moment we are living in.
Our children are once again being left to fend for themselves in an increasingly racialized and polarized political climate. California should be a sanctuary, not a place of danger for our students and their families.
Young people in particular face the consequences of Islamophobia and anti-Arab racism. Arab and Muslim youth are simultaneously invisibilized and targeted.
For too long, Arab youth have learned little about their history besides offensive and racist images and stereotypes. Arab-American studies curriculum provides a critical intervention to these stereotypes in K-12 education.
Pro-Israel interest groups should not define antisemitism. Definitions that name criticism of Israel as antisemitic are opposed by many Jewish organizations, both within the United States and internationally. These definitions violate our constitutional right to free speech because their application censors virtually all criticism of Israel and advocacy for Palestinian human rights and equality. These definitions also downplay the main source of antisemitism in the United States, which is white nationalism.
