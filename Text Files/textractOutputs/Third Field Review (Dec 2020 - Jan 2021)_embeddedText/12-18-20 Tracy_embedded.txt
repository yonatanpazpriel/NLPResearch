From: Tracy Sent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 8:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] OPPOSE THE PROPOSED ESMC
I am a California resident with school age kids. I write to you to voice my opposition for the proposed Ethic Studies Model Curriculum. Please do NOT impose predigested political views on our students with the proposed ESMC.
The proposed ESMC is divisive and encourage victimization, which we do not need in our schools!
