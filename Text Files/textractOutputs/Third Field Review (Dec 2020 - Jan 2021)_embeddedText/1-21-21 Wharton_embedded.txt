From: James Wharton Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 10:26 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Antisemetism is not acceptable
The proposed curriculum furthers hateful rhetoric toward the Jewish population. This is unacceptable and must be remedied. We have no place in our society for this or any other hate / racism. Thank you for taking the time.
