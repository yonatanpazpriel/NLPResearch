If you want majority of "white" people to flee California, teach their children to be ashamed of their skin color! This is ethnic cleansing of California. This is racism and Californians that stay will sue, however the "white" whom are poor (not able to sue) must leave! History will prove that this was seriously harmful for the California educators! What happened in Cupertino will not be tolerated!
