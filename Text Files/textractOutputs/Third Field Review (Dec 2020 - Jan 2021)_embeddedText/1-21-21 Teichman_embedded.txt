I read about your curriculum which labels Jews as privileged. It unfairly paints Jews negatively when it narrates that Jews attempt to hide their religion because of their white skin, and by changing their names to common culture names to go unnoticed. Please use your curriculum to teach the about what makes Jews an honorable people. A nation with steadfast values with a high moral code. A religion which emphasizes love your neighbor as you love yourself. Whose 10 commandments are are noble and just. Please use your curriculum to spread love and acceptance, rather than fuel others with baseless hate. Thank you, Keli Teichman
