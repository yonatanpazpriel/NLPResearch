I am appalled at the news article I read in the Jewish Journal. https://jewishjournal.com/commentary/327667/jews-have-until-thursday-to-influence-ethnic-studiescurriculum/ This can't happen - I want my voice heard I am a proud Jewish woman and loathe the idea that Jewish history is treated with disdain and bigotry. I urge you to do what's right !
