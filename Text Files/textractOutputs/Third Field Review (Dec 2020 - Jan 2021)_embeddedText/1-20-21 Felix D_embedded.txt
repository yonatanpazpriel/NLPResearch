Dear Sir/Madam,
As a Jew who has been told randomly, on many occasions, by strangers, that I "look Jewish" - at restaurants, on college campus, a coffee shop, and social gatherings - I am shocked that Jews are targeted as "privileged" or "white" in any education curriculum. Sometimes I've been asked if I'm Armenian, Persian, Italian or Latino, but most often "Jewish", "them boys" and, once, a "Heeb". I had a stranger tell me that he was "cheap as a Jew", and a woman once followed me from a fast food chain yelling that "Jews always stick your noses" because I asked her to stop harassing a fast food employee. Once I've been told that I should go "back to your country".
If you are considering any ethnic studies curriculum that associates the word "privilege" with Jews or with light colored skin, you are ignoring actual Jewish experience, misrepresenting our ancestry and ethnicity, and ignoring that no matter what skin color your proposed curriculum will teach students who are not Jewish (the vast majority of American students), Jews are always targeted and identified as "Jews". I am not "white" because the real world doesn't see me as "White". Jews are "white" only when it fits an agenda, an agenda that changes according to the speaker.
I urge you to pass a curriculum that actually represents Jews' experience, and not one imposed on Jews by an outside bias.
Thank you.
Felix
