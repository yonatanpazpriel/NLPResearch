From: Masha Melnik Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 12:20 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Regarding New Curriculum Proposal
To Whom it may concern,
I am a concerned parent. I am writing to you as a Jewish parent I am appalled and outraged that the idea of "passing" and "privilege" would be used in reference to my heritage. I come from hardship and my family has see discrimination throughout many generations to now have my children be educated that they are "privledged" is a disgusting sentiment that I cannot tolerate. During such divided times, would the Department of education even conceive such a curriculum, causing a further divide amongst our citizens. It is a time of unity.
I plea and encourage you to do the right thing and remove any such verbiage from any and all proposed curriculum.
Thank you for your time.
Best Regards,
Maria
