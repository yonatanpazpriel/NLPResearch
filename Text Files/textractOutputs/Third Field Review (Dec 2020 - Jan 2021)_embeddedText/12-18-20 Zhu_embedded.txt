From: Michael Zhu Sent: Friday, December 18, 2020 12:57 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] I am AGAINST your proposed curriculum.
Dear Sir or Madam,
I am strongly against your proposed curriculum.
I came to the United States to escape communism, socialism, oppression and discrimination. America was a symbol of equality and freedom. We are proud to come to this melting pot to become one people.
Your proposed curriculum promotes racial division & hatred. You want to promote preferential treatment of certain races. You are teaching kids to hate America. You are trying to prevent us from becoming one people. You are working against Dr. Martin Luther King's ideal. SHAME ON YOU!
You are trying to destroy our kids and destroy our nation. Please stop this bullshit.
Sincerely,
Yu Zhu
