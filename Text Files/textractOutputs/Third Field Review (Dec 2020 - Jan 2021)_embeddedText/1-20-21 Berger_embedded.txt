From: Jason Berger Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 9:06 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] proposed curriculum
Given the insurrection on capitol hill on January 6th of this year, led and supported in part by Neo-nazis and white supremacists, and given the rise in antisemitism across the U.S., including but not limited to the murders in in Pittsburgh, Monsey, and Jersey City, CA Ethnic studies needs to do a much better job in listening to input from Jews, rather than listening to input from anti-Semites on the far right and far left. Sadly, the current proposed curricula treats Jews as privileged, reminiscent of how Jews were taught about in Nazi Germany.
Honestly, do better. Or at least, don't be Nazis.
