From: Tony Moon Sent: Sunday, January 17, 2021 7:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Critical Race Theory
Hello,
I recently received notification and news that Critical Race Theory will be included in the California curriculum. Why is this being included when it's a theory at best? As an American Asian, you are discriminating and setting up future generations to judge and be judged based on the color of their skin instead of who they are or as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. cited, the content of their character. The continuation of this will lead to class action lawsuits which I am sure will not only bring civil judgement but criminal as well.
Sincerely,
