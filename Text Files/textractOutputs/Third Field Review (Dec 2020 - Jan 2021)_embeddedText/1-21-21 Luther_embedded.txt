Dear madam or sir,
According to an article in the California Family Counsel News by Greg Burt "President Donald Trump has ignited a national debate about Critical Race Theory (CRT), after he recently banned his federal agencies and federal contractors from teaching this ideology as part of employee diversity training. Trump called CRT a "malign ideology" that "threatens to infect core institutions of our country" because it teaches, among other things, "that men and members of certain races, as well as our most venerable institutions, are inherently sexist and racist."
I am in complete agreement and stand highly opposed to the critical race theory curriculum being taught or mandated at our public schools as it truly appears to be based on an unproven narrative of systemic racism to divide people into oppressors and victims based on skin color.
It is my sound opinion that there far too many biases as well as inaccurate information already being taught which has only led to the increased division within the United States of America. This curriculum only creates a greater divide.
Any agenda / indoctrination that seeks to divide this nation of PEOPLE is unacceptable and when you force our teachers to use this curriculum, you not only promote divisiveness, through grouping people based on race, you are mandating it and this is absolutely not acceptable.
I implore you to reject this curriculum.
Regards,
Barbara Luther
