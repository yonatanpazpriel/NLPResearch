From: Erik Simon Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 3:59 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Proposed Ethnic Studies Curriculum - Concept of "Privilege"
By referring to Jews as a "privileged" group, the proposed ethnic studies curriculum defines a single religious community not by its own religious teachings or by its undisputed historical experiences but by a highly questionable and hostile stereotype that has no place in public school curriculum that may influence millions of impressionable minds.
Not only is it totally inappropriate to teach students to view a single religious community in such a simplistic, ahistorical and negative view, but the concept of "privilege" should have no place in an ethnic studies curriculum.
America and the world contain a range of cultures which offer a deep reservoir of beauty and wisdom. An ethnic studies curriculum, if it must be done, should expose students to the world's beautiful cultural and ethnic diversity without defining any one group as being "privileged," a concept that teaches resentment in place of enlightenment and transforms California's curriculum into an instrument of marginalization and prejudice.
