Dear Sir/Madam,
As a retired professor of Intercultural Studies, I am very concerned about the curriculum that you are developing and proposing. Having taught Intercultural Studies with students from over 60 different countries for more than 20 years, it is my hope that you have been truly truthful. Unfortunately, so many today are not interested in true and accurate education, but only on passing a particular narrative on to students. Objectivity, research, and actual historical facts are of prime importance. It is my hope that you have included in your curriculum accurate histories, including those of Martin Luther King, Jr., Rosa Parks and others. These were courageous leaders who paved the way in difficult circumstances. Please provide a full and complete history. Show the wrongs that have been righted, the injustices that have been rectified. Unlike the media, it is my hope that they both the good and bad will be shown. If not, you will not have a curriculum but a mere narrative that is not entirely true, maybe even false or deceptive.
Although racial equality, for instance, has a ways to go in the USA, I do believe that the USA is far ahead of the world that we live in. I have experienced another side of the world for much of my life. Having worked and taught in Europe for more than 30 years, I saw many of the racial problems that my friends and students (mainly Africans) experienced in Europe. The fact that there has been tremendous racial progress in the USA needs to applauded.
Kindly, Cecil Stalnaker Professor Emeritus Intercultural Studies Valencia, California
