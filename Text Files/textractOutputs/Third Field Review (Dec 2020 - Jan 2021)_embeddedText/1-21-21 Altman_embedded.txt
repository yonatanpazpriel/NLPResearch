From: Cheryl Altman Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 5:41 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Vote no for new curriculum on ethnic studies targeting Jewish people
Please do not support the recommendation for a new curriculum on Jewish peoples. This new curriculum is being sponsored by those who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire); it uses racial distinctions to divide people into those who are considered white (and therefore privileged) and those who are non-white (and therefore oppressed); and in the case of Jews, it combines the two, pitting "Jews of color" against Jews who are tarred with "conditional whiteness" and its attendant "racial privilege."
This is a terrible curriculum which will create discrimination, racism and hatred.
