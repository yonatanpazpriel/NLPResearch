I support the ADL ideals to teach tolerance and understanding of the history of our Jewish brothers and sisters. Hate must collide with the wall of knowledge.
I support the 1619 Project's effort to teach true American history that includes the horrors of slavery and aftermath of Jim Crow and denial of inequality. Systemic racism is real. Truth and Reconciliation is the only pathway to peace and justice in the United States.
Thank you for your time and consideration, Saundra Aslanian Citizen
