From: Susan Prudler Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 12:32 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Critical Race Theory - do not approve!
Dear Board of Education members,
Please do NOT approve the curriculum of Critical Race Theory in our K-12 schools in California. This theory does not present a fair and balanced study of race and ethnicity in America, but leans heavily toward leftist ideology, ignoring any conservative viewpoints. It is your responsibility to present non-partisan and fair curriculum to our students. Critical Race Theory is anything but fair.
Thank you.
Susan Prudler
