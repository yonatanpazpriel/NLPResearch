To whom it may concern,
Can you please not include CRT in K-12 learning. We need our children to really understand reading, writing and math. Especially with attention to comprehension. I cannot stress this enough.
Computer skills, learning how to balance a checkbook, trade skills. Children need to be prepared to go out into life. I don't believe CRT will help along these lines.
