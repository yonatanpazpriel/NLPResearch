Dear Members of the CA State Board of Education, SBE President Linda Darling-Hammond, Governor Gavin Newsom, and State Superintendent Tony Thurmond:
As educators, we support ethnic studies courses that confront racism, develop civic responsibility, and help s tudents build the 21st century skills that they need to succeed in school, work, and life.
More than 1,000 educators, parents, and community members have submitted public comments asking you to remove all critical race theory pedagogy, references, and race-based pejoratives from the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC).
Woven throughout the ESMC a re at least 90 direct and indirect references to "critical race theory," which the ESMC states is a key theoretical framework and pedagogy for ethnic studies instruction (ESMC Chapter 3).
Critical race theory is n ot sound K-12 classroom pedagogy. Critical race theory t eaches that students need to adopt a group identity based on their race, and then assigns a judgment or stereotype about the student based on that racial identity. This is discrimination.
Critical race theory also teaches that one race-based group is the oppressor of the other group, creating an oppositional relationship that leads to resentment and bullying. The ESMC is quite clear about this: learning about topics like "oppression" can make "traumas arise" and cause students to feel "vulnerability, uneasiness, sadness, guilt, helplessness, or discomfort" (ESMC Chapter 3, Lines 154-155, 283-285) The ESMC advises educators to embrace that by being attentive to "trauma informed" educational practices and having "school site counselors" available for further support when teaching ethnic studies (ESMC Chapter 3, Lines 156-157, 400-401).

It does not surprise us that lawsuits have been filed by families whose children have been harmed when critical race theory entered their schools. One such lawsuit was filed in December 2020 regarding critical race theory education in high school i n Las Vegas, NV. This lawsuit asserts violations of a bi-racial student's constitutional rights under the 1st, 5th, and 14th amendments. In this case, cr itical race theory informed practices had teachers instructing students about which peers were oppressors and coercing them to affirm politicized and discriminatory views they did not hold.
The inclusion of critical race theory in the ESMC goes against California State Board of Education's obligation to not adopt instructional materials "that contain any matter reflecting adversely upon persons on the basis of race." (CA Education Code Section 51501). It also goes against our obligation as California teachers to "impress upon the minds of the pupils ...the promotion of harmonious relations" and not promote "discriminatory bias on the basis of race" in our classrooms. (C A Education Code Sections 233.5(a) and 51500).
As Stanford University Graduate School of Education Professor and Ethnic Studies researcher Thomas Dee states, "high quality ethnic studies model curricula...stress the considerable cultural assets and capacity of historically marginalized people to achieve well."
On behalf of CA educators and students, we appreciate your attention to this very important issue. Please see b elow for our detailed comments.

 Throughout these comments and requested revisions, b old text indicates additions and strikethrough indicates deletions.
Critical Race Theory Critical race theory is the theory that race "i s a socially constructed concept that is used by white people to further their economic and political interests at the expense of people of colour [and that] racial inequality emerges from the social, economic, and legal differences that white people create between "races" to maintain elite white interests...giving rise to poverty and criminality in many minority communities."1 Ou r Request We ask that all references to critical race theory, direct and indirect, be removed from the ESMC.

There are multiple definitions of race....In Ethnic Studies, 'race' is a (neo)colonial social construction. It is viewed as a 'master category' based upon a Eurocentric biological fallacy that is central to inequitable power relations is society. As a social and historical construct, the idea of race is primarily filtered through physical traits (phenotype), including pigmentation (skin color) and other physical features; where people's ancestral origins are from (pre colonial geographic ancestry); cultural traits; and sometimes economic class. Since race produces material impacts, it also produces racial consciousness and facilitates the process of racialization and racial projects, including both the oppositional projects of racism/colorism/anti-Blackness/anti-Indigen eity and anti-racism/racial justice. The People of Color Power movements that emerged in the 1960s (Black Power, red Power, Brown Power, Yellow Power) are key examples of how race has also been embraced and leveraged in the resistance against racism; they are the movements that Ethnic Studies rose from. In the United States today, races very broadly break down as people of color (POC) and white people." - page 68. APA: Cuauhtin, R. T., Zavala, M, Sleeter, C. and Au, W.

Revise as follows:
There are multiple definitions of race. O ne is that race is the idea that the human species is divided into distinct groups on the basis of inherited physical and behavioral differences. Genetic studies in the late 20th century refuted the existence of biogenetically distinct races, and scholars now argue that "races'' are cultural interventions [inventions] reflecting specific attitudes and beliefs that were imposed on different populations in the wake of western European conquests beginning in the 15th century.

a. This claim was first made by Omi and Winant in their book "Racial Formation" (3rd edition), not Tolteka Cuauhtin who asserts it in his book without attribution.
b. Omi and Winant acknowledge that this claim parts with "both mainstream social science and left political theorizing about race." (page vii)
c. It is based on Omi and Winant's new view that race is the primary lens to be used to explain what happens in our country, a critical race theory framing:
"We advance what may seem an audacious claim. We assert that in the United States, race is a master category -- a fundamental concept that has profoundly shaped, and continues to shape, the history, polity, economic structure, and culture of the United States." (page 106)
"This is a new claim for us.. ..we are emphasizing its ubiquity: its presence and importance. We are noting that no other social conflict--not class, not sex/gender, not colonialism or imperialism--can ever be understood independently of it." (page viii)

The text leading up to the cited portion, but omitted from the ESMC, ascribes "beliefs and deficits" to "White teachers" (as cited in the original source below) because of their skin color. It is because of this discriminatory assumption that White teachers are told to work through "critical" assignments. This is the definition of discrimination.  C A law prohibits discrimination.
From Allyson Tintiangco-Cubales et al., "Toward an Ethnic Studies Pedagogy: Implications for K�12 Schools from the Research," T he Urban Review 47, no. 1 (March 12, 2015).: "White teachers often try to be colorblind and not see race, creating an imaginary world where neither the concept of race nor racism exists presently or in the past. These beliefs and deficits must be confronted, and doubly so for teachers of Ethnic Studies. Critical autobiography, critical storytelling, and critical life history can help White teachers examine connections between their individual lives and identities, and broader social and political contexts. Rather than assuming that Whites have no experience with race and racism, these activities assist White teachers in analyzing experiences they do have that contribute to their identity, beliefs, and position within the racial hierarchy."

IQC member Kimberly Young's January 2020 article is about challenging the dominant narrative with the 1619 project, which was an initiative of New York Times Magazine. The 1619 project originally asserted that maintaining slavery was the main reason for the American Revolution, not liberty and equality.
In the example lesson included in her article, Young asks students to discuss that "our founding ideals of liberty and equality were false when they were written."
However, the N YT retracted its protecting-slavery-was-primary claim in March 2020, revising it to state that some but not all colonists had this motivation.
Consequently, this source is now incorrect and should be removed, as the original claim promoted critical race theory and is repeated in Young's article.

Comments on Racial Identity and/or White as a Pejorative in the ESMC Draft 3
The following table lists specific references to racial stereotypes in the ESMC Draft 3.
Within the ESMC, the terms "white supremacy" and "white supremacist" are used incorrectly. They are used to connote that all racism and discrimination is perpetrated by white people. This is a violation of Federal and CA law and SBE rules: do not discriminate, demean, stereotype, or divide students.
 A white supremacist is "A person who believes that white people constitute a superior race and should therefore dominate society, typically to the exclusion or detriment of other racial and ethnic groups, in particular black or Jewish people." (OED/Lexico)

Comments on "Institutional Racism" and "Systemic Racism" in the ESMC
The following table lists specific occurrences of "systemic racism," "institutionalized racism," and "institutional racism" in the ESMC Draft 3.
The ESMC does not differentiate between "institutional racism" and "systemic racism." It uses these terms interchangeably, and defines them as "t he systemic normalization or legalization of racism and discrimination. This often emerges via the unequal and inequitable distribution of resources, power, and opportunity. Institutional racism is also referred to as systemic and/or structural racism" (Chapter 3, Line 767, Footnote 13).

Reason
1. Source(s) promote critical race theory.
As one example, in the chapter "Matrix of Social Identity," Cuauhtin provides a classroom handout that, among other things, asserts that "White Supremacy" is a system of oppression with Whites the dominant/privileged group and People of Color the oppressed.
Requirement: d o not discriminate, demean, stereotype, or divide students. (F ederal and California law and State Board of Education approved Standards and Guidelines)
2. Promotes the book co-edited by Tolteka Cuauhtin, a private fee-based Ethnic Studies consultant whom the State Board of Education appointed as co-chair of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee (MCAC). SBE should determine whether its inclusion complies with State conflict of interest rules applicable to its appointees such as members of the State Board of Education and MCAC. For example, the California Political Reform Act bars SBE and MCAC members from participating in matters that "may foreseeably have a material effect on any financial interest."
Cuauhtin did not recuse himself when the MCAC agreed to recommend a model curriculum that cited his book.

1. Source promotes critical race theory.
As an example, Tintiangco-Cubales' paper repeatedly asserts race-based stereotypes about White teachers whose "beliefs and deficits must be confronted." These race-based stereotypes include:
"for White teachers especially, issues of identity involve unpacking the impact of benefiting from racism, as well as learning to recognize themselves as cultural beings"
White teachers "often bring naive optimism that coexists with unexamined stereotypes"
White teachers create ``a hegemonic story about how people of color should be able to pick themselves up by their bootstraps'

2. Does not comply with SBE's ESMC Guidelines which require that this curriculum "include accurate information based on current and confirmed research." This includes:
The findings Tintiangco-Cubales mentions above are based on pre-2016 observations and opinions such as a 2011 findings generalized to White teachers after observing six White teachers in Chicago.
Tintiangco-Cubales' paper contains many similar findings from small, uncontrolled and unverified studies.
Stanford's Dee and Penner -- whose study just received an award and is endorsed in the curriculum --- stated that their 2016 study "is the first study to examine the effect of any type of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in a quantitative study that supports credible causal inferences." (page 24) https://www.nber.org/system/files/working _papers/w21865/w21865.pdf
This indicates that Tintiangco-Cubales' conclusions are based on"findings" that Dee and Penner found deficient. As a result, this paper and content pulled from it should be removed from the ESMC.

For white students, this portion of the lesson might involve considering what kind of white person they might have been in California before 1950. For students of color, Sammy Lee's own admission that he "wished to be white" could become an important occasion to consider their own internalized racism, to reflect upon how racism can "teach" children of color to hate themselves. For all students, Lee's life overall can serve as a reminder that a multiracial American citizenship remains a rather recent development, a mere fraction within the longer arc of American history.

Differentiating class work and assignments between "white students" and "students of color" is racial discrimination.

Comments on Sample Lesson 41: Jewish Americans: Identity, Intersectionality, and Complicating Ideas of Race
The following table lists specific comments related to Sample Lesson 41 in the ESMC Draft 3.
Within the ESMC, the terms "conditional whiteness," "white presenting," and "privilege" are used pejoratively to denote the white/dominant group. The implication is that all white people have "racial privilege" and thus perpetuate racism. This stereotype is in violation of state and SBE rules to not discriminate, demean, stereotype, or divide students.

conditional whiteness - When a person or group can gain racial privilege by dropping ethnic markers of difference or assertions of belonging to a separate group. A person or a

racial formation - Race is socially constructed rather than fixed, biological, or from time immemorial. The structure, or formation, of
racial hierarchies vary in different times and
places. Racial formation theory states that
race is composed of ideas about race and the
social structures of racial stratification in a particular time and place. Racial categories and boundaries can change over time and place,
and a group can become racialized, that is, categorized as a stigmatized group, or be seen as part of a dominant race.[1]
