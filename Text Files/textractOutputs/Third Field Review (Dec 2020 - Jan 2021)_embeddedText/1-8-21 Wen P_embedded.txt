From: Wen P. Sent: Friday, January 8, 2021 4:31 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] object critical race theory and critical social identity
I am writing this email to you because I am strongly objecting the critical race theory and critical social identity because this is a racist curriculum and I do not want it to be taught in our school. Everyone shall not discriminate against, or judged based on race, sex, color ethnicity or national origin.
If you do not want to be divided by any sex, race, color ethnicity or national origin which is treat each idividual as same.
Sincerely Wenny
