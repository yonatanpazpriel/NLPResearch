From: Scott K Sent: Friday, January 15, 2021 12:11 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
I am writing to ask that you please maintain the following items in the latest ESMC draft:
� Lessons on antisemitism, including information about its origins and ongoing threat in the United States � The removal of explicitly antisemitic and anti-Israel content � Safeguards to help prevent hatred and bias in California schools
These improvements to the ESMC are vital and necessary to combat the rise in anti-Jewish attacks across the country.
Thank you for your service,
Scott Kravitz [address redacted] San Francisco, CA
