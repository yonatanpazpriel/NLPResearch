From: Sally Abbott Sent: Saturday, January 16, 2021 10:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Restoring Arab Studies to the Ethnic Studies curriculum
Please restore Arab Studies to its rightful place in Asian Studies in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. These studies are more vitally relevant than ever in the face of decades long defamation of Islam and Arabs under the guise of the so-called war on terror.
It is important that the true history of the Middle East and the West's historical treatment (or mistreatment) of it be told and revealed to students, Arab and non-Arab alike. That way there is a hope of not just overcoming prejudice and disadvantage, but of crafting a foreign policy that is fair and not just revamped neo-colonialism.
Given the lopsided history of American support of Israel, it is vital that Palestinian history be told and honored in the hopes of creating justice for Palestinians and crafting a U.S. foreign policy that honors their rights. Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel was adamant that criticism of Israel and its policies did not constitute anti-Semitism and was totally distinct from it. Let's not participate in the erasure of these people's history and their legitimate claims.
As someone who has taught minority studies (Women's Studies) in the Cal State University system myself, I urge you to include Arab Studies. To fail to do so, is to participate in an erasure campaign, prejudice, and prolong a foreign policy that is widely considered the biggest foreign blunder in our nation's history.
Sincerely, Sally Abbott
