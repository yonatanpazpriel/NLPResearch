12. At all times material hereto, Plaintiff was a student attending Santa Barbara High School

8 within the SBUSD.

9

13. At all times material here to, Plaintiff was a student that lives within the school district

10 operated by SBUSD.

11

14. Upon information and belief, SBUSD hired HARMACHIS as a teacher to work at Santa

12 Barbara High School, and appointed him as a teacher for classes, including history, government,

13 and/or economics. It is through that position with SBUSD that he came to interact with Plaintiff

14 JANE OB DOE.

15

15. Upon information and belief, HARMACHIS was supervised by, among others, SBUSD

16 Superintendent Cary Matsuoka, SBUSD Assistant Superintendent Dr. Frann Wageneck, Santa

17 Barbara High School Principal Alicia Saballa-Santana, Santa Barbara High School Interim

18 Principal Michael Gonzalez, and other Administrators.

24 well-being of students of Santa Barbara High School and other children, including Plaintiff JANE

25 OB DOE.

26

17. On information and belief, HARMACHIS has an extensive history of disciplinary issues

1 a student. During the investigation into this incident, it was discovered that HARMACHIS had 2 made several inappropriate sexual comments to various female students during the 2003-2004 3 school year. Thereafter, in or around 2005, SBUSD gave HARMACHIS a notice of 4 unprofessional conduct and unsatisfactory performance. Rather than terminating HARMACHIS, 5 SBUSD transferred HARMACHIS to Santa Barbara High School. In or around January 2005, 6 HARMACHIS again was disciplined for threatening a student and making inappropriate sexual 7 comments to numerous female students. On information and belief, it was at this time that SBUSD 8 was made aware that HARMACHIS was sexually grooming and abusing female students. In fact, 9 former SBUSD Superintendent, Brian Sarvis

10

11

18. Specifically, on information and belief, by and through its investigation of

12 HARMACHIS, SBUSD knew or reasonably should have known that HARMACHIS was:

13

a.

Making sexually explicit and/or inappropriate comments to female students;

14

b.

Touching female students inappropriately;

15

c.

Hugging female students;

d.

Informing male students of what HARMACHIS could do with the female

17

18

e.

Openly encouraging female students to not wear bras to school;

19

19. In or around April 2005, SBUSD initiated proceedings seeking to dismiss HARMACHIS.

20 Although SBUSD reportedly spent nearly $1 million in the case against HARMACHIS,

21 ultimately, the Commission on Professional Competence determined that dismissal of

22 HARMACHIS was not warranted and HARMACHIS was reinstated at Santa Barbara High

23 School.

24

20. On information and belief, long before the sexual assault of Plaintiff, SBUSD knew or

25 reasonably should have known that HARMACHIS presented a danger to students and needed to

26 be removed from the classroom; however, SBUSD Administrators chose to ignore their legal,

27 ethical, and moral obligation to protect Plaintiff and other vulnerable students. Having already

28 spent nearly $1 million in an effort to dismiss HARMACHIS, SBUSD was no longer willing to

1 expend time or resources dealing with HARMACHIS. Accordingly, rather than segregating

2 HARMACHIS away from students, placing him in an administrative position, or placing

3 HARMACHIS under supervision, SBUSD permitted HARMACHIS to remain in the classroom

4 with students, wholly unsupervised. On information and belief, throughout his continued tenure at

5 Santa Barbara High School, SBUSD ignored continued reports of misconduct and predatory

6 behavior by HARMACHIS.

7

21. Through his positions with Santa Barbara High School and the SBUSD, HARMACHIS

8 was put into direct contact with Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, a student at Santa Barbara High School.

9 HARMACHIS was assigned to teach, mentor, and advise Plaintiff JANE OB DOE. It is under

10 these circumstances that Plaintiff came to be under the direction and control of HARMACHIS,

11 who used his position of authority and trust over Plaintiff JANE OB DOE to sexually abuse and

12 harass her.

13

22. On or around March 8, 2020, following the sexual assault and harassment of Plaintiff,

14

15

23. At no point prior to the date of his arrest, did SBUSD, the Board of Education, and/or the

16 Superintendent undertake to:

17

a. Report HARMACHIS to Child Protective Services, as per the law;

18

b. Report HARMACHIS to law enforcement, as per the law;

19

c. Protect students from

20

24. Instead of reporting, removing, or ceas

21 actions effectively emboldened HARMACHIS to engage in continued sexually inappropriate and

22 predatory behavior with female students.

25. Upon information and belief, SBUSD investigated HARMACHIS for sexual misconduct,

24

25 classroom around minors, providing him with the means and opportunity to sexually abuse,

26 assault, and harass female students, including the Plaintiff, on an ongoing basis.

1

26. HARMACHIS did sexually harass, molest, and abuse Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, who was

2

3 performed on Plaintiff without her free consent, as Plaintiff JANE OB DOE was a minor and thus

4 unable to give valid, legal consent to such sexual acts. These actions upon Plaintiff JANE OB

5 DOE constituted conduct that is believed to be in violation of California Penal Code �� 288(b)(1),

6 647.6(a)(1), and potentially other provisions. HARMACHIS has been placed on administrative

7 leave and has been formally charged with the crimes that he committed against Plaintiff JANE OB

8 DOE.

27. As a student at Santa Barbara High School and the SBUSD, where HARMACHIS was

10 employed and worked, Plaintiff JANE OB DOE

11 care and control, thus creating a special relationship, fiduciary relationship, and/or special care

12 relationship with Defendants, and each of them. Additionally, as a minor child under the custody,

13 care and control of Defendants SBUSD, Defendant SBUSD stood in loco parentis with respect to

14 Plaintiff JANE OB DOE while she was attending school and school-related functions at Santa

15 Barbara High School and the SBUSD. As the responsible parties and/or employers controlling

16 HARMACHIS, Defendant SBUSD was also in a special relationship with Plaintiff, and owed

17 special duties to Plaintiff JANE OB DOE.

18

28. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that Defendant SBUSD, knew

19 or should have known that HARMACHIS had engaged in unlawful sexually-related conduct with

20 minors in the past, and/or was continuing to engage in such conduct with Plaintiff JANE OB

21 DOE. Defendant SBUSD had a duty to disclose to these facts to Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, her

22 parents and others, but negligently and/or intentionally suppressed, concealed or failed to disclose

23 this information. The duty to disclose this information arose by the special, trusting, confidential,

24 fiduciary, and/or in loco parentis relationship between Defendants and Plaintiffs.

29. Defendant SBUSD failed to take reasonable steps and/or implement reasonable safeguards

26 to avoid acts of unlawful sexual conduct by HARMACHIS, including, but not limited to

1 that function or environment. Instead, Defendant SBUSD ignored and/or concealed the sexual

2 harassment and abuse of Plaintiff JANE OB DOE and others by HARMACHIS that had already

3 occurred. Plaintiff JANE OB DOE is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that

4 Defendants and each of them were given notice of incidents of inappropriate conduct by

5 HARMACHIS, including such facts as those set forth in this Complaint.

6

30. Plaintiff is informed and believes, on that basis allege, that prior to and during the sexual

7 harassment and abuse of Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, Defendants knew or should have known that

8 HARMACHIS had violated his role as a teacher, mentor, advisor and faculty member, and used

9 his position of authority and trust acting on behalf of Defendants to gain access to children,

10 including Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, on and off the school facilities and grounds of Santa Barbara

11 High School, in which he engaged in sexual misconduct, harassment and abuse, with such

12 children including Plaintiff JANE OB DOE.

13

31. With actual or constructive knowledge that Defendant HARMACHIS had previously

14 engaged in dangerous and inappropriate conduct, including sexually harassing and abusing other

15 minors at Santa Barbara High School and other minors, Defendants conspired to and did

16 knowingly fail to take reasonable steps, and failed to implement reasonable safeguards to avoid

17 acts of unlawful sexual conduct in the future by HARMACHIS, including, but not limited to,

18 preventing or avoiding placement of HARMACHIS in a function or environment in which contact

1

a. HARMACHIS was at all times relevant to this Complaint a teacher, mentor, and

2

advisor at Santa Barbara High School, an institution wholly operated by SBUSD.

3

b. While HARMACHIS sexually harassed and abused Plaintiff, Defendants were well

4

aware that HARMACHIS took an unusual interest, and spent an inordinate amount of

5

time with Plaintiff.

6

c. Beginning in or around 2016 through 2017, the perpetrator HARMACHIS sexually

13 that basis alleges, that such conduct by Defendant HARMACHIS was based upon Plaintiff's

15 were performed by Defendant HARMACHIS without the free consent of Plaintiff, who was a

16 minor during the abuse period.

19 occurring, and thereafter, but took no action to obstruct, inhibit or stop such continuing conduct,

appearance of propriety, and to avoid investigation and action by public authority including law 2
enforcement. Plaintiff JANE OB DOE is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that 3
such actions were motivated by a desire to protect the reputation of Defendants and each of them, 4
and to protect the monetary support of Defendants while fostering an environment where such 5
abuse could continue to occur. 6
38. Subsequent to his sexual abuse at the hands of HARMACHIS, Plaintiff began to 7
experience multiple mental, emotional and psychological problems, due to the sexual harassment 8
and abuse she suffered at the hands of HARMACHIS, including, but not limited to: Plaintiff 9
JANE OB DOE being angry; Plaintiff JANE OB DOE experiencing frequent anxiety; Plaintiff 10
JANE OB DOE experiencing depression; Plaintiff JANE OB DOE feeling helpless; Plaintiff 11
JANE OB DOE experiencing sleeplessness; and Plaintiff JANE OB DOE having significant trust 12
and control issues. 13
39. As a direct result of the sexual harassment and abuse of Plaintiff JANE OB DOE by 14
HARMACHIS, Plaintiff JANE OB DOE has difficulty in reasonably or meaningfully interacting 15
with others, including those in positions of authority over Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, including 16
supervisors, and in intimate, confidential and familial relationships, due to the trauma of childhood 17
sexual harassment and abuse inflicted upon her by HARMACHIS. This inability to interact creates 18
trust and confidence in others, and has caused 19
Plaintiff JANE OB DOE substantial emotional distress, anxiety, nervousness and fear. As a direct 20
result of Plaintiff's abuse and harassment by HARMACHIS, Plaintiff JANE OB DOE experienced 21
severe issues with her personal life, including issues with trust and difficulties in maintaining 22
meaningful relationships, and difficulty with school. These feelings have caused Plaintiff JANE 23
OB DOE substantial emotional distress, anxiety, nervousness and fear. 24

conduct and/or breaches of their duties, whether 26
employment and personal development has or will be adversely affected. Plaintiff JANE OB 27

procedures applicable to Defendants, including but not limited to the following: 6

* Duty to refrain from taking official action that contradicts the provisions of Article 1, 9

Rights Act, section 1983, and the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution; 12

* Duty to prevent discrimination or sexual harassment and abuse from occurring in 11
public educational facilities (Education Code � 200, et seq.). 12
42. Compulsory education laws create a special relationship between students and 13
Defendants, and students have a constitutional guarantee to a safe, secure and peaceful school 14
environment. Defendants and each of them failed to acknowledge unsafe conditions, and 15
therefore failed to guarantee safe surroundings in an environment in which Plaintiff was not free 16
to leave, specifically including but not limited to allowing HARMACHIS to take children for 17
purposes of sexual activity and allowing HARMACHIS to operate isolated environments, 18
incapable of monitoring from the outside, wherein HARMACHIS sexually harassed and abused 19
Plaintiff and others. 20
43. Defendants and each of them had and have a duty to protect students, including Plaintiff. 21
Defendants were required, and failed, to provide adequate campus and off-site school event 22
supervision, and failed to be properly vigilant in seeing that supervision was sufficient to ensure 23
the safety of Plaintiff and others. 24
44. Defendants and each of them lodged with HARMACHIS the color of authority, by which 25
she was able to influence, direct and abuse Plaintiff JANE OB DOE and others, and to act 26

environment, specifically including training to perceive, report and stop inappropriate conduct by 2

regulations prescribed for schools, and execute reasonable control over students necessary to 5
protect the health and safety of the student and maintain proper and appropriate conditions 6
conducive to learning. 7
47. Defendants and each of them were required to and failed to exercise careful supervision of 8
the moral conditions in their school, and provide supervision before and after school. This duty 9
extended beyond the classroom. 10
48. In subjecting Plaintiff JANE OB DOE to the wrongful treatment herein described, 11
HARMACHIS acted willfully and maliciously with the intent to harm Plaintiff JANE OB DOE, 12
and in conscious disregard of Plaintiff's rights, so as to constitute malice and/or oppression under 13
California Civil Code section 3294. Plaintiff JANE OB DOE is therefore entitled, to the recovery 14

2 50. It is upon information, and therefore belief, that the sexual assault perpetrated upon the
3 Plaintiff as a child (as more fully described supra
4
5 Procedure �340.1(b). Specifically, it is based upon information and therefore belief, that the
6 Defendant SBUSD engaged in conduct to conceal the sexually inappropriate behavior of
7 HARMACHIS and to hide facts from the Plaintiff, which would have apprised the Plaintiff, her
8 family, and those who could have intervened
9 not limited to law enforcement, administrative authorities, and child protective agencies) and
10
11 51. Further, it is upon information, and therefore belief, that the Defendants SBUSD and
12 DOES 1 through 100, were specifically aware, or based on the availability of information to them
13 had reason to know, that HARMACHIS was a sexual threat to children in his presence, including
14 the Plaintiff.
15 52. Despite having this knowledge and prior warning HARMACHIS risk of childhood sexual
16 assault posed to children, Defendant SBUSD and DOES 1 through 100 did nothing to protect the
17 Plaintiff, inform her of the risk that the she was placed at, and further, actively concealed this
18 information from the Plaintiff and her family. Regardless of its knowledge about the danger posed
19 to the Plaintiff (and other minors) by HARMACHIS, Defendant SBUSD and DOES 1 through 100
20 refused to inform the Plaintiff about the danger that HARMACHIS posed to her.

54. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation 1
contained herein above as though fully set forth and brought in this cause of action. 2
55. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges that prior to and after the first 3
station, and abuse of Plaintiff, through the 4
present, Defendants, knew or should have reasonably known that HARMACHIS had or was 5
capable of sexually, and/or sexually abusing Plaintiff or other victims. 6
56. Defendants and each of them had special duties to protect the Plaintiff and the other 7
students within Santa Barbara High School and the SBUSD, when such students were entrusted to 8
welfare and/or physical custody was entrusted to 9
Defendants. Defendants voluntarily accepted the entrusted care of Plaintiff. As such, Defendants 10
owed Plaintiff, a minor child, a special duty of care, in addition to a duty of ordinary care, and 11
owed Plaintiff the higher duty of care that adults dealing with children owe to protect them from 12
harm. The duty to protect and warn arose from the special, trusting, confidential, and/or fiduciary 13
relationship between Defendants and Plaintiff. Plaintiff felt great trust, faith and confidence in 14
Defendants, and in HARMACHIS as her teacher, adviser and mentor. 15
57. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants breached 16
their duties of care to the minor Plaintiff by allowing HARMACHIS to come into contact with the 17
minor Plaintiff and other students, without supervision; by failing to adequately hire, supervise 18
and/or retain HARMACHIS who they permitted and enabled to have access to Plaintiff; by failing 19
to investigate or otherwise confirm or deny such facts about HARMACHIS; by failing to tell or 20
concealing from Plaintiff, her parents, guardians and law enforcement officials that HARMACHIS 21
was or may have been sexually harassing and abusing minors; by failing to tell or concealing from 22
Plaintiff's parents, guardians or law enforcement officials that Plaintiff was or may have been 23
sexually harassed and abused after Defendants knew or should have known that HARMACHIS 24
may have sexually harassed and abused Plaintiff or others, thereby enabling Plaintiff to continue 25
to be endangered and sexually harassed, and abused, and/or creating the circumstance where 26
Plaintiff was less likely to receive medical/mental health care or treatment, thus exacerbating the 27
harm done to Plaintiff; and/or by holding out HARMACHIS to Plaintiff as being in good standing 28

investigate or otherwise confirm or deny such facts, failing to reveal such facts to Plaintiff, the 5
community of the school, students, minors, and law enforcement agencies, placing and continuing 6

community of the school, students, minors, and law enforcement agencies as being in good 9

59. Defendants, and each of them, breached their duty to Plaintiff by, inter alia, failing to 11
adequately monitor and supervise HARMACHIS and/or stopping HARMACHIS from committing 12
wrongful sexual acts with minors, including Plaintiff. This belief is founded on the fact that 13
Plaintiff was informed and believed that the Principal and other faculty members at the Santa 14
Barbara High School and District officials, including SBUSD had suspected the abuse and/or 15
harassment was occurring at the time, and failed to investigate into the matter further despite the 16
knowledge of the impropriety of the acts of HARMACHIS. Based on these facts, Defendants 17

5 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
6 BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY
7 (Plaintiff Against All Defendants and Does 1 through 100)
8 165. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation
9 contained herein above as though fully set forth and brought in this cause of action.
10 166. Defendants, as school teachers, staff, faculty, administrators and/or SBUSD and/or Santa
11 Barbara High School officials were in a fiduciary relationship with Plaintiff, owing her a special
12 duty of due care. All Defendants (by and through their agents) are mandated reporters with respect
13 to claims of child abuse and child safety.
14 167. Moreover, Defendants owed the Plaintiff a statutory, common law and constitutional duty
15 to protect her and guarantee her safety at school.
16 168. Defendants breached their fiduciary duty by failing to properly supervise HARMACHIS
17 and take appropriate steps to prevent the lewd and lascivious conduct perpetrated by
18 HARMACHIS against the Plaintiff. Defendants also failed to report HARMACHIS pursuant to
19
20 169. As a result of the above-described conduct, Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer great
21 pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional distress,

23 suffered and continues to suffer and were prevented and will continue to be prevented from

HARMACHIS acted willfully and maliciously with the intent to harm Plaintiff, and in conscious 1
disregard of Plaintiff's rights, so as to constitute malice and oppression under California Civil 2
Code �3294. The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to the recovery of punitive damages, in an amount 3
to be determined by the court, against HARMACHIS, in a sum to be shown according to proof. 4
TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 5
CONSTRUCTIVE FRAUD: (C.C. � 1573) 6
(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants and Does 1 through 100) 7
171. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation 8
contained herein above as though fully set forth and brought in this cause of action. 9
172. By holding themselves out as qualified institutions of learning for children, by holding 10
HARMACHIS out as an agent of Defendants, and by allowing undertaking the academic, 11
psychological and emotional instruction and guidance of the minor Plaintiff through the actions of 12
HARMACHIS, Defendants entered into a fiduciary, special and confidential relationship with 13
Plaintiff. 14
173. Defendants breached their fiduciary, special and confidential duties to the Plaintiff by the 15
wrongful and negligent conduct described herein above, and by so doing gained an advantage over 16
the Plaintiff in matters relating to their safety, security and health. In breaching such duties, 17
Defendants were able to sustain their status as institutions of high moral repute, preserve their 18
reputation in the community, including their administrators and staff, all at the expense of 19
Plaintiff's further injury and in violation of Defendants' mandatory duties. 20
174. By virtue of their fiduciary relationship and special relationship with Plaintiff, 21
Defendants owed the Plaintiff a duty to: 22
a. Investigate or otherwise confirm or deny such claims of sexual abuse; 23
b. Reveal such facts to the Plaintiff, her parents, and caretakers, the school community, 24
and law enforcement agencies; 25
c. Refuse to place HARMACHIS and other molesters in positions of trust and authority 26
within Defendants' institutions; 27

and law enforcement agencies as being in good standing and, trustworthy in keeping 1
with his and their position as a teacher, counselor, advisor, mentor and authority 2
figure; 3
e. Refuse to assign HARMACHIS to positions of power within the school and over 4
minor students; and 5
f. Disclose to the Plaintiff and her parents, the public, the community, the school, 6
students, minors, and law enforcement agencies the wrongful, tortious, and criminal 7
acts of HARMACHIS. 8
175. Defendants' breached their respective duties by: 9
a. Making no or inadequate investigations of HARMACHIS; 10
b. Issuing no warnings about HARMACHIS; 11
c. Permitting HARMACHIS to routinely be alone and in control of minors, 12
unsupervised; 13
d. Not having adopted a policy to prevent HARMACHIS from routinely having minors 14
and minor students in their unsupervised control; 15
16 conduct prior to and during his employment at Defendants; and
17 f. Assigning and continuing to assign HARMACHIS to duties which placed him in
18 positions of authority and trust over minors, positions in which HARMACHIS could
19 easily isolate and sexually abuse minors.
20 176. At the time that Defendants engaged in such suppression and concealment of acts, such
21 acts were done for the purpose of causing the Plaintiff to forbear on their rights.
22 177. Defendants' misconduct did reasonably cause Plaintiff to forbear on her rights.
23 178. The misrepresentation, suppression and concealment of facts were likely to mislead the
24 Plaintiff and others to believe that Defendants had no knowledge of any charges, or that there
25 were no other charges of unlawful and sexual misconduct against HARMACHIS or others and
26 that there was no need for them to take further action or precaution.

179. The misrepresentation, suppression and concealment of facts by Defendants was likely to 1
mislead the Plaintiff and others to believe that Defendants had no knowledge of the fact that 2
HARMACHIS was a danger to students. 3
180. Defendants knew or should have known at the time they suppressed and concealed the 4
true facts regarding HARMACHIS and others' dangerous and inappropriate conduct that the 5
resulting impressions were misleading. 6
181. Defendants suppressed and concealed the true facts with the purpose of: preventing 7
Plaintiff and others from learning that HARMACHIS and others had been engaging in dangerous 8
and inappropriate conduct and were continuing to sexually harass, molest and abuse minors and 9
l, direction, and guidance, with complete 10
impunity; inducing people, including the Plaintiff and other benefactors and donors to participate 11
and financially support Defendants' school and other enterprises of Defendants; preventing further 12
13 damage to the reputations of Defendants;
14 protecting Defendants' power and status in the community and the academic community; avoiding
15
16 criminal liability of Defendants, of HARMACHIS, and of others.
17 182. Defendants, with knowledge of the tortious nature of their own and each others' conduct,
18 gave each other substantial assistance to perpetrate the misrepresentations, fraud and deceit
19 alleged herein.
20 facts, and in reliance thereon, were induced
21 to act or induced not to act, exactly as intended by Defendants. Had Plaintiff and her parents or
22 others known the true facts, they would have not participated further nor continued to financially

24 proper authorities, to other students and their parents so as to prevent future recurrences; they
25 would not have allowed children, including the Plaintiff, to be alone with, or have any relationship

27 under the control of Defendants; they would have undertaken her own investigations which would

have led to discovery of the true facts; and they would have sought psychological counseling for 1
the Plaintiff, and for other children molested and abused by HARMACHIS. 2
184. By giving HARMACHIS the position of teacher, counselor, advisor and mentor, 3
Defendants impliedly represented that HARMACHIS was safe and morally fit to give children 4
instruction, direction and guidance. 5
185. When Defendants made these representations or non-disclosure of material facts, 6
Defendants knew or should have known that the facts were otherwise. Defendants knowingly and 7
intentionally suppressed the material facts that HARMACHIS had engaged in dangerous and 8
inappropriate conduct, and knew of or learned of conduct, or should have learned of conduct by 9
HARMACHIS which placed Defendants on notice that HARMACHIS was likely abusing 10
children. 11
186. Because of the Plaintiff's young age, her mental incapacity, and because of the status of 12
HARMACHIS as an authority figure to the Plaintiff, Plaintiff was vulnerable to HARMACHIS. 13
HARMACHIS sought the Plaintiff out, and was empowered by and accepted Plaintiff's 14
vulnerability. Plaintiff's vulnerability also prevented the Plaintiff from effectively protecting 15
herself from the sexual advances of HARMACHIS. 16
187. Defendants had the duty to obtain and disclose information relating to misconduct of 17
HARMACHIS. 18
188. Defendants misrepresented, concealed or failed to disclose information relating to 19
misconduct of HARMACHIS. 20
189. Defendants knew that they had misrepresented, concealed or failed to disclose 21
information related to misconduct of HARMACHIS. 22
190. Plaintiff justifiably relied upon Defendants for information relating to misconduct of 23
HARMACHIS. 24
191. Defendants, in concert with each other and with the intent to conceal and defraud, 25
conspired and came to a meeting of the minds whereby they would misrepresent, conceal or fail to 26
disclose information relating to the misconduct of HARMACHIS, the inability of Defendants to 27
supervise or stop HARMACHIS from sexually harassing, molesting and abusing the Plaintiff, and 28

their own failure to properly investigate, supervise and monitor his conduct with minors and 1
students. 2
192. By so concealing, Defendants committed at least one act in furtherance of the conspiracy. 3
193. As a result of the above-described conduct, Plaintiff has suffered and continues to suffer 4
great pain of mind and body, shock, emotional distress, physical manifestations of emotional 5
distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, disgrace, humiliation, and loss of enjoyment of life; 6

performing daily activities and obtaining the full enjoyment of life; will sustain loss of earnings 8
and earning capacity, and has incurred and will continue to incur expenses for medical and 9
psychological treatment, therapy, and counseling. 10
194. In addition, when Plaintiff finally discovered the fraud of Defendants, and continuing 11
thereafter, Plaintiff experienced recurrences of the above-described injuries. In addition, when the 12
Plaintiff finally discovered the fraud of Defendants, and continuing thereafter, the Plaintiff 13
experienced extreme and severe mental anguish and emotional distress that the Plaintiff had been 14
the victim of Defendants' fraud; that Plaintiff had not been able to help other minors being 15
molested because of the fraud, and that the Plaintiff had not been able because of the fraud to 16
receive timely medical treatment needed to deal with the problems. The Plaintiff JANE OB DOE 17
had suffered and continues to suffer as a result of the sexual harassment, molestation and abuse. 18
195. As a result of the above-described conduct, the Plaintiff suffered and continues to suffer 19

distress, embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, disgrace, humiliation, and loss of enjoyment of life; 21
has suffered ad continues to suffer and were prevented and will continue to be prevented from 22
