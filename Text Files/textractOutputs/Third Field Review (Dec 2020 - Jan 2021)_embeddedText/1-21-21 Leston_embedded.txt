As the son of Holocaust survivors, who also served the US Army in prosecuting those who tried to wipe Jews from the face of the earth, I would implore you to remove any references to Jew being privileged. The privilege is being allowed to live free in the United States. That is still denied to many Jews, and to other minorities. Some Jews have flourished because of hard work, certainly not from a noblesse oblige in the United States. There is still significant anti-Semitism in this country. Please to not propagate it with stereotyping that engenders hate.
