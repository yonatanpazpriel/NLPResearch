Committee: As an educator in California for close to thirty years I have some definite concerns regarding some of the proposals presented. To begin with, I think it is advantageous to include the stories and voices of what are being called "marginalized populations", which is as it should be. But to me it creates situations where students are being taught that the white population is somehow "bad", and to feel guilty for being white. To me the book, "White Fragility" is an example of that. Rather than elevate contributions by other groups and other voices as part of a whole, it seems to me that the curriculum creates a `us versus them' atmosphere, creating a so called critical race theory or systemic racism, grouping people by their race, and not by what each contributes to society. This builds resentment against the socalled dominate group and to me, creates more racial divide. Isn't this creating oppressors and the oppressed? Isn't dividing people into groups by race divisive enough, which teachs students to resent others. Why not use all these voices to build one community, showing how each contributes to the whole? I taught US History for years and tried to teach history that was not revisionist, or that eliminated the good, the bad and the ugly. The ugly treatment of Native Americans, or the Japanese, or the issue of slavery, or the period of imperialism, teaching that you can't put 21st century morality on a 15th century would . In reality you can't change history but only learn from it, or you are doomed to repeat it. Thank you for a response to my concerns. Linda Caruso
