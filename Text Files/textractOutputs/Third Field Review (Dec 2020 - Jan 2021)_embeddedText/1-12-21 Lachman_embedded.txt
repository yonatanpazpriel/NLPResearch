From: Andrew Lachman Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 7:00 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comments in support of ESC
On behalf of Democrats for Israel California, we write in support of the Ethinc Studies Curriculum as proposed in the last meeting. Ensuring that the diverse American experience, its challenges, successes and failures are taught in our schools is important, as is ensuring that the core four groups are included.
We applaud the efforts of the Superintendent and the commission in balancing diverse and sometimes conflicting narratives by including a variety of previously excluded groups such as Indian-Americans, Korean-Americans, Armenian Americans and Jewish Americans. As the bridge between the Jewish community and the Democratic Party, we particularly appreciate the inclusion of Anti-Semitism studies and exclusion of one-sided narratives on the Middle East, a region with complex and often overlapping stories of triumph and tragedy. We support the ESC as it now.
If there are improvements to be made, improvements would including the adoption of the JIMENA recommendations on inclusion of Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews and adopting the IHRA definition of Antisemtism, adopted by multiple school districts, colleges and government around the world and which we believe gives ample space for free-speech criticism of the conduct of the Israel government and some leaders who have acted outside of the norms of a democratic nation, but at the same time respects the Jewish experience and intertwining of identity with Israel's roots in self-determination for the Jewish people.
Thank you for your time and hard work as well as for considering our input throughout this sensitive period.
Andrew Lachman President Democrats for Israel, California.
