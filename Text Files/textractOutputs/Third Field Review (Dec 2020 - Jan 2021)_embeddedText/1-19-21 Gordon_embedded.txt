Hi,
As the father of mixed culture (Christian / Jewish) with a son of mixed ethnicity (Caucasian / chinese) in very concerned about the proposals for ethnic studies.
What I see with the proposals is a focusing not on difference in terms of positive contributions and a critical analysis of history within its proper context but instead on a focus on an oppressor/victim way of thinking.
The current proposals are incredibly divisive, firstly they entrench guilt and hatred but secondly they also put minorities fighting against each other. Is the evil of slavery of Africans more important than the evil of anti semitism or anti asian racism.
Also, this approach to history ignores the reality of what has happened if the context of the reality that the evils were perpetrated by a tiny minority of rich businessmen and royal families and not by the wider population.
We should of course be critical of what happened be it slavery and invasion practiced by the Europeans and Americans or by the Romans. We should also understand the context of the slow forming of nations of the competition and exploration between different royal households.
We are in danger of doing the wrong thing for the right reasons, trying to make amends for one evil whilst fueling white supremacy by giving them a recruiting ground in port white neighborhoods, and of creating new victims by excluding my son as a half asian from opportunities.
We are in danger of using education to force a political argument of equal opportunity vs equal outcome.
School should be a positive experience. It should not be be teaching students that they should feel guilty for who they are fir the color of their skin for the shape of their nose (as I'm half Jewish). School should teach children to respect difference and seek to understand not to divide or blame.
