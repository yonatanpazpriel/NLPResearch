This is a racist curriculum, I do not want it to be taught in our high school. Who promote such crazy idea should be fined or imprisoned for attempting to mentally poison our kids current in UC and Fremont unified schools.
I reserve the right to jointly file a class action law suit with hundreds of other parents who are the victims against these notorious far left racists and political extremists in CA who abuse the power and pollute the social environment and our schools with their extremely biased and narrow, retarded, revengeful mindset on history.
