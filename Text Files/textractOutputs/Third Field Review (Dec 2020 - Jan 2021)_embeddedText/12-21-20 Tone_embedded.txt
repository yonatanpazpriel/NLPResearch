Hello,
I was recently informed that the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum currently in development presents a predominantly negative image of the history of California and the United States in relation to race and racism.
I feel strongly that teaching an entire generation to self-hate is destructive. It is essential that the complete history is presented, good and bad. Stressing the negative is harmful to the students and to the country. Please try to present an honest and complete picture of our history.
