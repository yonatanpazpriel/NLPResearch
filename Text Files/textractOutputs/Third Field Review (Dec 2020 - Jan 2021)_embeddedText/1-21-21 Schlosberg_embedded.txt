Hello,
I take issue with the section on Jewish Americans found on the ethnic studies curriculum. While it is a step forward from last year, you still completely undermine attacks, hatred, and prejudice against Jewish Americans. The number of incidents continues to grow each year, and especially in California.
We are called privileged. I don't feel privileged when I go to synagogue and armed security is outside. I don't feel privileged when I have to memorize the layout of the synagogue in case of a shooter. My own synagogue in Orange County has been graffitied multiple times in the past two years alone, with Swastikas.
You seem to focus on non-white Jews. I applaud you for that because non-white Jews struggle fitting in with both their race and their religion. But the majority of Jews in America are white or white passing.
And this isn't just an American issue -- places like Europe, and Australia are increasingly becoming more anti Semitic -- not to mention much of the Middle East.
But apparently it's almost as if you're condoning hatred because we are white looking. Perhaps tell that to my grandfather who fled Lithuania as a teenager with his two brothers at the start of the war. Of course, his parents, sisters, and nieces and nephews were all killed, and my grandfather died few years later heartbroken and a broken man.
But of course, we've had it easy and privileged.
I suggest you do better and try harder.
