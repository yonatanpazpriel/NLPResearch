From: Nic Shen Sent: Thursday, December 17, 2020 6:24 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Strongly objection to the new curriculum
After review the new curriculum, we are deeply concerned and strongly object that school system to teach critical race theory and critical social identity to our children. These topics have been politicalized to suit one party's preference in terms to gain votes. All races are equity and there should be no particular social identity to be treated with special status. This is too much and must to be stopped! America is no long America, it becomes communism that promote propaganda and ideological issues.
