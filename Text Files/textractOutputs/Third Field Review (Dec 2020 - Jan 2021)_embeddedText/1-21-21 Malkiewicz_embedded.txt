Dear ethnic studies friends,
I find the focus on JEWS concerning.
It seems your ethnic studies curriculum is focused on addressing racism and privilege. While I wholeheartedly affirm that racism remains a problem in society and needs to be addressed I'm not convinced that your ethnic studies curriculum contains the most useful tools to do so.
Jews are the only "minority" group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. Why?
White supremacists continue to racialize Jews as non-white," the curriculum's "Fact Sheet on Jewish American Diversity" acknowledges. But "many Jews with light skin identify with the idea of white-presenting," it reads. "Light-skinned Jews...experience white privilege," while "Jews of color like all communities of color face systemic racism." In other words, the same kind of Jews who, in living memory, were forced into ovens for being non-white, are now identified as white нн or at a minimum, as having "conditional whiteness." This disqualifies most Jews from the solidarity offered to other minority groups.
Also, would white people be considered a minority in California at this point? California's population: 39% of state residents are Latino, 37% are white, 15% are Asian American, 6% are African American, 3% are multiracial, and fewer than 1% are American Indian or Pacific Islander, according to the 2018 American Community Survey.
Please take my concerns into consideration before approving a curriculum that inspires racism which, I think, is the opposite of your intention.
Thank you! Lisa Malkiewicz
