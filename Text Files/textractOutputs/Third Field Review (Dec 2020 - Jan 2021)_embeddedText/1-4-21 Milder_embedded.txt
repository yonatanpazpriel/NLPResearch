From: Larry Milder Sent: Friday, January 1, 2021 10:53 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] ESMC Third Draft
To the State Board of Education,
I am writing to express my support for the third draft of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.
I believe that the teaching of Ethnic Studies can be a meaningful step toward a more inclusive, respectful society.
I applaud the work that went into the Third Draft of the Model Curriculum. In particular, I appreciate the inclusion of lessons on the American Jewish experience.
It is especially important that antisemitism be taught as a form of prejudice, and identified as a continuing challenge faced by American Jews.
I am gratified that the curriculum states the objective that instruction should avoid "advocacy, personal opinion, bias or partisanship."
In keeping with that objective, I urge the Board to ensure that anti-Israel, anti-Zionist, and antiJewish language will not be introduced into the curriculum. These will bias students, and are not in keeping with the goals of inclusion and objectivity.
Thank you for your dedication to the best education for our students.
Sincerely,
Rabbi Laurence Elis Milder, Ph.D. Congregation Beth Emek [address redacted] Pleasanton, CA
