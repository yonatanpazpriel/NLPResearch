From: Andrew Said Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 8:41 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies and Anti-Semitism
To Whom it May Concern:
I am writing to voice my opposition to the anti-semitic characterizations of Jewish Americans in CA's proposed ethnic studies curriculum.
Any and all references to Jewish Americans as "privileged" or "white-presenting" or "white" are baseless and bigoted.
Please do not allow the racist pseudo-science of "critical race theory" to poison the minds of California's students and perpetuate anti-Semitism.
Sincerely,
Andrew Said Sherman Oaks, CA
