From: Ken Son Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:26 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] My Voice
As an educator and a practicing Jew it is important that my voice be heard! The world today has experienced HATE like never before. We are surrounded by extremist groups that need to learn the lessons of HATE. I have followed the ESMC and was extremely disappointed in the prior drafts. PLEASE continue to fight antisemitism by being the voice our young minds need to hear. I appreciate the two lesson plans created on Jewish Americans and especially the reference to anti-semitism. The State Board of Education needs to add the BINAH lesson created by the Anti Defamation League sand use the correct definition of anti-semitism that was adopted during there Obama Administration.
Thank you for allowing my voice to be heard!
