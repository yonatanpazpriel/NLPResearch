Dear Governor Newsom, Superintendent Thurmond, Dr. Darling-Hammond, and Instructional Quality Commission Members,
We are writing on behalf of our organizations with deep concern about California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC). Based on the problematic "Guiding Values and Principles," the ESMC promotes and romanticizes specific political ideologies with no counterbalancing perspective. Guidelines should be added, and the sample lessons revised, to ensure that ethnic studies courses focus on a thorough understanding about ethnic groups, social issues, and civic engagement, without political proselytizing.
As organizations who represent many of the ethnic groups mentioned in the ESMC and who work to educate Americans about the truthful depiction of history, we call on you to ensure there is an accurate portrayal of the perils many American immigrants have overcome as a result of communism.
Tens of millions of Americans trace their heritage to current or former communist countries. This past decade has demonstrated that communism still poses a threat to the human rights of the one-fifth of the world's population who live under communist regimes.
It is vital our educational systems teach the truth about communism to all students. Many victims of former communist countries � Cambodia, Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, and beyond � sought asylum in the United States as a result of the persecution they faced under oppressive communist dictators in their home countries and many victims of current communist countries � from Cuba, China, North Korea, and Venezuela to name a few � take great lengths to come to the United Stated to find refuge today.
We urge you to make significant revisions to the ESMC to address these concerns. Please revise the Guiding Values and Principles of the ESMC to use more precise and inclusive terminology, to align with the State Board of Education's ESMC Guidelines, to build bridges of intergroup understanding, and to ensure critical thinking.
Please see attached for the problematic line numbers.

Associated with/implicated in several murders (of fellow Black Panthers Alex Rackley and Fred Bennett), but charges were dropped or not pressed.
Comandanta Ramona (Sample Lesson 6: line 1125, p. 50)  Comandanta Ramona (1959-2006) was the nom de guerre of an officer of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, a revolutionary indigenous autonomist organization based in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas.  Ideology: far left socialist Marxist ideology; anti-imperialist/anti-capitalist, libertarian socialist, radical democracy, anti-Zionist; seeks indigenous control over local resources
Farabundo Mart� (Sample Lesson 6: line 1130, p. 50)  August�n Farabundo Mart� Rodr�guez (1893-1932), popularly known as Farabundo Mart�, was a Marxist-Leninist activist and a revolutionary leader in El Salvador during the 1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre.

 Became known as a Salvadoran revolutionary and, for many, a martyr for the Salvadorian people; involved in the founding of the Communist Party of Central American and led a communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid. Its goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorians by the use of Marxist-Leninist ideology.
 Helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers.
Frantz Fanon (Sample Lesson 6: line 1123, p. 50)  French West Indian psychiatrist and political philosopher influential in fields of Marxism, post-colonial study, and critical theory.  Fanon argued that violence is a necessary tool of people's political engagement. He scribed violence as the defining characteristic of colonialism and a cathartic reaction to the oppression of colonialism. He wrote about the liberation of colonial peoples. He advocated the theory that some neuroses are socially generated.  Fanon inspired national-liberation movements and other radical political organizations in Palestine, Sri Lanka, South Africa, and the United States.  Black Skin, White Masks is one of Fanon's important works. In it, Fanon psychoanalyzes the oppressed Black person; his work is especially influential on the American liberation struggle more commonly known as the Black Power Movement, the Black Panther Party, and anti-colonial and national liberation movements.

Quote by Fred Ho: "In opposing cultural imperialism, a genuine multicultural synthesis embodies revolutionary internationalism in music: rather than co-opting different cultures, musicians and composers achieve revolutionary transformation predicated upon anti-imperialism in terms of both musical respect and integrity as well as a practical political economic commitment to equality between peoples."

The following sample lessons are from Appendix A: Sample Lessons and Topics. The below suggestions are not part of the lessons.
Chicana/o/x and Latina/o/x Studies:
Sample Lesson 12: Salvadoran American Migration and Collective Resistance (Lines 21822734, p. 98-129)
� Sample lesson should depict why El Salvadorians fled their country for the United States as a result of the violence caused by the Salvadoran Civil War between the military-led junta government of El Salvador and the communist-associated Farabundo Mart� National Liberation Front (FMLN) in order to accurately portray their lived experiences and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and El Salvadoran students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.

Asian American and Pacific Islander Studies:
Sample Lesson 15: Hmong Americans--Community, Struggle, Voice (Line 2776-2979, p. 132143)
� Sample lesson should depict why Hmong Americans fled communist China and Southeast Asia for the United States in order to accurately portray their lived experiences under communism and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Hmong American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
Sample Lesson 19: Vietnamese American Experiences � The Journey of Refugees (Lines 37034108, p. 177-193)
� Sample lesson should depict why Vietnamese Americans fled communist Vietnam for the United States in order to accurately portray their lived experiences under communism and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Vietnamese American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
Sample Lesson 20: The Immigrant Experience of Lao Americans (Lines 4109-4225, p. 194-199) � Sample lesson should depict why Lao Americans fled communist Laos for the United States in order to accurately portray their lived experiences under communism and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Lao American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
Sample Lesson 21: Korean American Experiences and Interethnic Relations (Lines 4256-4523, p. 200-213) Sample Lesson 22: Col. Young Oak Kim--War Hero, Public Servant, Identity (Lines 45244775, p. 214-225)
� Sample lessons 21 and 22 should depict why Korean Americans immigrated to the United States and how the division of the Korean peninsula as a result of the Korean War affected Korean emigration in order to accurately portray their lived experiences and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Korean American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
Sample Lesson 26: Dr. Sammy Lee (1920-2016) (Lines 6108-6111, p. 290) � The description in Lines 6108-6111 is written in a pro-communist way by stating "The communist critique was simply true..." The communist critique referenced here was not essentially communist but rather made by communists. In other words, the injustice identified was not an injustice because it violated any communist principle, but rather because it violated America's classically liberal principles. This is one of the reasons the communists made the criticism--it is a tactic to make one's opponent live by their own rules.

� It is important that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum correctly acknowledge America's imperfections, but it should not imply that the communist alternative is equally valid. Therefore, lines 6108-6111 should be re-written to portray this information in an unbiased way.
Sample Lesson 32: Cambodian Americans--Deportation Breaking Families Apart (Lines 77488815, p. 366-383)
� Sample lesson should depict why Cambodian Americans fled communist Cambodia for the United States in order to accurately portray their lived experiences under communism and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Cambodian American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
Sample Lesson 43: Armenian Migration Stories and Oral History (Lines 11579-11860, p. 551563)
� Sample lesson should depict why Armenian Americans fled Soviet-occupied Armenia for the United States in order to accurately portray their lived experiences under the Soviet Union and why they chose to seek freedom in the United States. In doing so, the curriculum will give a more inclusive overview of their experience and Armenian American students will be more likely to recognize the diversity of their own ethnic experience in the curriculum.
