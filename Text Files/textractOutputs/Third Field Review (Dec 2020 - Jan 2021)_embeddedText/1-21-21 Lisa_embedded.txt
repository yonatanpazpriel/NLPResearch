Hi,
I want to make it known that I do not support curriculum or instruction in Critical Racial Theory. I am a mother of school-age children in California public schools and universities.
I find this subject matter to be incredibly divisive and offensive.
Our country would be better off if curriculum and instruction was focused on teaching the Constitution, the history of this country is one that is based on the teachings of Plymouth. Our country was founded by individuals who came here to live, work and worship in freedom with their God-given liberties! Teach that!
