Dear CDE,
I would like to thank you for listening to my community's concerns surrounding the ESMC thus far and for the revisions that have been made accordingly.
I stand by the IQC's final product, however would like to reiterate the importance of our demands. I ask that you include the link to the IHRA definition of antisemitism in the glossary, so that educators have a clear understanding of how to teach the term. I also ask that you approve this BDS-free curriculum for all school districts, to be sure that no BDS or antisemitism will make its way into the curriculum during the finalization process.
I appreciate my right as a California constituent to influence my children's' education, and with the power vested in the CDE I ask that you continue to act on your responsibility to give an apolitical curriculum to our local school boards, and set this standard for the many states that will follow in California's footsteps.
Thank you
