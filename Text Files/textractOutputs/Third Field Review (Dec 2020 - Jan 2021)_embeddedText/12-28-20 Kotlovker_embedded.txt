From: Debbi Kotlovker Sent: Monday, December 28, 2020 9:27 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Rewrite the ESMC third draft
Hello.
Providing California students with cultural diversity education is a great idea. However, the current draft is lacking. The 'Iceberg' homework exercise is offensive. Labeling people in such a way is what we should be moving away from, not encouraging through homework. And suggesting that Jews have benefitted from is beyond offensive.
Good idea, the execution needs help.
Thank you.
