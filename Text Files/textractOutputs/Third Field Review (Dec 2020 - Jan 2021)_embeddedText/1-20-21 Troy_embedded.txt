From: [email redacted] Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 11:00 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To Whom It May Concern:
I have become aware of the contents of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum and I find it totally inappropriate.
During this time of racial divisions in the United States the current draft promoting anti-semitism and the ideas of right wing white supremacists is outrageous.
President Biden today promoted unity in our country which is the exact opposite of ideas contained in the proposed curriculum.
The proposed curriculum in fact encourages the exact opposite by claiming Jews usurp white privilege and is perpetuating falsehoods much as the Nazis did in Germany prior to WW2.
As a graduate of a California law school I find it outrageous that this type of anti-semitic ideology would be included in the curriculum for California schools.
I hope that good sense prevails and that this vile attempt to brainwash students is eliminated from the ethnic studies curriculum.
