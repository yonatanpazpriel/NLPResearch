Lesson Overview:
Signed on May 6th, 1882 by President Chester A. Arthur, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first law to explicitly limit immigration based on race. This lesson is designed to go further in exploring the causes and effects of the Chinese Exclusion Act through analysis of primary and secondary sources. The purpose is to showcase the conditions in the US that led to a rise in xenophobia, and in turn, race-based policies that defined the Chinese American and Asian American experience in the United States. The lesson will also have students engage in critical thinking through research and a class discussion comparing and contrasting the Chinese Exclusion Act and current immigration policies or proposed immigration policies.

Lesson Objectives (Students will be able to...):
� clearly define the Chinese Exclusion Act and also articulate the stipulations and consequences it had, both in the short and long term.
� research and have a discussion on the Chinese Exclusion Act and its implications towards future immigration policy.
� research on and have discussion on current immigration policy or proposed immigration policy.
Essential Questions:
1. What conditions foreign and domestic led to the creation of the Chinese Exclusion Act? 2. How was the Chinese Exclusion Act an example of xenophobia in the late 19th century? 3. What were the consequences of the Chinese Exclusion Act? 4. How did it impact immigration of other Asians subsequently?

Signed on May 6th, 1882 by President Chester Arthur, the Chinese Exclusion Act was the first in a series of laws explicitly used to limit immigration based on race. It was a product of factors in China and conditions in the United States which led to huge consequences both in that era as well as today. The law changed the landscape for American immigration and set a precedent in policy-making for generations to come.
Chinese immigration to the US began in the early 1800s. Many leaving China were fleeing the economic crisis, political unrest (two Opium Wars (1839-1860), and the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864)) to seek better opportunities. During the Gold Rush and the building of the railroad, they worked as an expendable labor force. Following the Civil War, the Chinese moved into the urban areas and were once again used as cheap sources of labor. It wasn't until the financial panic hit and unemployment skyrocketed in the 1870s that labor unions formed and began to see the Chinese as their competition. Labor unions gained political power and lobbied for laws to limit the immigration of the Chinese. Violence occurred during this era in terms of bodily and property damage. When the Chinese Exclusion Act was signed, the law reflected almost widespread sentiment that the "Chinese Must Go". There was much scapegoating and stereotyping. The law restricted laborers from entering the country and added additional stipulations to the Chinese who wanted to enter. One early advocate for the Chinese and Asian immigration was Frederick Douglass who spoke against the ban, stated that rights of immigrants, even those in the process of immigrating were rights that should be respected and protected by those in power.
This law set a precedent for restrictive immigration, to even where many are still barred from entering the US. The law itself was repealed in 1943, two years after China became an Allied nation during World War II. In June of 2012, the United States Congress passed a resolution of regret, H. Res. 683, introduced by Congresswoman Judy Chu from California that explicitly recognized the un-American actions and policies that unfairly targeted Chinese immigrants. At the time of this lesson's formation, Asian Americans are once again feeling the brunt of xenophobia as hate and racism increased with the fear of COVID-19. Despite decades of contributions, it doesn't take a great deal of fear to once again demonize an entire population.
