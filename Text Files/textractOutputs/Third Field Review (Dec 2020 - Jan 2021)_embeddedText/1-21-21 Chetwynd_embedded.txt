To whom it may concern,
As you may be aware, Jews are much more likely to be the victim of hate crimes then many other marginalized communities, as you can see in the FBI data cited in this study. Even if just for this reason alone, I urge you not to allow the ESMC section of the Ethnic Studies curriculum to unrealistically paint Jews (any Jews, white or of Color) as not facing prejudice or enjoying some sort of imagined privilege.
As someone who has both experienced anti-Semitism but who has also been told that:
� anti-Semitism doesn't really exist � or isn't really that serious � or is probably "just property crime" � or that there is no longer any systemic institutional bigotry and mistreatment of Jews, ...
...I respectfully ask you not to give in to efforts to whitewash prejudice against ALL Jews or to allow the Ethnic Studies course to be about views on Israel and Palestine.
Note too that even leaving this point as ambiguous or vague within the course material will allow those teachers who don't like Jews to interpret the curriculum in a way that fosters hate.
Respectfully yours, Michael (Kitchen) Chetwynd Los Angeles, CA
