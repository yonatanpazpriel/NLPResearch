From: wen liu Sent: Thursday, December 31, 2020 11:29 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Concerns with ethnic studies
To State Board of Education,
After reading the "Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum", I have multiple issues with it:
1. Because ethnic studies is a politically sensitive subject, it should not be taught until high school or college.
2. Due to political atmosphere, we cannot have any critical views of any group without causing a riot.
3. I found it is more about indoctrinating our children to believe that white people are the oppressors and the sources of all our ethnic problems than learning about different ethnic groups. (I am not white).
Sincerely A CA resident
