Dear Mr. Thurmond & CDE,
I am opposed to the new Ethnic Studies Curriculum. Focusing on a perspective of systemic racism and dividing people into oppressors and oppressed based on race is not the way to teach children. It will only divide them even further. It's divisive, by definition and you're dividing people into groups. It's discriminatory by definition. You are using the color of a child's skin to either guilt them for history that is not their fault, or convince them they are victims. Congratulations!
In my opinion, teaching this, is educational malpractice.
If you feel you need to implement this, make it an elective course but do not alter the current education. We are already dumbing down our kids with Common Core and it's backwards approach to science and math.
While you have devoted money and resources to this ethnic studies program, California education is failing our children by sitting them in front of an iPad all day where they learn absolutely nothing. The curriculum is a JOKE.
Putting the education of our children in your hands and the CDE has not proven to be beneficial to our children.
When politicians, political groups and lobbyist get involved the outcome is never for the best of our children. Please consider what you are doing and what you will be ushering in for this generation and future generations.
Sincerely,
Barbara A Reich
