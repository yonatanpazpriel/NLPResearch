From: Samantha Ayala Sent: Tuesday, January 19, 2021 3:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Return Arab American curriculum
Hi,
I am emailing you to demand that you bring back the Arab American curriculum which was created by Arab American educators. The students need an anti-racist curriculum and they can get that from the Arab American curriculum. Some other demands are to align all lesson plans to the guiding principles of Ethnic Studies, re-insert Arab American studies with Asian American studies, and reject debunked definitions of antisemitism.
Sincerely, Samantha Ayala
