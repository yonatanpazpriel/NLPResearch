As an American, a Phd in History from UCLA, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and a Jew, I am stunned that this ES program carries on with the overt anti-Semitic stereotypes that have darkened Western history for centuries and are showing a strong resurgence around the world and in the United States in this 21st Century, stereotypes that one would have thought ended with the six million dead in the Holocaust. One imagines the neo Nazis in the Charlotte demonstrations a few years back smiling at this curriculum as they chant "The Jews will not succeed us." The discussion about whether Jews are white or not, sneakily changing their names to gain "white privilege" is tendentious (has nobody noticed that many ethnic groups � Latinos, Middle Easterners, East Asians--also sometimes anglicize their first or last names). What's worse, is it that some of them even intermarry with members of other religious or ethnic groups; are we supposed to conclude that by doing so Jews are polluting some imaginary Aryan bloodline? Are there reputable historians on the committee that is putting forward such proposals? If so, I suggest you strip away their PhDs and send them back to grad school for a refresher. It is absolutely stunning to me that in California, perhaps the most liberal state in the union, someone would include such ethnic assertions, similar to saying that African Americans are characterized by a love of eating watermelon, and Mexicans spend their time wearing huge sombreros and sleeping rather than working, and Arabs are all terrorists. What comes next? � the centuries old libel that Jews kill Christian children to use their blood for the Matzoh eaten on the holiday of Passover. This retired historian who has been on the Caltech faculty for more than half a century finds this regressive and dangerous language to be intellectually and historically vacant, a
