From: David Shapiro Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 6:43 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] comments opposed to California Ethnic Studies Program
As a California resident, I am writing to oppose the current curriculum for the California Ethnic Studies Program. It give platform and prominence to anti-semitic figures including from the Third World Liberation Front. It makes the completely artificial � and anti-Semitic -- division of Jews based on skin tone into "Jews of color" and "white Jews." As a Jew, I can say we Jews are simply Jews with a common ancestry in the Middle East and we do not somehow divide ourselves based on our skin tone any more than Asians or African-Americans or Hispanics would or should. Many Ashkenazic Jews are physically darker than many Jews from Turkey � again we are not divided by our skin tone and never have been. Why are only Jews divided by their skin tone in this supposedly enlightened ethnic studies program and not any other ethnic and cultural group which also has members of varies skin tones. The Nazi-like suspicion uniquely of Jews who happen to be lighter skin toned as benefiting from some dangerous and corrupting and even defiling privilege is a horrible way to discuss our people who have suffered more oppression than any other people in human history, regardless of our skin tone. The anti-Semitic undertones in the Ethnic Studies Program make is so morally invalid that it immediately invalidates the entire Program, including any valid points that the Program may be making. This Program is being rammed through against significant opposition should be shelved and thoughtfully and significantly edited. Ethnic studies per se is a valid endeavor in our multi-cultural society, but using it as an antiSemitic and anti-Zionist tool is harmful to everyone.
Thank you,
