To whom it may concern, I am a high school teacher and I would like to voice my support for the Ethnic Studies content including content that specifically addresses antisemitism in history and in current times. Also I
would like to Support a pedagogically sound Ethnic Studies course incorporating "core values of equity, inclusiveness, and universally high expectations" (Education Code section 51226.7) to enrich California students' understanding of American history and current events. Thank you for your time and consideration,
