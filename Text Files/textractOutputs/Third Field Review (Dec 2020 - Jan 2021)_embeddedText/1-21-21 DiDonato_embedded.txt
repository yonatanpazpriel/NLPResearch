From: Haley DiDonato Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 6:14 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please stop the racist and antisemetic curriculum!
To whom it may concern:
The current draft of the curriculum celebrates figures who have promoted anti-Semitism (including leaders of the Third World Liberation Front and the anti-Jewish leaders they admire)
Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used. Let that sink in. Jews are the only group in California's proposed curriculum for whom the term "privilege" is used.
There ought to be no discussion about Jews and privilege that doesn't begin by talking about the historically enacted and repeated genocidal ideology that revolves around Jews and privilege. For an ethnic studies curriculum to go traipsing through that discourse without a single mention of its ugly and bloody history is not a lesson about antiSemitism. It is a repetition of it. By itself, that should effectuate a vote of no confidence in the entire franchise.
Surely, a modern-day ethnic studies curriculum wouldn't perpetuate the same antisemetic propaganda that is reminiscent of older times?!
Depicting Jews as imposters and appropriators of privilege -- people who pose as something to which they have no legitimate claim -- has been a frequent anti-Semitic theme throughout history.
Critical race theory is not the historical equivalent of Nazism, but it doesn't have to be: the question is whether an American education will help students widen their sense of "us," or once again, teach students to harden their sense of "them."
Stop this nonsense!
