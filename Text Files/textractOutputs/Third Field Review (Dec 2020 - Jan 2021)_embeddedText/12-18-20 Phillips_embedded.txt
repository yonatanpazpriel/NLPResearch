Hello, I'm a concerned citizen of California. I'm excited for ethnic studies to open doors and hearts to respectful communication.
However, Critical Race Theory promotes racial hatred, division & indoctrinates children with a forced ideology of shame and blame, please don't let this infect the young minds of our beautiful state. California is beautiful and diverse, please don't let these negative ideologies divide us.
Respectfully, Stefanie Phillips
