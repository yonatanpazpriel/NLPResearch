From: Sean Walsh Sent: Monday, January 11, 2021 11:35 AM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Critical race theory
After reading the documentation on proposed educational elements I am convinced that critical race theory is no factual and is a divisive and racist ideaology. Substitute any other race where "white" or "European" appears and you should not only feel uncomfortable but guilty if you support a factually incorrect pedagogy. If creating a more divisive and ignorant population in our society is your goal then this should work.
