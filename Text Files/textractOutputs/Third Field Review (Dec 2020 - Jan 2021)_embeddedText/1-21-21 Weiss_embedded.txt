California Ethnic Studies Commission,

Please stop using demonizing and hateful stereotypes against Jews in your proposed Ethnic Studies curriculum immediately! This is not what California is about! I request that this be stopped and changed immediately and approved by diverse people and groups in the California Jewish community! Stop the Hate!
