My suggestion: drop it entirely.
Failing that, have them be integrated into our already useless english classes as a few lessons and then ignored entirely.
Only 40% of California students are proficient in math, and 50% in english, and you want to waste time with anti-White propaganda? I read the sample lessons and they're so biased that you might as well just call the field Victim Studies. There were also zero sections for various White ethnicities, but plenty for brown and black communities that California doesn't even have any of. The Hmong? Really? There are less than 100,000 of them in California. Less than 0.5% of the population. They get over a dozen pages of sample lessons. There are slightly over 500,000 koreans in California, or about 1% of the population. They get over 100 pages.
By contrast, do you know how many people of German descent there are in California? Over 8 million, they get zero pages.
How many Californian children can name important German figures from California's history? Can anyone on the board? Yet they're nearly a quarter of California's population.
At this rate, you might as well just retitle the entire thing Anti-White Grievance Propaganda. It's utterly pathetic and obviously put together by a non-White with a racist axe to grind.
