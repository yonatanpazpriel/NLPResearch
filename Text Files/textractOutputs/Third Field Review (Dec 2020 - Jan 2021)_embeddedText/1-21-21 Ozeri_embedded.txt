From: [email redacted] Sent: Wednesday, January 20, 2021 10:07 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Objection to Proposal of CA Ethnics Studies Curriculum
Hello,
We are writing to you to Express our discontent with the new proposed California Ethnics Studies Curriculum. As educators, we would expect you to be the first to understand the importance of education in general, and the education of tolerance in particular. Our great country is going through a difficult period in history, one marked with separation which is fueled by misinformation and lack of education. Your review of the ethnics studies curriculum is appreciated and needed. We do, however, disagree with the new proposal. The currently proposed California Ethnics Studies Curriculum surprisingly includes language depicting the Jewish people as privileged, non-white and other misinformation that is anti-semitic. This should not be approved. It will not be accepted. In an effort to educate our students to become tolerant adults and unified Americans, this proposal should not be accepted.
We appreciate your time and support.
Sincerely,
Vardit Ozeri
