From: Aaron Eshaghian Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 1:01 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum
To whom it may concern:
I am disappointed in the ethnic studies curriculum that has been proposed. While I understand there are often two sides to every story, there are not two sides to the antisemitic history that the Jewish people have faced over the course of history. To now claim that the Jewish people are "privileged" (when no other group is described in this way in the proposed curriculum) is to spread and exacerbate the same anti-semitic thinking that is sparking attacks around the world, including at a jewish day school in new york attended by my young cousins. I completely oppose the proposed curriculum and hope that changes are made to address the concerns of the jewish community.
Best,
