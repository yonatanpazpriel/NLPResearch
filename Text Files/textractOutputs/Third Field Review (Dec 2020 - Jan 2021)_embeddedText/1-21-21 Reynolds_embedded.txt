From: Cindy Reynolds Sent: Thursday, January 21, 2021 7:17 PM To: Ethnic Studies Subject: [EXTERNAL] In Regards to ESMC Review
Dear Review Committee I'm writing to ask you to not support the recommendation for a new curriculum on Jewish peoples. With its use of racial distinctions to divide people into white (and therefore privileged) vs. non-white (and therefore oppressed), this new curriculum can serve to further divide people at a time when we desperately need to unite. This curriculum is misguided and can lead to further discrimination, racism and hatred.
Sincerely, Cindy Reynolds
