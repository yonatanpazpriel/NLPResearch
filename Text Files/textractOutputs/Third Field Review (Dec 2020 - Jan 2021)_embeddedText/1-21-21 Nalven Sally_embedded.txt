Remove: Not sound research
Christine Sleeter's paper citing some ethnic studies surveys, etc, was issued in 2011.
Its soundness was rejected by Stanford researcher Thomas Dee and Emily Penner, authors of the 2016 study cited in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. They stated that their 2016 study "i s the first study to examine the effect of any type of culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP) in a quantitative study that supports credible causal inferences."

"Ethnic studies is designed to benefit all students. Christine Sleeter, Critical Education scholar, posits, "rather than being divisive, ethnic studies helps students to bridge differences that already exist in experiences and perspectives," highlighting that division is antithetical to ethnic studies. H er study of the research on ethnic studies outcomes found that instruction that includes diversity experiences and a specific focus on r acism and other forms of bigotry has a positive impact in terms of "democracy outcomes" and higher-level thinking."-- Christine Sleeter, T he Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies A Research Review
"Sleeter's research shows that culturally meaningful and relevant curriculum such as an ethnic studies course, which helps students develop the skillsets to engage in critical conversations about race, can have a positive impact on students."
"In a 2011 report for the National Education Association entitled The Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies, Christine Sleeter stated that: `There is considerable research evidence that well-designed and well-taught ethnic studies curricula have positive academic and social outcomes for students. Curricula are designed and taught somewhat differently depending on the ethnic composition of the class or school and the subsequent experiences students bring, but both students of color and white students have been found to benefit from ethnic studies.'" -- C hristine Sleeter, The Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies, p. viii"

Stanford's Dee and Penner found that "the evidence that is available relies on research designs that cannot necessarily support credible causal inference" such as in Cammarota study: "For example, a small-scale s tated that C ammarota (2007) focused on the `Social Justice Education Project' (SJEP), a `sub-curriculum' fielded among 17 at-risk Latina/o students in a Tucson high school over four semesters between 2003 and 2005."

In November 2019, the Oakland Unified School Board rejected the charter renewal application of San Francisco State Professors Duncan-Andrade and Tintiangco-Cubales' Ethnic Studies K-8 lab school "Roses in Concrete" due to high attrition rates and its students underperforming schools with similar demographics: 92% of its students were below standard in math and 79% were below standard in Language Arts.
