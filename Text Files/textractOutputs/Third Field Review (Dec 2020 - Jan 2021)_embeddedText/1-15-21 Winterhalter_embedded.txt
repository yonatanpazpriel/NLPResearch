I do not support teaching Critical Theory to our children! I find it divisive. I don't think children who are told that they are oppressed will feel as though they can do anything they put their minds to. Children need to be told that hard work can pay off no matter what their race, gender, etc. is. Critical theory will lead to people becoming hateful of those in other groups. Please don't ruin the futures of our innocent youth by telling them that they are a victim or an oppressor. People come to America from all over the world to live the American dream because America is a fair and inclusive place. Teach children to love all people and that all people are equal. There is no need to focus on race, sex, class, etc. Children don't even notice differences unless you draw attention to them. Critical theory actually causes problems to arise when kids should just be happy being kids.
Sincerely,
