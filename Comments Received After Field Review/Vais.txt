Dear Department of Education-Tony Thurmond,  

I was appalled when I heard of this total one-sided/hate inducing 300 pages of the Ethics Study 
Model. How could a 15 person committee create such a model and claim it benefited our youth.  

Where was the truth. All I saw was an attempt to indoctrinate our youth with hate and distrust 
and that poem about the police was just a way to feed propaganda to our youth.  

It is disheartening that the curriculum made it through the DOE it appears without a concern. It 
was only after the public became aware of its extreme bias did the Department admit it was 
majorly flawed.  

I will be following closely and would hope for the sake of our state that the DOE better serves 
our children.  

Note, I have been a member of the public school community in California since 1998.
