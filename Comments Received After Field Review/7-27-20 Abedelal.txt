Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for Arab American Studies as Ethnic Studies 

Hello, 

I am writing in support of Arab-American studies as ethnic studies, and for the ethnic studies 
curriculum to remain as is. I am a proud product of California public education, both as a K-12 
student and as a graduate of UC Davis. I support ethnic studies more broadly, Arab-American 
studies, and the inclusion of Palestinian-American movements. 

Arab-Americans have contributed to larger fights for civil rights, but our contributions 
are  invisible. We are often stereotyped as politically conservative, and this 
curriculum would challenge the narrative that we are a homogenous people with uniform 
ideas. 

Furthermore, Palestinian-American movements must remain on the curiculum. The U.S. 
gives $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel per year. Many have criticized the U.S.-Israeli 
relationship, as there is significant evidence which shows that the treatment of 
Palestinians is connected to a larger military and police industrial complex. Palestinians 
and Arabs have been involved in many movements for equity and justice, and have 
contributed to the field of ethnic studies massively. Our contributions deserve to be 
recognized, and our youth deserve to learn about and be proud of their identity.  

I urge you to vote yes in support of Arab-American studies, and include Palestine as part of that 
ethnic studies. Any revisions about Arabs must be done alongside Arab-American 
scholars, and organizations which directly work with our communities. We, like other 
communities of color, are seeking to regain control over our narratives and history, and 
see the necessity of empowering representation.  

All best, 
Nora Abedelal
