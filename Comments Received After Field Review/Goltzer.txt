Subject: Education, 

It dose not make any seance to teach young American about Palestinian, 
How have one thing in their mind "to destroy the state of Israel". 
For Centuries Jewish immigrant help build America in aspect of life. 
Palestinian did nothing to improve anything, but to Bools Jewish students.  
You do need to teach about the Jewish American Culture and History. 
About the surviving of Jewish during the "Holocaust", about Building Israel from nothing 
to be one of the great Democracy in the Mideast.  
Thank you Josef G
