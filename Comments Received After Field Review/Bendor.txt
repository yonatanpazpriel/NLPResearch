Ethnic Studies, like Survey of World Religions, can serve as a good basic course in the current high school 
curriculum. Done properly these courses can give a good base to young people who are at their early stage of 
learning about critical thinking. In a multi-ethnic society such as ours, this course can have a fundamental impact on 
the next generation.  
The recent article in the Los Angeles Times by Howard Blum and Nina Agrawal titled “Ethnic Studies may soon be 
mandatory. Can California get it right?” illuminates the current effort. As such it is essential that the curriculum be 
unbiased and fair to all of the ethnic groups living within the USA. Pushing a political agenda and complex foreign 
conflicts (e.g. BDS) should be out of scope if the real goal is harmony and empathy between the ethnic groups within 
our nation.  
Focus on uniting us and not fracturing us.
