Subject: [EXTERNAL] Protest against the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted 
by some California school boards and possibly by all. 

To Whom It May Concern, 

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
currently being adopted by some California school boards. 

To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a 
curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, 
singles out Israel for criticism and would institutionalize the 
teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

In particular I object to its promotion of BDS activities to boycott, 
disinvest etc, which are political objectives quoting made up non 
historical events and the promotion of people and figures accused of 
anti-Semitism to achieve political agendas. 

This I view as very poor education as it is essentially propaganda in 
my opinion. It is the kind of education that was carried out in Nazi 
Germany before and during WW2. 
Education should teach people to think, not tell them what to think. 
I feel that education that promotes hatred and the inferiority of a 
sector of society will always divide the nation and thus it will 
slowly move the state towards a dictatorship. 

Your urgent attention and reply would be appreciated. 
Thanks  and best regards, 

David Levin
