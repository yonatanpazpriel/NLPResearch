Dear Superintendent Thurmond:  

On behalf of the Jewish Community Relations Council of San Francisco, the Peninsula, Marin, Sonoma, 
Alameda and Contra Costa Counties, thank you for your public assurances that the current version of the 
Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum will be substantially amended to remove animus toward Israel and 
stereotyping of Jews, and to  include the story of Jewish Americans, as an ethnicity. 

As you know, JCRC, as part of a coalition of 11 JCRCs and Jewish Community Federations across the 
State, as well as the Jewish Public Affairs Committee submitted a rigorous review of the draft Ethnic 
Studies Model Curriculum during the public comment period.  We appreciate that you took our concerns 
seriously. Your leadership has been invaluable in ensuring that the Curriculum will be revised and in 
reassuring Jewish community members across the State that our concerns are being addressed.  

Thank you for the time you have taken to understand the issues and to publicly address concerns raised 
by our community.  We look forward to continuing to serve as a resource to you on matters related to 
the Jewish community and other issues of common concern.  

Sincerely, 

1.
