Soomin Chao, 
I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school boards. 
To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish 
experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism 
and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 
Why would a wonderful state like California align itself with a terrorist opinion? 
I’m sick about this!  My mom and grandparents who lived in California would turn in their graves if this is actually put 
in place.  I fear for the children of California. 
May California vote using their brains, the facts and common sense instead of the agenda of hateful organizations. 
Nancy Mehlman
