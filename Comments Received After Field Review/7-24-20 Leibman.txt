Subject: [EXTERNAL] Rocklin School Building Anti-Racist Name and Curriculum Proposal 

Department of Ethnic Studies, 

My name is Diego Leibman, and I'm a senior graduating from Whitney High School in Rocklin, 
CA. This past October at the Sacramento Archives Crawl, I learned about the forced removal of 
Chinese residents from Rocklin and Placer County, as well as their contributions building the 
local railroad and quarry. I wrote a term paper on the subject (which I would be happy to share 
with you), and I'm now working on getting Rocklin's school board to name a building for a 
Chinese-American. I'm also advocating for the board to adjust the curriculum to include their 
contributions and removal from Rocklin. The school's named for Joel Parker Whitney, who used 
Chinese labor and wrote of their exploitable racial inferiority and likeness to pigs in his memoir. 

I requested the school board add the suggestions to the August 5th meeting agenda, but they 
directed me to public comment. I've launched a petition and commissioned the help of the 
Rocklin Historical Society, along with prominent scholars and advocates from Amherst College 
and the University of Delaware, that have also worked on Asian American projects at the 
Smithsonian. They are also making public comments at the meeting and have written in 
support. 

If you're interested in helping out, I'd love to talk with you. Professor Jean Pfaelzer and 
Professor Franklin Odo are also inclined to connect if you're interested. 

Let me know what you think. 

Best Regards, 
Diego Leibman
