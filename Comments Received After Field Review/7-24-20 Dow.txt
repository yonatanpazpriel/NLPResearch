Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please support Arab American Studies! 

Greetings,  
I hope this email finds you all well. I would like to ask that Arab American Studies are continued to be supported 
under the rubric of Asian American Studies. Arab studies are incredibly important during this time of islamophobia, 
xenophobia and Racism. It is imperative that we include Arab studies including all west Asian American 
experiences within the ESMC.  

Thank you For doing this , 
Isabel Dow
