YOUR current proposal for Californiaâ€™s students is TOTALLY unacceptable and insulting!!! 
The total absence of the Jewish presence in California, which contributed mightily to the best 
ideals in California points, unacceptably, to anti-Semitism and a total lack of history on the 
writers of this negative proposal is shown , since it is totally missing. Having been an instructor 
in California schools at the secondary level, I can honestly attest to the daunting need for a 
thorough analysis of history in California schools and find that your proposal is completely 
lacking in what shouCAMld be taught, along with other items, the profound impact that Jewish-
Americans had (and continue to have) upon California in the sciences, philosophy, sociology,etc.  

Kindly rethink and rewrite your proposals to include and, in some areas, to highlight the 
advances made by Jewish-Ameerican history.  

Thanking you in advance and hoping that this correspondence will have a salutary effect on 
some NEW and important studies, I am 
Carole Bolotin
