Subject: [EXTERNAL] I support the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

I am writing to urge the adoption of the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum, and specifically to voice my support 
for the inclusion of Arab American Studies in the curriculum. 

In this era of Islamophobia and xenophobia, it’s important to include West Asian American experiences in the 
ESMC. 

As a Jewish Californian, I also feel it is critically important to include an honest examination of the history of 
current struggles around Palestine. Far from being anti-semitic (which I would strongly oppose), the defense of 
Palestinian human rights, and the study of the history of the movement to secure them, is an important 
component of educating students about the importance of all struggles against human rights violations; a topic of 
great concern to the Jewish-American community. 

Thank you for taking my views into consideration in your efforts to formulate the best possible curriculum for our 
state’s students. 

Regards, 

Alexei Folger
