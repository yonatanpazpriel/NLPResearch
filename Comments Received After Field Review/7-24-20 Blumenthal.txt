Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Dear Superintendent Thurmond and Chairman Soomin Chao, 

I am writing to you as a retired clinical social worker who spent her career working with 
children and families. I have grave concerns about the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
that is currently being adopted by the California school boards. The reason I am concerned is 
because it fails to discuss anti-Semitism which is plaguing our society today. Moreover, it 
reinforces negative stereotypes of Jewish people and in doing so will encourage more hatred 
and anti-Semitism. By singling out the Jewish state of Israel for criticism, it fails to educate 
children about the complexity of the issues. It will only encourage more anti- Semitism and 
perpetuate hatred of the Jewish people.  
I hope that you can address my concerns by redoing the draft with a more fair stance towards 
the Jewish people so that children can learn tolerance and celebrate cultural differences. 

Thank you. 

Sincerely, 
Lynne Blumenthal
