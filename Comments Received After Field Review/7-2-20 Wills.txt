Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab Studies 

    The attempt to end the Arab Studies program in the Ethnic Studies  
Model Curriculum is being driven by anti-Semites, the Zionists, because  
any reasonable coverage of Araby must include Palestine, the heart of  
Araby. The Palestinians are important for the world as a whole, because  
it was with them that Judaism developed, and so Christianity: they were  
the first majority-Jewish nation and one of the earliest  
majority-Christian nations. Some people do not want this widely known.  
Please do not give in to these concealers of history.
