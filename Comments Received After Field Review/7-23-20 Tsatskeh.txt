Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

I am an educator with more than fifty years 
teaching and supervisory experience. I did 
my doctoral work in the field of Curriculum. 

Ethnic studies should be neutral and 
apolitical. 

This curriculum ignores/erases the American 
Jewish experience; fails to discuss anti-
Semitism; reinforces negative stereotypes about 
Jews; and singles out Israel for unfair, 
unsupported criticism. 

It focuses on publicly and vocally anti-Israel 
figures such as Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.); 
Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.); Womenâ€™s 
March leader, Linda Sarsour; and the late 
White House correspondent, Helen 
Thomas.  Are these appropriate role 
models for California students? 

Do NOT adopt this curriculum.
