Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab-American Studies K-12 program 

I am an educator and a parent. I have been requested by an organization on whose mailing list I 
am, to weigh in on the discussion of the Arab-American Studies program for California K-12. 
I certainly have no objection to inclusion of some instruction about the Arab-American 
experience in the USA, along with, and proportionate to, the many, many other ethnic 
identities that go to make up these United States. However, inclusion of instruction about such 
ethnic groups' political issues, imported from their countries of origin, belong properly in high-
school level classes on world history, geography, and politics, not in ethnic studies.  
Even more importantly, there should be absolutely no role for teaching about the religions of 
such groups, in this case, about the Islamic religion. This is a violation of the basic principle of 
separation of Church and State, and as far as I know, no other religion is taught in public school 
curricula. It certainly was not when I attended California public schools. 
Thank you for considering my opinion.
