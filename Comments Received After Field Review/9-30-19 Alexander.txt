Hello, 

When you discus capitalism as "a form of power and oppression,‚Äù you should also note that without it 
you would not be using a computer, and in fact you would not even be able to use a typewriter to write 
all this. Discard any thoughts of talking to anyone on your smart phone, as the telephone was also 
invented by capitalist. As well as the automobile, television, etc. 

I hope you can see my point, it is only the freedom to be a capitalist that encourages innovation. 
Innovation is discouraged in a controlled society, since failure is also a main component of capitalism.
