Subject: [EXTERNAL] public comment on ESMC 

I wish to urge the IQC to adopt the ESMC, including Arab American studies, which has 
traditionally been part of Asian American studies. I am a high school teacher for immigrant 
youth in the Oakland Unified School District, and I know that my  students would derive 
tremendous benefit from living in a state where their families' experiences, struggles, and 
triumphs are centered in our high school curriculum.  

Given that Arab Americans in particular must contend with so many negative media portrayals 
of their communities and misinformation about who they are, it would be negligent for the 
state of California to exclude them from the proposed ethnic studies curriculum. Here is an 
important chance to provide a factual correction to the pernicious stereotyping of Arab 
Americans and to create a more inclusive California.  

Thank you for reading my comment. 

Sincerely, 
Jennifer Kelly-DeWitt
