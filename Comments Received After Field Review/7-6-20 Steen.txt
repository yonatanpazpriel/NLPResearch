Subject: [EXTERNAL] Keeping Arab-American studies in the ethnic studies curriculum 

To Whom It May Concern 

I'm a resident of California ([address redacted]) and I would like to express my support for 
keeping Arab-American studies within the Asian studies component of the ethnic studies model 
curriculum (ESMC).  

We live in a very Islamophobic age, and it's extremely important that West Asian American 
experiences be included in school curriculums. I insist that the history of the Palestinian 
struggle against occupation be included in the curriculum, as are many other freedom struggles 
worldwide. It is not anti-semitic to promote the defense of human rights.  

Any revisions made to the curriculum that affect Arab-American studies should be made only in 
close consultation with Arab-American scholars and ethnic studies practitioners.  

Sincerely, 
Kevin Steen
