Subject: [EXTERNAL] Arab American studies are crucial within Asian American studies 

Dear Educators: 

Since Jewish domination of the global financial system is no small reason Jewish conquests and 
abuses in the Middle East are so unjustly tolerated, plus at least tacitly to monstrously 
supported by world powers.. 

It is not surprising anti-Arab sentiment is threatening scholarship in California. 

I pray the Instructional Quality Commission stands on the right side of history and justice by 
including Arab American studies in the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. 

While the horrendous inhumane oppression, not least lawless murders of Palestinians are 
horrific to witness, academic institutions have obligations to cultivate truth, regardless how 
unpleasant or heinous. 

Furthermore, curriculum guidelines relating to Arab American studies must be developed in 
collaboration with Arab Americans who are scholars, as well as Ethnic Studies practitioners who 
are Arab Americans. 

With gratitude for your consideration, 

B Dudney, M.D. (retired)
