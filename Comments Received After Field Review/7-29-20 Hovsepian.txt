Subject: [EXTERNAL] I Support Arab American Studies 

Hello, 

I am a student and I support the ESMC including Arab American studies. 
Merging Arab studies into the curriculum would increase the populations knowledge of the 
beauty of culture and history in the south west Asian regions. Many students do not grasp the 
depth of Arabs, Muslims and the whole Middles East. Many people do not even know the 
history of Israel that includes Palestine. Adding Arab American studies increases our intellect 
and decreases our racism and xenophobia against Islam and people of color. After all, the 
origins of the mankind started in South West Asia. We should honor our history and carry it 
with us instead of trying to hide behind misconceptions of different regions of the 
world.  Maybe only then, we can stop people from support wars in the Middle East. 
It would only be acceptable to have Arab Americans scholars and ethnic studies practitioners be 
part of this change actively. 

Thank you very much for your time and I hope this message receives you well.
