Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support the inclusion of Arab American studies. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

The right-wing blowback you are getting about Arab American studies is a perfect illustration as 
to why these studies are needed now more than ever. There is so much ignorance in our nation 
about Arabs and about Islam that it is dangerous here for Arabs and Muslims. Politicians are 
using this ignorance to start needless wars, as was done in Iraq, and to implement other 
destructive policies. In that way, American ignorance has cost us a trillion dollars for useless 
wars not to mention tens of thousands of ruined American lives and possibly a million ruined 
Iraqi lives. 

Sincerely, 
Noel Sanborn
