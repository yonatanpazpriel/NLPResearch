I am astonished that you are proposing to include BDS Movement 
propaganda in your school system.  I will just say this, if your legislature 
passes such a bill, then all of California deserves the judgement and 
wrath that results.  Your hatred for Jews and Israel rivals Hilter’s hatred 
for that ethnic group.  Shame on you.
