Dear Superintendent Thurmond: 

State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction 

(' 

On  behalf of the  California Asian  Pacific Islander (API)  Legislative Caucus, we write in  support 
of the initial  Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum  (ESMC) draft.  We appreciate the efforts and 
expertise of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee and the opportunity 
provided  by the  Instructional  Quality Commission  (IQC) and your office to  continue stakeholder 
engagement for future  revisions to  make the curriculum  even stronger. 

Ethnic studies is  imperative to student learning and  growth. The API  Legislative Caucus has 
advocated for and  championed  legislation to mandate this course in  our schools in  direct 
response to the  needs we have heard from  our communities. 

This curriculum  is  a vital framework for California public schools across the state,  and we  must 
work to  ensure the model curriculum  is  inclusive and free from  bias.  Stakeholders from the API 
community have shared their concerns about the draft and  have submitted their comments.  One 
major concern  is that some API  communities are missing from the curriculum  such  as Korean, 
Lao and  South Asian.  In the  Pacific Islander curriculum,  there are consistency issues such as 
the use of "Guamanian" and  "Chamorro" as  interchangeable. We encourage the IQC to examine 
these comments seriously to  ensure that the diversity of our API  communities are represented 
and that the information is  accurate. 

Additionally,  the API  Legislative Caucus shares the Jewish community's concerns with the 
current draft of the  ESMC as  it pertains to the omission  of anti-Semitism.  In  our current climate, 
we  must provide  our students with  accurate information and avoid  a curriculum that will 
marginalize or promote discrimination. 

We understand that,  as Superintendent,  you  are holding  a statewide series of listening and 
feedback sessions with  stakeholders including teachers,  school districts and  other experts to 
ensure that this  model curriculum  reflects our diversity. We encourage the  Instructional Quality 
Commission and your office to consider the comments referenced  in  this letter as the next 
version  of the  ESMC is  developed. Additionally,  as the initial architects of the ESMC,  we hope 
that members of the ESMC Advisory Committee are also consulted throughout the revision 
process.

Please count on  us as a partner to disseminate information to  our API  communities on future 
stakeholder engagement opportunities. Thank you  for your commitment to  providing  all  of 
California's students with  a comprehensive curriculum that allows students to think critically and 
learn about our state's diversity. 

Sincerely, 

~ld e1i~
