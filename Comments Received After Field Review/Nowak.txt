Anti-Semitism is a form of cancer which the Lord will never allow. HE will have the final say! 

This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient 
to parents, unthankful, unholy, 

Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those 
that are good, 

Traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 

For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, 
led away with divers lusts, 

Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

2 Timothy 3:1-7 

Me and my Christian brothers and sisters will pray for you, but eternal salvation is your choice.  

GOD BLESS,
