To whom it may concern, 

Thank you first for your time and consideration to read my email as a concerned US citizen.  

During these times of heightened social and racial consciousness in our countries history it concerns me that the 
current curriculum being proposed targets a minority with text that promotes antisemitism.  I pray that this is 
something that will be reconsidered and corrected that not only this part of the curriculum but all aspects will be 
treated with the same sensitivity and thoughtfulness.  

Thank you again for all your hard work and responsibility to educate our next generations about the values of 
diversity, tolerance and importance of unity.   

All the best, 
Alex
