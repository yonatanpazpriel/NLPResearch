California Department of Education

Sacramento, CA 95814-5901

Dear Chairwoman Chao and Members of the Instructional Quality Commission:

| appreciate the hard work of the contracted writers and the Model Curriculum Advisory Committee as it
develops a curriculum that will serve as a model for the entire state. As a statewide elected
constitutional officer and former Assembly Speaker Pro Tempore, | have continuously prioritized efforts
to promote diversity and inclusion.

As the author of AB199 (chaptered in 2011) which includes the contributions of Filipinos in World War II
in grades 7-12 curriculum, | believe it is critical that California students are educated about our State’s
rich history and diversity. | write to share my concerns with the current draft of the Ethnic Studies Model
Curriculum (ESMC)}.

In light of recent events, it is more important than ever that we provide our students with complete and
accurate information. Without significant edits, | fear that the draft ESMC would marginalize and
promote discrimination against some of our most vulnerable population. For this reason, | strongly
encourage the Instructional Quality Commission to make substantial edits to the proposed curriculum,
thoughtfully review the public comments you receive, and ensure that the final curriculum is consistent
with the ESMC and State Board Guidelines.

Thank you again for your commitment to providing all California students with a holistic, accurate, and
comprehensive education.

In Peace andi Friendship,

>
