California is economically the strongest state in the USA and it is based 
on growing ethnically diverse population. Ethnic studies will make it 
stronger in the future years and make it a well worth investment.

"The truth shall set you free". The youth deserve the truth and the history 
of the ancestors. Original Native people, are Not immigrants.

I'm signing because it's time we start decolonizing the education system 
by implementing means for self-determination including opening 
consciousness about the socio-economic strata!
