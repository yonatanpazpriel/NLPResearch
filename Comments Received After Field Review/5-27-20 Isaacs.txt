Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum! 

Dear Director Yee, 

I am a parent of a preschool student who will be attending OUSD next year in your district. I 
urge you to put “Students First” by supporting the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum led by 
scholars of color from across California.  Oakland is exactly the kind of city that should stand up 
for our underrepresented communities. 

Ethnic Studies has always been about empowering students of color who are marginalized and 
minimized by our curriculum.  We need to bring this conversation back to the focus of Students 
First, one of our Core OUSD Values.  Our white students greatly benefit from having these 
critical conversations about race, so that all Oaklanders can build skills to navigate our society 
and build stronger communities and neighborhoods. 

Ethnic Studies and more specifically Arab American Studies are important to me because as a 
white person raising a child that will be attending OUSD, it is extremely important to me that she 
gets an education that teaches clearly and succinctly about race and racism in this country. I 
don't want her to learn a whitewashed version of history. More specifically as a Jew, it is 
extremely important to me that my kid learns about Arab culture that is not riddled with subtle 
islamaphobia as OUSD curriculum often can be. 

This controversy is a perfect example of why we need Ethnic Studies and why we must have 
these conversations to address racial tensions in our community, so that we can move toward 
healing, understanding, and solidarity across all of our cultures. 

Please vote YES, thank you!
