Subject: [EXTERNAL] Regarding Arab American studies in the CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

I spent seven summers with Christian Peacemaker Teams in Palestine, observing the 
occupation. As an Israeli soldier explained to me in 2002, what Israel is doing to the 
indigenous Palestinians is no different than what we Americans did to our indigenous 
Native Americans. 

I am a retired high school teacher. I am writing to ask you to keep the California Ethnic 
Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) intact, including the proposed Arab American 
studies. 

Peace and blessing
