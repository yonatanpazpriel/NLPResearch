Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support of Arab-American Studies in the CA ESMC 

I’m writing in support of a strong California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that includes Arab 
American Studies. Anti-Muslim and anti-Arab American political rhetoric, violence, and other 
acts of hate are, as I’m sure you know, at unacceptable levels in the United States today. A 
strong Arab American Studies component to the ESMC would be an important counter to that. 

As a Ph.D. student in cultural anthropology at the University of California (and as an aspiring 
future professor), I personally see the need to have a strong California educational curriculum 
to counter Islamophobic ignorance among California students, so that they enter our UC 
university system with adequate cultural preparation for the multicultural educational and 
work environments that they will find in contemporary California. 

Thank you very much for considering my comment. 

Sincerely, 
Adrian Wilson
