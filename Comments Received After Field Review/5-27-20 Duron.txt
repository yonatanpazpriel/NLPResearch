Good Morning, OUSD Board Members and Superintendent 
Johnson. 

I want to congratulate you for taking a bold and courageous stand to affirm support for the Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum (ESMC) tonight.  I know that Oakland is a leader in offering a required Ethnic Studies course at the 
high school level.  But your resolution for the ESMC signals a commitment to promote it for all students in 
California.  In 1968 and 1969 students at San Francisco State College and U.C. Berkeley went on strike, the longest 
strikes at the university level, to demand their right to learn about their own history and struggles, which resulted 
in the first courses offered in Ethnic Studies.   

I know this history intimately because I was a student at UC Berkeley in 1969 and participated in the Third World 
Liberation Front (TWLF) strike.  The strike and subsequent classes reaffirmed who I am and helped me find my 
voice.  I decided to help my community by becoming an educator.  Thus, from1982 to 1997 I served as a principal 
in Oakland Unified in two elementary schools, one junior high, and one middle school. 

I know that education is the key to opening opportunities for students of color.  Furthermore, Ethnic Studies 
provides a meaningful and life-long impact on the lives of students.  Please continue to do all you can 
as  educational leaders in Oakland to advocate for quality and inclusive curriculum for all of our students.   

In solidarity with you.
