CALIFORNIA  LATINO  LEGISLATIVE  CAUCUS 

November 25,  2019 

Honorable Tony Thurmond 
Superintendent of Public Instruction 
California Department of Education 
1430 N Street 
Sacramento,  CA 95814 

RE: 

Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Dear Superintendent Thurmond: 

State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction 

DEC 

2  2019 

On  behalf of the  California Latino Legislative Caucus (Latino Caucus),  we  write in  strong support of keeping 
the draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum  (ESMC)  process moving forward.  We offer our sincere praise to 
all  the educators, officials and  residents that have dedicated their time and energy to the development of 
the  ESMC. 

For many Californians, the establishment of a model curriculum in  ethnic studies has been  a mission for 
decades.  The Latino Caucus has long supported this mission  and  has prioritized the adoption of legislation 
requiring  the teaching of ethnic studies in  our schools.  At its core, ethnic studies is the  untold stories of four 
main communities of color- African-Americans,  Latinos,  Native Americans and Asian-Americans.  We 
understand,  and  research  has supported, the  importance of teaching  students the  untold stories of 
discrimination and  racism faced  by these communities.  Ethnic studies is a multidisciplinary study centered 
on  anti-racism.  Furthermore,  research  shows that ethnic studies courses give students a pathway to  break 
the cycle of poverty, violence and  incarceration that many communities of color face. 

The adoption of a comprehensive curriculum that accurately reflects the vast diversity and  historical 
significance of ethnic cultures in  our society is  long overdue.  Now more than ever,  California's students, 
who are growing up in  a majority-minority state, deserve the opportunity to  learn the true history of their 
ancestors,  including sobering topics of racial  bias,  legal inequities and  societal  marginalization.  The 
exposure to an ethnic studies curriculum  benefits all students (in  and out of the classroom)  by broadening 
their knowledge of history and  raising  cultural awareness.  Moreover, ethnic studies has a positive impact 
on  academic engagement, better test scores,  and improved graduation rates.

Draft Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Ethnic studies goes deeper than  multiculturalism and the stakes are too high for our students to discard the 
work of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee and  the  Instructional Quality 
Commission.  It is for the aforementioned reasons that we write in  strong support of keeping the process of 
the ESMC moving forward.  We  are grateful that you  are overseeing the  process that will  lead to the timely 
adoption of an  historic ethnic studies model curriculum.  We hope the ensuing  review period will only serve 
to strengthen the draft curriculum  by bolstering  its historical integrity and not substantially delaying its 
finalization. 

Thank you for your consideration of this letter. Our caucus stands ready to  assist you  in this important 
endeavor in  any way you  deem necessary.  Should you  have any questions or need additional information 
please do not hesitate to call  us at (916) 651-1535.
