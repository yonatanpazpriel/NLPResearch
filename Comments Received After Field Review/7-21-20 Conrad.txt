Subject: [EXTERNAL] Comment on critical theory in curriculum 

Hello.  
I am a parent in CA and my two children go to public schools.  
I am writing you today to urge you to not replace critical thinking with critical theory. It is not 
the same thing. Critical thinking requires an open, unbiased mind to take in various, and at time 
contradictory, information and employs logic and reason to eliminate the contradictions in 
order to understand the world. Critical theory, on the other hand, starts with a conclusion 
about power and then forces all instruction to support that initial assertion about power. 
Agenda driven classroom instruction focused that emphasizes critical theory is more accurately 
called indoctrination, not education. Californian math students do not need a component in 
social justice, they need to be able to understand and compute mathematical concepts. ESL 
students should be encouraged and supported to be fluent in English.  
And capitalism isn't racist, either.  
Please, eliminate the "Ethnic Studies Model curriculum" from consideration and keep the toxic, 
corrosive ideology of critical theory out of CA public schools. CA deserves intelligent, capable, 
critical thinkers, not mindless "activists" parroting slogans. 
Thank you.
