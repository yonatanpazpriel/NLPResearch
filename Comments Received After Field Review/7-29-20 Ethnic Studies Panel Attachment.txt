Guiding Values, 
Principles, and 
Outcomes of 
Ethnic Studies 
Teaching

Given the range and complexity 
of the field, it is important 
to identify key values and 
principles of Ethnic Studies to 
aid in guiding and developing 
Ethnic Studies courses, 
teaching, and learning. 

The foundational values of 
Ethnic Studies are housed in 
the conceptual model of the 
“double helix” which signifies 
the interdependence between 
holistic humanization and 
critical consciousness. 

Humanization includes the values 
of love, respect, hope, solidarity, 
and is based on the celebration of 
community cultural wealth.

The values rooted in humanization 
and critical consciousness shape 
the following guiding principles 
for Ethnic Studies teaching and 
learning. Together, these are the two 
interwoven guiding values and seven 
principles Ethnic Studies lessons 
should include. Ethnic Studies 
courses, teaching, and learning will:

1. CULTIVATE

empathy, community 
actualization, cultural perpetuity, 
self-worth, self- determination, 
and the holistic well-being of all 
participants, especially Native 
People/s and People of Color;

2. CELEBRATE

and honor Native People/s of the 
land and Communities of Color by 
providing a space to share their 
stories of struggle and resistance, 
along with their intellectual and 
cultural wealth;

3. CENTER

and place high value on pre-colonial, 
ancestral, indigenous, diasporic, 
familial, and marginalized knowledge;

4. CRITIQUE

empire, white supremacy, 
anti-Blackness, anti-Indigeneity, 
racism, xenophobia, patriarchy, 
cisheteropatriarchy, capitalism, 
ableism, anthropocentrism, 
and other forms of power and 
oppression at the intersections of 
our society;

5. CHALLENGE

imperialist/colonial 
hegemonic beliefs and 
practices on ideological, 
institutional, interpersonal, 
and internalized levels;

6. CONNECT

ourselves to past and 
contemporary resistance 
movements that struggle 
for social justice on global 
and local levels to ensure a 
truer democracy; 

7. CONCEPTUALIZE,

imagine, and build new 
possibilities for post-imperial life 
that promote collective narratives 
of transformative resistance, 
critical hope, and radical healing.
