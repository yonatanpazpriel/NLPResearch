Dear Sir or Ma’am, 
>  
> I strongly oppose the proposed new curriculum teaching that 
capitalism and the free market is bad or even racist. Don’t you realize 
that there wouldn’t be public education without capitalism. I heard that 
this curriculum also includes anti semitic lessons. If this is true, I 
encourage you not to move forward with this radical left wing 
indoctrination of our youth. I will not allow my child to attend any 
school or class that teaches this social indoctrination. I will move to a 
private schools so fast it’ll make your head spin.  
>  
> Here’s and idea.....How about concentrating on teaching reading , 
writing, mathematics. And, most importantly, encourage critical 
thinking. Students should learn how to research and learn all sides of 
public issues and make educated choices. A government that leads 
people around by their noses wrong. Just ask the citizens of Hong Kong 
and Venezuela.
