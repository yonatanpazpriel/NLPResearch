Subject: [EXTERNAL] draft ethnic studies curriculum 

Dear Soomin Chao, of the California Instructional Quality Commission: 

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being 
adopted by California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, 
I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 
criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public 
schools.” This is quite disturbing that such hateful propaganda and a complete 
revisionist history is being proposed by certain groups to advance their political goals, 
let alone even for a moment being considered by any government or branch thereof. 
We should be teaching the next generation true history, sensitivity and academic 
awareness and tolerance-not the hate and vilification offered by those advocating this 
model draft.  

Sincerely, 

William Gersten
