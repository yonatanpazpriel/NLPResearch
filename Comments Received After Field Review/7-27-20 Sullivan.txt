Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Ethnic Studies! Tell Arab American Stories. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

We have to expose kids to a wide range of culture and history before they’ve solidified their 
worldview. It’s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and I urge you to support 
the inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum. Thank you.  

Sincerely, 
Kelly Sullivan
