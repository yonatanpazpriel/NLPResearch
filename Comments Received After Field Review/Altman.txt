The original inquiry follows: 

I think there are benefits to having students study Ethnic Studies, I strongly object to giving anything but negative 
mention to BDS (Boycott, Divest, Sanction - an anti-Semitic movement, cloaked as a social/political movement that 
seeks to undermine Israel's right to exist). alternatively, the curriculum should mention what Palestinians and Iranian 
youth are taught in school, such as "Israel has no right to exist," or "all Israelis should all be murdered."
