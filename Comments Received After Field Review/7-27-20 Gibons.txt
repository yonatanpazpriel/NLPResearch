Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support the inclusion of Arab American studies. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

Students who are learning about different cultures should be able to include Arab culture- 
whether that culture be descended from Abrahamic faiths or any others.  

Please push for inclusion of Arab American culture in the Ethnic Studies curriculum, as well as 
other communities of color.  

Thank you! 

Sincerely, 
Steven Gibons
