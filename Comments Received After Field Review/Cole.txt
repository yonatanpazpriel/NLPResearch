As I’m reading about the backlash against this curriculum I wanted to voice my 
whole hearted support for the curriculum in its original state. California is a 
leader in developing necessary curriculum to educate students on the factual 
history of oppression we have subjected millions of our citizens to over the 
years. Please keep the curriculum in tact and thank you for taking a stand for 
this.
