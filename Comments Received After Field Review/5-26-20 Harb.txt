Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support for the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Hello School Board Members, 

I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft written by teachers 
and scholars from across California. Your support would mean the world to me. Oakland is 
exactly the kind of city that should stand up for our underrepresented communities. 

We have never seen adequate representation of the narratives of people of color in our 
textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the community we live in.  Please support the 
proposed School Board resolution to prevent the censorship and removal of Arab American, 
Pacific Islander, and Central American Studies from the California Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum. 

Arab American Studies are important to me because I never learned about it elementary, middle 
school, or high school. I want Arab American students to learn about their own history. I know 
what it is like to be treated with prejudice because of my background and I hope that by 
implementing this curriculum, young children will learn about other cultures and celebrate those 
differences, rather than fear them and express distrust. Please support the uncensored 
education of Oakland's future, these students deserve to learn about their history and the 
history of their peers! 

The current attacks on Ethnic Studies and Arab American Studies are completely unjust and 
racist, and Oakland should not stand for them. 

This resolution is moving a step toward social justice. From the bottom of my heart: Please 
vote YES on May 27th to support this! 

We are counting on you! 
Serene Harb, member of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center.
