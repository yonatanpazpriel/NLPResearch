Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM! 

Hello, 

My name is Nawal Zahzah and I am an academic, an activist, a sister, aunt, 
daughter, and I am Arab American. Palestinian and Lebanese.  

FIRST OF ALL: I support the ESMC, including Arab American Studies. In this 
era of Islamophobia and Xenophobia, it is so crucial to have a well-rounded 
curriculum that involves ARABS/Arab Muslims/MUSLIMS -  program(s) that 
teach students about global cultures. If we disregard the histories of non-
American people, especially Arabs - we are INSULTING the very core of 
academia. 

FURTHERMORE, AND MORE IMPORTANTLY: Islamophobia is already rampant 
in the united states, and contributes to so much violence against Muslim 
Americans, from all backgrounds (non-Arabs too). REMOVING THIS 
CURRICULUM WILL ONLY ENSURE MORE VIOLENCE - A LAW THAT DENIES 
STUDENTS (and ARAB/MUSLIM FOLK) FROM LEARNING ABOUT ARAB 
AMERICANS/THEIR OWN PEOPLE SENDS A MESSAGE THAT WE AS ARABS 
AND MUSLIMS ARE NOT WORTH OF A PLACE IN ACADEMIA. THEREFORE WE 
ARE SUBJECT TO RIDICULE. AND SUBJECT TO DISCRIMINATION AND 
VIOLENCE. 

If the California schools CARE about the safety and representation of all 
cultures, they would NOT ELIMINATE ARAB-AMERICAN STUDIES FROM THE 
CURRICULUM. THEY WOULD ENCOURAGE THEIR STUDENTS AND FACULTY 
TO ENGAGE IN AREAS THAT IMPACT THE PEOPLE WHO EXIST IN THEIR 
COMMUNITIES.  

California is one of the most diverse states in the world, with some of the 
largest Arab populations KNOWN. To deny the curriculum study of Arab 
people is to DENY Arabs a place in CA as diaspora. TO DENY US, IS TO SEND 
A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE NOT WELCOME. That's RUDE. 

Beyond that, the topic of PALESTINE should remain a crucial topic of 
engagement in academia. PALESTINE and the PEOPLE of Palestine have a 
right in history, especially now more than ever when Israel's VIOLENT 
actions against the people of Palestine are so visual and apparent. IT IS 
NOT ANTI-SEMITIC TO LEARN OR RESEARCH PALESTINE OR ITS 

  
 
 
 
 
 
 
PEOPLE. PALESTINIANS HAVE BEEN AND ARE ENDURING THE VIOLATION 
OF THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS, IT IS NOT ANTI-SEMITIC TO SAY SO. IT IS A 
REALITY. IF YOU IGNORE THAT FACT, IT DOESN'T GO AWAY. IT ONLY 
SERVES TO 1) EMBARRASS THOSE WHO DENY THAT REALITY AND 2) 
CAUSE FURTHER VIOLENCE AND DISCRIMINATION ON THOSE WHO ARE A 
PART OF THOSE COMMUNITIES.  

To DENY Palestinian rhetoric is to DENY THE EXISTENCE OF REAL 
PEOPLE/COMMUNITIES. Past AND present. 

MY FATHER IS PALESTINIAN. His parents were FORCED out of Palestine in 
1948 and ended up in Southern Lebanon. I am a Palestinian. My PEOPLE'S 
HISTORY MATTERS. I AM NOT ANTI-SEMITIC. I oppose Zionism, but I do 
not hate Jews. I am SIMPLY against the justification of Zionism - which is a 
direct threat against the human rights of Palestinians. 

I demand that revisions that impact Arab American Studies should be made 
in collaboration with Arab American scholars and Ethnic Studies 
practitioners.  

TURATH - (Teaching Understanding and Representing Arabs Throughout 
History) is a 2020 report researched and written by teenage members of 
Arab Youth Organizing (AYO). According to their findings, more than 66% of 
the students surveyed said they received most of their information on 
Arabs/and or Muslims from the INTERNET or TELEVISION; only 2.3% 
learned about Arabs/Muslims at school. 

What a SAD notion that as an education board, you will be deciding if this 
sort of education should remain strictly imported through the 
internet/television and not enriched, supported, encouraged, through 
institutions.
