Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM 

I am the proud parent of a kid who attended San Francisco Unified School District from 
preK to high school and is now attending out-of-state university. I have also worked as a 
sign language interpreter within in SFUSD schools for over 20 years.  

I am writing in support of including Arab American Studies within the Asian American 
Studies rubric. I feel that it is important to include the struggles for recognition and 
acceptance that all people in our society undertake. Especially now, in this time of 
heightened Islamophobia and xenophobia, all of us must support members of those 
communities bearing the burden of exclusion and marginalization. 

Moreover, as a Jew, I feel that it is incumbent on me to stand in support of the struggles 
that Palestinian people are going through right now; both those who remain in their 
homeland and those who have been displaced and are currently living throughout the 
diaspora.  

I ask that not only Arab American Studies be included in Ethnic Studies but that any 
changes to the curriculum be made only in consultation with experts in those specific 
fields of study. 

Thank you.
