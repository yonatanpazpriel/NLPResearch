Your ethnic studies curricula seems designed more to divide people than to unite people as Americans. 
Very disturbing is the anti-Jewish teaching. Hitler was right? Jews are evil? The state is hiring radical 
Muslims to twist history - and to encourage violence against Jews. Perhaps you are ignorant of the fact 
that the Muslim Brotherhood helped Hitler during WWII. I know the family of Representative Omar of 
Minnesota were terrorists - perhaps some of those to whom you have turned to teach this evil have 
terrorist backgrounds. This state has many real problems - the threat of typhoid and perhaps plague have 
materialized due to mismanagement by the state and local governments - homelessness, losing people 
that actually pay taxes - just a few examples. Do we really need to stir up hatred in our young people - 
Israel, at its beginning actually told the non-Jews that they could stay - but the Muslim countries around 
them told them to leave because they were uniting to exterminate the Jews. Israel won that battle - a 
miracle considering they were outnumbered. The Muslim countries helped create the Palestinian problem 
- and won't own up to it. 
Perhaps our tax money should be used to make sure all children are able to do math, read and think 
critically. History should be taught truthfully and not used for political agendas. 
Thank you.
