I need to find current information regarding the proposed multi-cultural school curriculum. I have recently learned from 
two members of the CA State Legislature's Jewish caucus that the portion or the curriculum presenting information 
about Jews is at best inaccurate and patiently leaning toward openly anti-semetic. As an educator for the past 52 
years, including 30 of them at UC Berkeley, in education and as the author of a (ancient) book titled "Reducing 
Adolescent Prejudice," and as a Jew--WWII refugee--for the past 76 years, I am deeply and understandably 
concerned. Please direct me to a copy of the proposed curriculum and let me know who has proposed it and who 
supports it. My colleagues and I await your assistance. Thank you, Nina Gabelko
