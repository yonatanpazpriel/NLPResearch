Subject: Sikh inclusion in CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

Dear Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee, I am writing today to request the meaningful inclusion 
of Sikhism in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum for entry into the public record  

My name is Bhavneet Sandhu and I live in Sacramento California. I attend NP3 High in Natomas School district and I 
am in grade 8. I want this inclusion to take place because I have always felt judged and made fun of for not cutting 
my hair when other girls would. I want this inclusion to happen so that the kids in my grade can understand what 
being a Sikh means and why we donâ€™t cut our hair and why we believe it to be sacred. This inclusion could improve 
the lives of other Sikh students that have to go through this form of racism.  
Thanks
