Dear Superintendent of Public Instruction Thurmond, 
I am alarmed after reading the proposed content of the draft 2020 ethnic studies model curriculum. The curriculum 
does not allow for alternative viewpoints on the value of free markets and does not mention the Jewish minority 
experience. I am hoping it will be revised. Many thanks, 
Mike Spinrad
