Subject: [EXTERNAL] Support the inclusion of Arab American studies. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I am a granddaughter of Jewish immigrants. As a first generation Californian, my ethnic 
background differs from most of the people with whom I reside, strive for a stronger 
community, and vote. While my exact lineage has been obscured by thousands of years of 
dispossession and dislocation, there's a good chance both sides of my family originate from 
West Asia/the Middle East.  

What I can unequivocally state is that if there are "pro-Israel" groups pressuring the State of 
California to reject an Ethnic Studies curriculum that includes Arab American experiences and 
histories, they don't speak for me. These kinds of interventions serve to protect one narrow set 
of interests by actively undermining the interests of others and the social fabric which binds us 
all to each other.  

I am also a public school teacher. For the Arab Americans in my classroom, and for their fellow 
classmates, I urge you to please keep California's Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) 
intact, including the proposed Arab American studies curriculum.  

For all of us, please do not succumb to well-funded political organizing with a long history of 
priorities and responsibilities counter to the role of the IQC. 

Sincerely, 
Mich Levy
