Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft (ESMCD) 

To Whom It May Concern,  
I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by 
California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support 
a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, 
reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for criticism and would 
institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools.” 

This move is an end-run around legitimate concerns about anti-Semitism and anti-Israel bias in 

the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft. 

It’s time to put the brakes on this controversial, radical curriculum that omits the Jewish 

perspective and promotes an anti-Israel agenda!
