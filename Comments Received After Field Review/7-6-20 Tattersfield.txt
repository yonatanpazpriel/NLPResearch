Subject: [EXTERNAL] PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES AND ETHNIC STUDIES 

Hello, 

My name is Dri, and I am a college student in Southern California interested in the education 
field as well as a current resident of Siskiyou County, California. I strongly support the CA Model 
Ethnic Studies curriculum, including the inclusion of Arab American Studies within Asian 
American Studies. As an Asian American, solidarity across the entire Asian/Arab diaspora is 
important to me. In this current moment, understanding Palestinian history, American violence 
in the Middle East, and xenophobia and Islamophobia is critical for California's students to learn 
in order to become responsible members of California's diverse community. Additionally, the 
formation of the ethnic studies curriculum should include Arab American scholars! We cannot 
form a full curriculum without them.  

Thank you, 
Dri
