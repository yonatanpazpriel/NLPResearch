To Whom it may concern: 
The thought that ethnic studies would include many Anti-American 
subjects is reprehensible!!!  Please think over the inclusion of material 
that is Anti-Semitic and Anti-American.   We need to be a united 
country again and dividing us into little groups that are fighting against 
one another is the best way to “kill the goose that laid the golden 
egg”!!!!  Please rethink your inclusion of these materials in your choices 
for curriculum in the Public School system. 
Sincerely, 
Linda G Ray
