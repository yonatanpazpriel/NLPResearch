Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please do not remove Arab Americans from our states curriculum 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

Itâ€™s never been clearer how important Ethnic Studies is and we urge you to support the 
inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.  

Students need to know that many of the underpinnings of Western civilization -- numbers, the 
concept of zero, and much medicine -- actually originated in the Muslim world or in Asia. 

Sincerely, 
Vera Rushmer
