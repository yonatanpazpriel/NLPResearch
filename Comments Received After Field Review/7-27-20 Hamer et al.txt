Jose Iniguez 

Chair, Instructional Quality Commission 

California Department of Education 

1430 N Street 

Sacramento, CA 95814-5901 

Dear Mr. Iniguez: 

We find ourselves at a moment of national reckoning surrounding racial injustice, and 

engaging in a long overdue dialogue across the nation about institutional racism, police brutality, 

and how disparities by race touch every aspect of American life. Meanwhile, white nationalism 

and hate crimes persist worldwide.  

As graduates of the California public school system and as interns with the San Francisco 

and Los Angeles offices of the American Jewish Committee, we write today to express our firm 

support for an Ethnic Studies curriculum in California K-12 schools. Following the traditional 

framework for Ethnic Studies, this instruction should center upon the history and oppression of 

the African American, Latinx/Chicanx, Asian American, and Native American communities. 

Now more than ever, education must be used to shine a light on the 

ongoing experiences of these 

groups with systemic racism and marginalization, including in mainstream high school curricula. 

We agree strongly with the Ethnic Studies coalition’s argument that Ethnic Studies 

instruction will improve the engagement, retention, and academic performance of students of 

color. It is important that students in California’s high schools be able to recognize themselves, 

their families, and their lived experiences in what they learn in the classroom. 

In the current curriculum draft, we are pleased also to see discussion of critical historical 

events and movements that for far too long have been left out of the public school classroom, 

including the experiences of Southeast Asian immigrants and the racial enclaves they created in 

California, the forced removal of California Native American tribes and the creation of 

reservations, the plight of undocumented immigrants and DREAMers protected by DACA, and 

the history of redlining and greater trends of anti-Blackness and privilege in the United States. 

 
 
 
​
Additionally, we appreciate that the curriculum places emphasis on civic engagement and 

action, a worthwhile inclusion for high school students. In several lesson plans, students are 

encouraged to discuss issues they care about with their elected officials, host events, and 

cultivate conversations within their communities. This is a crucial element to educate students 

about their civic responsibility, and illuminate their agency and ability to enact meaningful 

change. It is essential that California students are equipped with the skills to challenge the 

structures of inequality in our state and nation. 

But, fully addressing these critical social issues 

need not and should not come at the cost of excluding or demeaning other ethnic groups.

There 

can be no comprehensive analysis of white supremacist ideology, then, without interrogating the 

role of antisemitism.  

From the outset, we would like to acknowledge that antisemitism is not one in the same 

with anti-Blackness and racism against people of color. While racism against people of color 

remains systemically embedded in American institutions and culture, today white-passing Jews 

benefit from white privilege and can perpetuate white supremacy. Consequently, the Ethnic 

Studies Model Curriculum should undoubtedly center the experiences of institutionally 

minoritized groups; our call is for antisemitism to be additionally analyzed as a form of hatred 

propagated by white supremacist power structures which persist in the United States. Our goal is 

to uplift our persecuted community through discussion of the Jewish American experience.  

White supremacist violence motivated by a hatred of non-Jewish people of color often 

blames Jews and Jewish institutions for America’s racial diversity. According to the “Great 

Replacement” conspiracy theory advocated by the mass shooters who attacked the Tree of Life 

Synagogue in Pittsburgh and Chabad of Poway, immigration and demographic change represent 

an intentional genocide of America’s white majority masterminded by the Jewish collective. 

Before murdering eleven Jews at prayer, the Pittsburgh shooter 

posted

 the following 

message on Gab: “

hias [Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society] likes to bring invaders in that kill our 

people. I can’t sit by and watch my people get slaughtered. Screw your optics, I’m going in.”

 In 

this way, racial and religious animus toward other minoritized groups, particularly African 

Americans, Latinx Americans, and Muslim Asian Americans, propagates symbiotically with 

antisemitism. 

 
​
​
 
​
​
​
​
​
We respectfully request that the revised Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum (ESMC) 

reflect the following core values: 

1. The curriculum should not explicitly or implicitly endorse antisemitism 

The first draft of the ESMC contained material which implied Jewish control of the 

media, grossly oversimplified the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and uncritically valorized the 

Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, whose founders are open about their 

desire to end the Jewish state of Israel. Song lyrics such as Shadia Mansour’s verse in Sample 

Lesson 2 of the Arab American Studies Course Outline paint Israelis as colonizers and 

propagates the antisemitic trope of Jewish control of the media. Linda Sarsour, a past co-chair of 

the Women’s March with ties to Nation of Islam leader and open antisemite Louis Farrakhan, is 

listed as a potential significant figure to cover in class. This is not appropriate material for an 

Ethnic Studies curriculum which ostensibly seeks to challenge stereotypes and bigotry. 

Similarly, the 

African American Studies Course Outline includes 

Hebrew Israelites

 and the 

Nation of Islam

 as suggested spiritual and religious groups to cover. While these groups may be 

important aspects of the Black religious experience in America, they are also known purveyors 

of antisemitism. Without providing students with context, classroom instruction on such figures 

and groups will serve only to legitimize hate and antisemitism. We are grateful that the 

Department of Education has committed to removing references to BDS for the ESMC’s second 

draft, and we hope that the content of the second draft provides no further cause for concern. 

2. The curriculum should define and analyze antisemitism and its relationship to white 

supremacist, anti-Black, anti-Latinx, anti-immigrant/refugee, and Islamophobic 

bigotry 

The first draft of the ESMC failed to define antisemitism, much less discuss the central 

role that Jew-hatred plays in white nationalist ideology. While an entire lesson plan is rightfully 

devoted to the discussion of Islamophobia in the United States, a definition of antisemitism is not 

even provided in the Glossary. Both terms should be clearly defined and their impacts on the 

Muslim and Jewish communities should be discussed in the curriculum. As addressed above, 

 
 
​
​
​
​
 
antisemitism is crucially different from anti-Blackness and other forms of racism. This 

distinction is an important aspect of this conversation, as is the inclusion of instruction on 

antisemitism for high school students seeking to critically understand extremism in modern day 

America.  

3. The curriculum should discuss the Jewish experience in America and California 

through the Ethnic Studies framework 

The Arab American Studies Course Outlines, which we strongly support, includes 

detailed, high-quality lesson plans about Arab immigration to the US, the challenges of Arab and 

Muslim Americans in contemporary social/political contexts in the United States, and 

Islamaphobia. However, the curriculum contains only four one-word references to Jews. The 

only mention of Jews in the ESMC draft connects to offensive Arab stereotypes (ex. insulting 

Palestinians as “terrorists [who] blow up airlines, try to ‘destroy Israel’ and ‘drive the Jews into 

the sea’”) or a brief mention of Jewish immigration.  

To be genuinely inclusive and accurate, the curriculum should discuss the rich history of 

Jews in the United States, including but not limited to Jewish immigration, the building of strong 

Jewish communities throughout the U.S., their contributions in varying industries, and the 

challenges faced by Jews in employment, housing, in the form of hate crimes, or as scapegoats 

during national hardships. This is particularly important because the ESMC stresses that 

curriculum content should be representative of the local population; there are over 

1.18 million 

Jews in CA

, representing 3% of the state’s population. Further, the substantial diversity within 

California’s Jewish population ought to be reflected in public education; 

11.2% of American 

Jews

 identify as people of color. While we understand that a semester-long course cannot 

reasonably be expected to teach all there is to know about every ethnic group, much less every 

ethnic subset, it is important that students learn about the diverse backgrounds from which Jews 

originate. Jews are not a uniformly light-skinned people descended from European immigrants. 

In fact, the Jewish Diaspora resulted in a number of distinct Jewish cultures with unique 

regional, ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and religious characteristics. Some of these subgroups 

 
 
​
​
​
​
include Ashkenazi (Central to Eastern Europe), Sephardi (Iberian), Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and 

North African), Persian (Iranian), Beta Israel (Ethiopian), and others.  

4. The curriculum should address the experience of other important ethno-religious 

groups in California, including Armenians, Assyrians, Hellenes, Hindus, and 

Koreans. 

In addition to the Jewish American narrative, we support an interfaith-interethnic 

coalition which stands for representation 

of Armenian, Assyrian, Greek, Hindu, and Korean 

communities in the ESMC. We envision an Ethnic Studies curriculum which allows students to 

gain a deeper understanding of and appreciation for the diverse ethnic composition and cultural 

diversity of our nation by recognizing and discussing the vast history and contributions of 

California’s many ethnic groups. 

As Jewish American students who recently graduated from California public high 

schools, we have personal experiences regarding the scarcity of information about Jewish history 

and antisemitism in the classroom. Beyond perfunctory lessons on the Holocaust during study of 

the Second World War, there is often little if any attention paid to the rich tapestry of the Jewish 

American experience. Many of us recall the resulting discomfort from poorly taught lessons on 

the Holocaust, serving as the resident Jewish students in the token class about Jewish history.  

Unfortunately, as we have discussed, the first ESMC draft contained similar pedagogical 

issues. As written, the draft curriculum will not provide a deeper understanding of the Jewish 

experience. More importantly, the erasure of Jewish representation and the inclusion of offensive 

material will likely foster hostility and discrimination both inside and outside the classroom.  

Governor Newsom

, State Superintendent 

Tony Thurmond

, the 

, 
State Board of Education

and 

many others

 recognized the harm that this early version could cause to our collective 

community. We look forward to a future curriculum that upholds the State Board of Education’s 

affirmation of a curriculum that is “accurate, free of bias, appropriate for all learners in our 

diverse state, and [aligns] with Governor Newsom’s vision of a California for all.” The Ethnic 

 
 
​
 
​
​
​
​
​
​
​
Studies curriculum is crucial; when it is inclusive, holistic, and pedagogically sound, it will be a 

curriculum that we will all be proud to see implemented in our schools.   

We urge you to ensure that the ESMC Committee makes the necessary changes to 

remedy the problematic elements in this first draft, and to finalize a curriculum that reflects the 

diversity of peoples and rich history of our great state.

Additional comments from signatories:  

“It would be a travesty to exclude the Jewish community from Ethnic Studies curriculum given 
how frequently, consistently, and severely the Jewish community has been targeted both 
historically and in present day.” 
Lucie Everett 
-

“This is a step in the right direction! We need everyone to have a voice in the process of crafting 
this curriculum.” 
Emily Harari 
-

“Jews are a group of people who have been continuously oppressed and used as a scapegoat for 
many different reasons in a variety of different countries. Please include the experience of Jews 
in your ethnic program. We are ethno-religious, not only a religion.” 
Jenna Bruck 
-

“Thank you for your letter. Having not only had no ethnic studies education but also having 
experienced a teacher propagating anti-Semitic views in the classroom, and in light of rising 
anti-Semitism across the American political spectrum, it’s important to me that California both 
establishes this curriculum and makes the suggested modifications to educate students about 
anti-Semitism and the Jewish experience.” 
Emily Szasz  
-

“When people call Jews ‘oppressors’ they are lumping Jews from all over the globe of every 
color. We are one big community indigenous to the land of Israel, centralized via Jerusalem. This 
is like referring to Native Americans as ‘oppressors’ of immigrant Americans, neighboring 
Canadians, Central and South Latin Americans. No educated individual would say, do, or teach 
such a thing.”  
-Kahli Clarke

“Please do not use education to socially marginalized Jewish people. Education should foster

“This is deeply troubling. I support having ethnic studies curriculum, but not one that unfairly 
demonizes the Jewish people.”

“We’re living in an age where every voice can have weight, even those spreading 
misinformation that can have deadly results. Ethnic studies are so important, but take the time to 
get it right and include all groups who have suffered oppression. This curriculum is an outrage. 
You can’t fight hate with more hate. And the facts are easy to find if you care to look.”
