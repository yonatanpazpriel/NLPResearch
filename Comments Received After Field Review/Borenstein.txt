Dear Sir and Madam, 

I want to share with you my deep concern the California Department of Education's Ethnic 
Studies Curriculum which focuses on Anti-Israel sentiments. 

The place of an Education department is to educate children all perspectives and the 
history/perspective of all ethnic groups. This curriculum perpetuates Israel as an apartheid state 
and for many people of all religions and groups that is factually incorrect and hurtful.  

Please know that this comes off as a Department teaching a one sided perspective instead of 
educating individuals on Israels right to exist and the struggle of co-existence with the 
Palestinian people. There is a way of educating young minds in a productive manner, but that is 
not productively done with a one sided perspective. Children shouldn't be given answers, but 
rather information and abilities to continue to ask questions and seek truth. 

I believe having both Israel and Palestinian educators sit down and create a co-curriculum with 
the heroes on both side who are not related to terrorist ideology is a much more productive and 
ethical way of doing things. 

Please do not implement what you currently put together, to me it is unethical. 

Thanks, 
Talia Borenstein
