Issue:  

The state of California has introduced “blatantly anti-Semitic and anti-Israel” lessons into 
its official high school curriculum, drawing outrage and concern in the state’s Jewish 
and pro-Israel communities, according to multiple sources involved in the controversy. 

They want to teach and encourage school children to join the Boycott , 
Divestment Sanction (BDS) movement against Israel until Israel complies 
with international laws.  

The anti-Israel activist allege that Israel is oppressing Palestinians by 
occupying the territories. Their definition of complying with international law 
is Israel’s withdrawal of the occupied Territories and dismantling it’s walls.  

The California Department of Education is permitting a host of anti-Israel activists to 
build a statewide educational curriculum that demonizes the Jewish state and is said to 
be fostering hatred of Jewish and Israeli-American students, sources said. 

My Views: 

I am strongly opposed to teaching Anti-Semitism in schools. This is 
reckless and irresponsible to teach children to go against Israel and/or 
Jewish people. Israel has a right to exist and defend their nation and it’s 
people. 

Indoctrinating children and promoting divide and hatred against Israel and 
the Jewish people is simply WRONG! 

Instead of indoctrinating children on left wing propaganda, children should 
be taught academics, such as reading, math and science.
