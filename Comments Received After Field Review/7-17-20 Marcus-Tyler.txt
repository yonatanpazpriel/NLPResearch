Subject: [EXTERNAL] Include Arab American Studies in CA Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Hello,  

I am a CA resident and am writing in support of ESMC, including Arab American studies. Arab 
American studies is an integral part of Ethnic Studies. In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by 
Trumpâ€™s Muslim ban, Arab American students are desperately in need of curriculum that 
reflects their histories and current realities.  

Sincerely,  
Eliana Marcus-Tyler
