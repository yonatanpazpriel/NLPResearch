Subject: Anti-Semitic Legistlation 

Earlier this month, I learned of a new proposed model ethnic studies 
curriculum that is antisemitic and anti-Israel.  It omits any information about 
American Jews and antisemitism, uses classic antisemitic stereotypes and 
tropes, glorifies BDS and is blatantly anti-Israel. This curriculum is intended to 
be used in all California public high schools, and, if a pending bill (AB 331) is 
approved by the California legislature, all students will be required to take at 
least one course based on this curriculum to graduate. 
Arenâ€™t we better than this in CA? Do we have to take the model of the extreme 
right movement, who know how to kill our children and blame Jews, Muslims 
and other? Sham on all legislators that proposed these studies. Do thei really 
want to show how anti-Semitic they are. If the vote passes, we will definitely 
understand who to vote for in the next elections.
