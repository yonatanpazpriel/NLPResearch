Draft (ESMC), and urge you to maintain the powerful 
Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching
the root from which this framework was founded upon: achieving 
helping students develop 
California Department of Education (CDE) has done in support of LGBTQ+ visibility, 
family acceptance, and gender identity inclusive policies. However, we want to remind 
you that the CA-ESMC draft furthers this work by centering Trans, Non-Binary and 
Queer Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) who founded the movements 
that have paved the way for these important discussions to take place. The framework 
should be a tool used to support BIPOC in school by giving them a perspective of their 
story that is representative of their community cultural wealth. The CA-ESMC would 
teach all students that the struggle for LGBTQ+ visibility, acceptance and gender 
inclusion were initiated and led by Black and Brown Trans, Non-Binary and Queer 
activists, such as Marsha P. Johnson and Gloria Anzaldua. It is imperative that you 
keep the 
in the original draft
communities throughout the document.    

Guiding Values, Principles, and Outcomes of Ethnic Studies Teaching present 
, as well as the language and framing that supports LGBTQ+ 

In light of the recent global pandemic, the emerging economic recession, and 

racial injustices, as a coalition of Queer educators and community organizations, we ask 
the CDE to join the fight to address these ongoing challenges. Through understanding 
powerful language and terminologies contained in the CA-ESMC, students and 
educators may bring up the conversation for racial and systemic change in communities 
across California in specific and nuanced ways. Yes, this includes recognizing the value

and importance of terms that were the target of closed-minded criticism from those who 
wish to maintain the oppressive status quo, terms found in the CA-ESMC draft and 
which need to remain within it, including: “cisheteropatriarchy, heteronormativity, 
transphobia, herstory, hxstory, hxrstory, womxn, xdisciplinary, misogynoir, two-spirit, 
nepantlas, Fa’afafine, Fakaleti, and Mahu”, and having the courage to think beyond rigid 
binaries and the limitations of traditional disciplines. Words represent concepts, to 
censor our language, is to censor our thinking, and our being.  

With youth understanding these dynamics of power, students will be able to 

confront both patriarchy and cisheteropatriarchy, as well as racism and white 
supremacy, which perpetuate violence against our most vulnerable communities: 
LGBTQ+ Communities of Color. Ethnic Studies can fundamentally transform the very 
conditions that have allowed injustice and inequality to exist by uplifting our stories 
courageously through teaching and learning. This year alone, twenty one Trans and 
Gender Expansive people have been murdered in our country—the vast majority Trans 
BIPOC. The CA-ESMC Draft directly works to address and combat Transphobia. Our 
coalition members who are queer educators are already integrating these powerful and 
 into our classrooms, and they must remain.

Guiding Values and Principles

Detractors of this field of thought have stated that the curriculum will cause 
divisiveness, or that the terms are “jargon”, as if queer BIPOC students cannot access 
academic language, including that which directly results from the CA State Board of 
Education guideline that the ESMC disciplinarily also connect with Gender Studies. It is 
racist and riddled with low expectations to not allow students to encounter this academic 
language; as educators, it is our job to teach and “scaffold” content-specific academic 
language accordingly, not deprive our students of the language and concepts 
themselves. We urge you to not listen to pressures from status quo whiteness and 
heteronormativity. We appreciate the solidarity from the Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum Advisory Committee, and now it is upon the CDE to not dilute or exclude this 
language of the field.  

We want to make it clear to the CDE that the 

original Guiding Values, Principles, 

 and descriptive language of the CA-ESMC all foster cross-cultural 

Outcomes,
collaboration, empathy, and understanding. These, we believe, are the elements of 
 and we urge you to not dilute the ESMC draft in any of these 
authentic social unity,
regards. The time for Trans Queer racial educational justice, through concepts and 
language that apply to our lives and to intersectional Ethnic Studies, is now; please 
respect this and do not negate or erase it in the curriculum. 

In hope for solidarity,
