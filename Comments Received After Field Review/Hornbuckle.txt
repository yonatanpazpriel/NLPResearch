Dear Sirs: 
I love Capitalism and free enterprise. The American people have 
benefited from it over the years. Socialism has major problems, as 
evidenced by what is going on in Western Europe now. People should 
have to qualify for, and earn things, like education and healthcare, in 
order to value and appreciate them. We have lowered standards in this 
country to the point where everyone gets everything and takes it for 
granted. Then things like a college degree, are no longer worth 
anything.  It is not racist to have a merit based system. I taught 
business, psychology and math classes at the community college level 
for seventeen years. Many of my students on scholarships were not 
qualified to be there and had to take remedial classes. There were 
other qualified, deserving students who were not admitted. This was a 
travesty of justice to me. I also taught four groups of international 
scholarship students from primarily Central American and the 
Caribbean. They did well and received their Associates Degree. They 
had to return to their own countries at the end of the two year 
program, even though they did not want to. It was a requirement of the 
program that they try to better their own country, rather than escape 
to ours.  If you work hard and are successful, you should not feel guilty 
about it and you should not be forced to share your good fortune with 
others, unless you choose to. There are a lot of slackers out there that 
want free handouts without putting forth any effort. They donâ€™t try to 
assimilate and learn the language.  They make demands. The American 
Dream is equal opportunity to earn a living not being given an equal 
amount of everything. Thank you.
