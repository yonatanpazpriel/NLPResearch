Subject: Capitalism is not racist 

The new curriculum for the public schools in California is an absolute travesty for the 
United States of America. The notion that capitalism is racist is appalling!  Every legal 
US citizen (and many, many illegal aliens) is able to make as little or as much money as 
they want to make. As of now, we are still a free country.  Circumstances of race, 
gender, where are you were raised, etc., in determining your fate is hogwash!  You are 
belittling the people of color in this country who have actually made something of their 
lives! If you are determined enough you can rise above your circumstances!  What the 
education department is doing is going to make America the dumbest country on earth!   
The ultimate goal of the liberal is to dumb down America so that we will fall into their 
oppression. All of this junk about loving one another is an absolute farce.  The liberals in 
the government are trying their best to suppress individuality, although that is what they 
are trying to make us believe that they are promote with all of the transgender, etc.  
beliefs you are forcing on our children.  I suppose the root of the problem is that we’re 
not allowed to believe in the God of the universe anymore. We have to believe that 
people are their own God.  We and our children are not allowed to worship God 
anymore. People are more open to worshiping Allah in this country than God anymore. 
Christians are being persecuted in the United States of America and it’s starting in 
California. It’s a shame that our children are being raised to hate and that’s exactly what 
you’re teaching.  

Try telling the people who have made millions and millions of dollars in your Silicon 
Valley that capitalism is the great villain in America.
