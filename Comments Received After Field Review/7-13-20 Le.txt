Subject: [EXTERNAL] Save Ethnic Studies! Tell Arab American Stories. 

Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

I am writing as a resident physician, a public health professional, and the daughter of 
Vietnamese refugees. I am calling on you to support and protect Ethnic Studies through the 
inclusion of Arab American studies in the Asian American studies curriculum.  

The racial disparities in the impact of Covid-19, the xenophobic targeting of Asian Americans as 
“vectors” of disease, and the national uprising in response to the murder of George Floyd point 
to the need for anti-racist education. I strongly believe that all students need comprehensive 
Ethnic Studies in their K-12 curriculum.  

The goal is to build empathy, unity and solidarity.  

The ESMC is structured around the core pillars developed by the founders of Ethnic Studies in 
1969: American Indian studies, Africana/Black studies, Chicanx/Latinx studies, and Asian 
American studies. Following a decades-long tradition in higher education, the ESMC includes 
Arab American studies within Asian American studies.  

Leading Asian American scholars, including the National Association of Asian American studies, 
have issued statements defending the inclusion of Arab American studies in the CA ESMC.  

Ethnic Studies has been linked to increases in positive personal, academic, and social outcomes 
for students.  

In the post-9/11 era, exacerbated by Trump’s Muslim ban, Arab American students are 
desperately in need of curriculum that reflects their histories and current realities.  

I strongly support this campaign and call on you to do everything in your capacity to support as 
well. 

Sincerely, 
Annie Le
