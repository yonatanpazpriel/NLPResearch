Subject: [EXTERNAL] California Schools Anti-Israel Curriculum 

To whom it may concern, 

I am writing to ask you to change the anti-Israel hate and bias that is in the process of being adopted in 
the California school curriculum.  Why is anti-Israel hate and bias being promoted and being allowed to 
happen?  Would you allow this to happen if it were a different minority group?  Haven’t the current 
events in the Black Lives Movement shown us that intolerance is not acceptable on any level but yet we 
are going to allow it to happen in schools?  This is outrageous and must be stopped. I don’t want my 
children, or any others, to be brought up with bias and hate. Schools are supposed to be places of 
learning, discussing, understanding, tolerance and acceptance.   Let is continue to perpetuate these 
qualities in school and not introduce any bias and hate at all to ANY minority. 

Please, please, as a mother and a humanitarian, please do not adopt this curriculum, change it and make 
it fair, supportive and tolerant of every group. 

Thank you in advance, 

Sincerely, 

Judy
