Hi, 

I'm Catherine from Addiction Resource.  

We're a young organization dedicated to raising people's awareness about the dangers of addiction. We 
provide advice on recovery and assign consultations concerning substance abuse treatment for 
struggling people regardless of insurance, financial and ethnical status. Such organizations as Get Smart 
About Drugs (https://www.getsmartaboutdrugs.gov/find-help), New Jersey Communication Association 
(https://njca.rutgers.edu/communication-programs-in-new-jersey/) and universities 
(https://veterans.oregonstate.edu/local-state-and-national-resources) have found us useful. 

We would be grateful if you could place a link to AddictionResource (https://addictionresource.com/) on 
your resource page to promote drug-free lifestyle. We look forward to your feedback.  

Warmest regards!
