Subject: [EXTERNAL] Please reject Radical Anti-Israel Curriculum 

Dear Lt Governor, 

Please reject the ESMCD’s “Arab American Studies Course Outline,” which 
promotes anti-Israel boycotts (BDS) and focuses on figures accused of anti-Semitism, 
such as Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour, Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and 
Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and deceased White House correspondent Helen Thomas.   

My God, what is more blatantly anti Semitic than this course curriculum?   Otherwise 
please reference the 850,000 Jews expelled from Arab countries in 1948, or the 
plight of Native Americans, or the ordeals that Asian Americans endured along with 
Hispanics.   

My question is WHY only Jews? 

Are Hamas and Hezbollah sympathizers drafting these materials?  Why not anything 
about the oppressive Arab regimes which are ALL Muslim?   Orwell is alive and well. 

Thank you for at least reading my deeply held objections.   I'm sorry but I find all of 
this originating from an alternative-universe Arab/Nazi police state propaganda 
department. 

Respectfully, 
Michael Peck
