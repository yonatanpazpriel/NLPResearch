If you're going to run pro-Palestinian viewpoints- you HAVE to run pro Zionistic viewpoint. 
How else will you teach your students to think if you only let them have one side of an 
issue? Build critical thinking- be fair. 

This move is an end-run around legitimate concerns about anti-Semitism and anti-Israel 
bias in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft.You can do better for your 
students...
