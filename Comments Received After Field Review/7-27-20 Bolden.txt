Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

We’re required to learn American History in school, but you can’t have American history 
without Native American history, Black history, Latinx history, Asian-Pacific Islander history, 
Italian history, LGBTQ+ history, Muslim history, etc. America is nicknamed “The Melting Pot” for 
a reason. We are a well blended, diverse country.  

I didn’t get an in-depth understanding of my Black history until I took African American Studies 
in college.  

In order to keep history from repeating itself, we need to learn about everyone’s history. 

Sincerely, 
Dyamond Bolden
