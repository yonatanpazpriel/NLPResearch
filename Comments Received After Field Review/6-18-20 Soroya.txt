Subject: [EXTERNAL] In Support of Arab American Studies 

Hi. I am an Early childhood educator and program coordinator for childcare/after school 
programs. Every day I read on my social media about racism in the pandemic.  It is our 
responsibility to provide the tools and opportunities for our children to be their best, 
have knowledge of our world, teach empathy and compassion. I thought: if only we had 
ETHNIC STUDIES!  Then the kids will be taught about why we as a society need to do 
better.  

Big shout out to voting to support Ethnic Studies. Big, big kudos. 

Best,  
Shaista Soroya
