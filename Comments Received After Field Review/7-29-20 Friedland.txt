Subject: [EXTERNAL] Public Comment in support of Arab American included in CA Model Ethnic Studies 
Curriculum 

I am a public school teacher in California with five years of experience, and I know, with every 
fiber of my being, that Ethnic Studies is a necessary course for all students, and that Arab 
American studies must be a part of that curriculum. 

As a Jewish person, I believe that the movement to erase Palestinian history and struggle for 
liberation is deeply unjust. The Zionist regime of Israel is founded on the ethnic cleansing of the 
Palestinians, and the ongoing occupation is inhumane and cruel. We must not side with the 
Zionist Israeli regime and lobbyists here in the US, just because they are well funded and 
powerful, and claim anti-semitism whenever Palestinian freedom is brought up. We must stand 
on the correct side of history, which is fundamentally with those who would include Arab 
American studies in our Ethnic studies, including the history and struggles of the Palestinians.  

Revisions to this curriculum must be made in collaboration with Arab American scholars and 
experts, or it defies the very ethos of having an ethnic studies curriculum at all.   

Please heed these pleas and do what is morally just. Include all voices, all struggles, all histories. 
Do not exclude based on fear, division, and money. Our students depend on you to make the 
right decision in order to start building and creating a world free from systemic oppression. 
That starts here- with the stories we tell, and the stories we hide. 

Please include Arab American studies in the Ethnic Studies curriculum. It is necessary and right. 

Sincerely, 
Becca Friedland
