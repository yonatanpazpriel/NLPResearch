I am very disturbed and concerned with the proposed 
curriculum for ethnic studies for the State of CA. It is 
blatantly anti-Semitic with it's derision of Israel and one 
sided approach to the very complex Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict, and feeds into stereotypes that are historically 
anti-Semitic tropes that have ZERO place in our education 
system. As a life long CA resident and taxpayer, I am 
ashamed that such a curriculum could even get approved 
to the stage it has. It must be stopped in it's present form 
and revised to accurately reflect the situation concerning 
Israel/West Bank/Gaza and be purged of it's obvious anti-
Semitic bias.  
Thank you, 
Jerry Merksamer
