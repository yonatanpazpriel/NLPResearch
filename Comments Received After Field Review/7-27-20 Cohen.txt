Subject: [EXTERNAL] Your ethnic studies curriculum is limited biased and ultimately among other 
things....Antisemitic 

A curriculum that lauds antisemites with little academic background eg Linda Sarsour denigrates an attempt at 
education and fairness. 
Your exclusion of the Jewish or Armenian experience underlines your lack of true education regarding ethnic 
concerns . Your students will be the poorer and their lack of fair and unbiased information will Breed further 
racism and antisemitism. 
I am disappointed in Californiaâ€™s stance.
