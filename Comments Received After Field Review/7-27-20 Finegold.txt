Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti-semitic curricula 

To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 
currently being adopted by California school boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish 
Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American Jewish experience, fails to 
discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 
criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic  and anti-Israel statements, in our 
public schools.” 

Does your curriculum include the following?  Why not?  Without him, Washington loses the war 
of Independence!

from Poland during the period of the American Revolution. He helped convert the French loans into
