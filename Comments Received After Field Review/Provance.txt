Dear Superintendent Thurmond: 

Due to concerns about the recent politicization of a proposed Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum by its drafters for anti-
Semitic and anti-Israel indoctrination, it's clear that it is not enough for CDE to merely mandate a re-write of the 
current draft's curriculum - the problem is much bigger than one curriculum. I join many others in urging you to 
prevent any future attempts to hijack our state’s educational curricula by establishing robust safeguards capable of 
ensuring that the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum, and all other state-sponsored curricula and instructional materials, 
are not created or used as tools of political indoctrination that promote hatred and incite harm against any race, 
religion, group or individual.  

As a taxpayer, consumer of California’s public education system, and a student who experienced significant anti-
Semitism in California’s public school environment with no satisfactory results by school administrators, I fear you are 
heading down a dangerous path of institutionalizing racial hatred in our schools. With a significant rise in anti-
Semitism in our communities, on college campuses, and now the possibility that a blatantly biased curriculum could 
be part of every public high school in California, it is incumbent upon me to express my opposition to this proposed 
and biased curriculum. 

California can and must do better. 

Thank you, 
Kate Provance
