Subject: [EXTERNAL] Anti- Semitic school curriculum 

Sir:  
The new proposed public school curriculum  is anti- Israel and anti- semitic and I strongly urge you to discard it 
entirely . 
This type of activity is agenda driven and subversive and has no place in America and especially in its school 
curricula! 
Sincerely,  
Myron ?Berg
