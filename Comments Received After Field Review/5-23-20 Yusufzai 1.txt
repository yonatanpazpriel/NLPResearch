Subject: [EXTERNAL] Prevent Censorship - protect justice 

Hello School Board Members, 

I write to ask for your support of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft written by teachers 
and scholars from across California. Your support would mean the world to me. My family and I 
have lived in District 3 for over 38 years.  

We have never seen adequate representation of the narratives of people of color in our 
textbooks, despite the enormous diversity of the community we live in.  Please support the 
proposed School Board resolution to prevent the censorship and removal of Arab American, 
Pacific Islander and Central American Studies from the California Ethnic Studies Model 
Curriculum. 

The current attacks on Ethnic Studies and Arab American Studies are completely unjust and 
racist, and Oakland should not stand for them. 

This resolution is moving a step for social justice. From the bottom of my heart: Please vote 
YES on May 27th to support this! 

We are counting on you! 

Peace
