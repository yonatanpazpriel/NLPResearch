Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curriculum 

Greetings: 

As a first generation Arab American of Iraqi dissent, I support including Arab American 
history and culture as part of the ethnic studies curriculum being considered at this 
time.  I have a daughter, a senior this year in HS, and a son, going into 8th grade, who 
would be proud to read about their history and culture in their classrooms. Please don't 
bow to political pressure to remove or amend the curriculum. Let the experts in the field 
of study do their work on the subject and reject attempts to have our history told through 
a political filter.   

Thank you.
