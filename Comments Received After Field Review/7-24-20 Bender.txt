Subject: [EXTERNAL] I am concerned about the wording on certain pages of the new ethnic program 

It is 350 pages long so it is easy to overlook the blatant antisemitic phrases.  
If this is meant to enlighten students to a fair and balanced view on reality, it is doing the opposite    I strongly urge 
certain pages to be changed so we don’t produce students who don’t understand the real history of Israel and the 
Middle East.   This program guarantees a sharp rise in antisemitism and more crimes against our fellow Jews.  . I 
don’t think that this was the original intent of the program.  So please reconsider your curriculum to be fair and 
not so hateful and not true  
Thank you Stella Bender
