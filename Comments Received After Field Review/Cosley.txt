Subject: Changes to curriculum 

I was shocked to hear that the proposed ethnic studies curriculum will 
present capitalism as oppressive, BDS as a credible option and that 
mathematics is racist.  Cis-heteropatriarchy?  This is insanity.  My 
husband, yes, you’d probably consider us part of the cis-
heteropatriarchy, are planning on retiring in a state that is more free, 
less oppressive and, hopefully, more sane. 
I homeschooled our sons for 6 years.  Best decision I’ve ever made. 
You will be teaching California’s students to be weak, triggered, 
infantile whiners.  Fortunately, our sons were spared such exposure. 
Good luck.
