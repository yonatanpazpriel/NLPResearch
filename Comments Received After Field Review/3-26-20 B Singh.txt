Subject: Sikh inclusion in CA Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum 

 Dear Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Advisory Committee,  

I am writing today to request the meaningful inclusion of Sikhism in the California Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum for entry into the public record.  

My name is Bhupi Singh and I have been a resident of California since 1989. I live in Santa 
Barbara and am an Executive Vice-President at one of the largest nonprofits in CA, Direct 
Relief. 

I am extremely disappointed that the Sikh community, which has been an integral part of 
California’s history and economy since the early 1900s, is not represented in a meaningful way 
in the initial Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum draft.  

There are approximately 250,0000 Sikhs in California. A report by the Sikh Coalition found that 
turbaned Sikhs are bullied at a rate double the national average. I wish to reiterate that the 
inclusion of Sikhism, the world's fifth largest religion, in the model curriculum in a meaningful 
way, is an essential step in overcoming ignorance and in reducing bullying and harassment.   

Specifically, I request:  

1.  A detailed lesson plan about the Sikh American community to be inserted into the 

Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum.  

2.  More specific examples throughout the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum that focus 
on the myriad of positive Sikh contributions made over 125 years in California, to 
balance the current language’s focus on the hateful backlash against Sikhs in the 
context of post-9/11 Islamophobia.   

The Sikh Coalition and the Jakara Movement will be in communication with you soon, specifying 
the details of these requests. I ask that the recommendations made in their forthcoming letter be 
incorporated into the final Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum on my behalf.  

Yours sincerely, 

Bhupi Singh
