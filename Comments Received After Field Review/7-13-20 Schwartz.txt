Subject: [EXTERNAL] Another Jew Supporting Arab American Studies in the EMSC 

Hello, 

My name is Ysh Schwartz and I am a resident of Berkeley, CA. I am writing today to express my 
strong support of the current Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum, including Arab American 
Studies.  

I urge you all to include Arab American studies in the EMSC, especially the history of Palestine 
and resistance of the Palestinian people. As a Jewish person, Israel does not speak for me or the 
Jewish people. Conflating Israel with Judaism is antisemitic. The Jewish people are not a 
monolith and there is a mass movement of Jewish people around the world who oppose the 
occupation and land theft of Palestine. My Jewish values and ancestors have taught me that our 
freedom as Jewish people can only come through solidarity, not through land theft and violent 
occupation.  

Growing up in California public schools, my history as an Ashkenzai Jew was always taught, but I 
cannot say the same for my Palestinian friends. All history of violence and oppression should be 
taught, so that injustice can be fought by future generations and history cannot repeat itself. 
Please remember that the telling of one oppressed people's story does not erase another's, but 
rather emboldens them and unites us all against oppression. 

As a young, Jewish, lifelong Californian, I urge you to support Arab American Studies in the 
EMSC - please stand on the right side of history! 

Sincerely, 
Ysh Schwartz 
Berkeley, CA
