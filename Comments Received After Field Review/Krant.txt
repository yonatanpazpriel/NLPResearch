Re: Ethnic Studies Curriculum - My husband and I have learned the truth about what this new curriculum has hidden 
behind what appears to be healthy lessons, but that is a LIE. When digging deeper into its hidden agenda, we 
actually do find that “Capitalism” is grouped into the same category as “White Supremacy” and “Patriarchy” and is 
presented as oppressive. THAT IS A LIE wanting to indoctrinate the youngest of students, but it is evil and 
unAmerican. I understand it presents Israel as an enemy and not worth our respect or support. AGAIN WRONG AND 
EVIL! This disgusting ideology wants to change what America stands for and take all of its gained success and 
progress backwards into a new and suppressive hateful socialistic society. It is an unAmerican indoctrination at its 
core and is from the pit of hell, and I for one would like to know who actually is behind its writing. My husband and I 
are two legal proud American citizens who are completely against having this disgusting curriculum ever adopted! We 
can only hope that there are still some Godly sensible people who work at the Department of Education who care 
about not warping the minds of our students. WE SAY NO AND NEVER! We are two people who are sick and tired of 
the fake news and lies coming from the radical left and this is just part of that same disgusting ideology. PLEASE 
GET RID OF THIS CURRICULUM FOREVER! The truth has been revealed and God is watching!
