Subject: Sikh Inclusion in CA Ethnic Studies Model curriculum 

Dear Advisory Committee  

I am writing to ask for inclusion of Sikhism in the California Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum. 

My name is Dr Daljeet Singh and I have lived in CA since 1985 , attended UC Berkeley as an 
undergraduate and saw first hand how vibrant their Ethnic Studies program became.  I work as 
a Family Physician at Kaiser Permanente and have 2 children who are in high school and middle 
school. 

When I attended North Hollywood High School , there was almost no mention of Sikhism or any 
other South Asian community in our entire education. Thankfully now my kids have noted 
improvement and a very brief mention of our community. 

I have many friends whose children have been teased or bullied due to our visible appearance- 
particularly after 9/11 and even in todays political environment. For years in text books  Sikhs 
were categorized within Hinduism and then mistaken as Muslim in greater society. 

During my time in Northern California I saw members from Yuba City tell me stories of early 
Sikh immigrants who came over 100 years ago , some by foot from Panama and made California 
their home. 

I feel strongly that the Sikh community should be included meaningfully in the Ethnic Studies 
Model Curriculum draft. 

Thanks for your consideration 

Dr Daljeet Singh
