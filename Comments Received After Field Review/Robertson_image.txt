_ L write to add my voice to that of the thousands of Californians and numerous organizations and
coalitions that have expressed alarm over the current drat of the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum
(ESMC). In its current iteration, the ESMC falls fall short of its goal to “prepare pupils to be.global
citizens with an appreciation for the contributions of multiple cultures,” as a result of its erasure of, and
at times hostility to, the American Jewish experience, and its one-sided representation of the highly
complex and disputed.conflict between. israel and the Palestinian people.

I support and draw your attention to the detailed comments submitted by the Instituic for Curriculum
Services and the Jewish Public Affairs Committee, as well as by Jews Indigenous io the Middle East
and ‘North Africa and the Legislative Jewish and LGBT caucuses. Among the concerns shared by these
broad-based and diverse groups are 1) the omission of Jews as. an ethnic group and of anti-Semitism as
a form of bias and prejudice; 2) the negative stereotypes of Jews and Israel; and 3) the inclusion of, and
support for, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which presents a single, divisive
viewpoint on a complex issue and creates a hostile environment for those. who disagree with or
question its principles.
