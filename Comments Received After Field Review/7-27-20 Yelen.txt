Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

To the attention of Soomin Chao via email at ethnicstudies@cde.ca.gov 

This is in reference  to any Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft which is 
being considered by many California school boards.  The board members, 
as I understand things, are not either being made aware of or are not being 
sufficiently made aware of the fact that these curriculums would reinforce 
negative stereotypes about Jews, would single out Israel for criticism and 
would further institutionalize the teaching of anti-semetic stereotypes in our 
public schools.  It would be a curriculum that erases the American Jewish 
experience, and it would fail to discuss anti-Semitism.  On the contrary, it 
would emphasize and encourage anti-semitism. It is bad enough that there 
is so much unjustified anti-semetic feelings going around, but for our 
schools to take a direct, positive part in furthering these unfair, prejudicial 
attitudes - this should not happen.  What our children are taught in schools 
and what they are subjected to is what they will naturally think, feel, and 
believe is OK and acceptable. This Draft is not OK nor acceptable.  The 
school boards must be made aware of what this Draft really is about and 
really what its goal is. It is dangerous to America , to American values and 
ideals, and should not be allowed to be in our school systems. 

Sincerely submitted, 

Barry A. Yelen, Esq.
