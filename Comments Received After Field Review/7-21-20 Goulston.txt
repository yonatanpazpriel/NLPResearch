Dear Ethnic Studies Open Comment, 

As a Jew, it's complete and utter bullshit that pro-Israel groups would use our name to try and 
erase Palestinians from the public conscious. This kind of nationalism is something that tears 
people apart, regardless of whether it comes from the white house or a couple of fringe 
organizations. Judaism is a diaspora, not a country, and those who claim that Israel and Judaism 
are the same are being disingenuous. 

As a Sac State student, I sincerely want to learn about the culture and history of those we are 
often pitted against in the popular narrative. As this country continues to be torn apart by a 
hateful administration, we cannot forget the importance of peace and solidarity. I will not sit 
back and watch these fringe nationalist groups claim the name of my people for the purpose of 
erasing others. 

I ask that you keep the CA Model Ethnic Studies Curriculum, and more importantly, to pass it 
without removing the Arab American studies curriculum. Don't let right-wing groups tear apart 
a chance at solidarity. We can do better. 

Sincerely, 
Lillian Goulston
