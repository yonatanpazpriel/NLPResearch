Dear Curriculum Committee: 

I am aware of the curriculum on ethnic studies you are developing. Excluding the inclusion of the 
Jewish people’s significant contribution and cultural diversity as well as the global anti-Semitism and 
exclusion of other ethnic minorities Hindus, Koreans who also make up a substantial portion of 
California’s residents is just wrong. I urge you to extend the deadline for comments and to create a 
curriculum that is truly inclusive. Please do not help to perpetuate the divisiveness that has a stronghold 
on our communities and our nation. 

Thank you,
