Subject: [EXTERNAL] Reg: Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft 

Dear Mr. Chao,  

I am writing to protest the Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Draft currently being adopted by California school 
boards. To quote the California Legislative Jewish Caucus, I “cannot support a curriculum that erases the American 
Jewish experience, fails to discuss anti-Semitism, reinforces negative stereotypes about Jews, singles out Israel for 
criticism and would institutionalize the teaching of anti-Semitic stereotypes in our public schools. “ 

It is extremely disappointing to see that whilst every other form of bigotry is in sharp decline, antisemitism is at an 
all time high. As an ethnic German I can tell you that my people learned the hard way, where these ideas 
eventually lead. It was called the Holocaust and it resulted in the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish women, 
children and men. This number only reflects those victims if whom  we are certain. Many historians now place the 
number as high as 20 million. Surely you agree that we cannot ever allow this to ever occur again. The 
overwhelming majority of people have absolutely no idea how dangerous these ideas really are. Trust me when I 
tell you, that my people and I KNOW all too well. It is a soul searing, collective shame that haunts the heart of 
every German. We Germans are still fighting to purge the last remnants of it from our community. Turn around 
and run away from this hate as fast as you possibly can. You do not ever want to be involved with it. It can and will 
take a person’s soul.  

Thank you, sir, for your attention regarding this matter.  

Sincerely, 

Forrest Roy Reinke
