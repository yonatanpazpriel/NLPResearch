Subject: [EXTERNAL] INCLUDE ARAB AMERICAN STUDIES IN CA ETHNIC STUDIES CURRICULUM 

To who it may concern, 

My name is Elsa Contreras and I am a third year doctor of occupational therapy student at 
Samuel Merritt University. As a San Francisco native, and as someone who received a minor in 
Ethnic studies from Humboldt State University, I value that voices of ALL ethnic and Indigenous 
peoples be included in California Ethnic Studies curriculum. As a Mexican-Salvadoran America, I 
value global solidarity, which includes learning the histories of other ethnic groups and 
DEMAND that Arab American Studies be included in California Ethnic Studies Curriculum. As a 
future occupational therapist who will embark on international relations and fighting for 
occupational justice for all marginalized groups, I urge you to not silence the history of our Arab 
sisters and brothers within California Ethnic Studies curriculum. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
Elsa Contreras
