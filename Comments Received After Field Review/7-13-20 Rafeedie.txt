Hi Everyone, 

I'm e-mailing about ethnic studies in the state of California. My wife and I are Arab and our 
daughter starts kindergarten next month. We're hoping you ensure she doesn't have the same 
struggles we had growing up with respect to history and ethnic studies. We had to climb too 
many mountains to get our master's degrees and our daughter doesn't deserve the same 
treatment. 

We never learned about Arab history, Palestine, or heard from Arabs about culture when we 
were growing up. That's because our school systems (in Ohio and Southern California) were 
racist. We had to work twice as hard as other students just to get the same basic education. 
That is, to learn about OUR history. That's dehumanizing and it should stay in the past.  

We insist that the school systems allow Arabs to tell about current and historical events to 
students in the California school system. We insist that my Palestinian and Lebanese daughter 
learns about Palestine and Lebanon in school, and not through a lens of Israeli racism and 
Western talking points about terrorism. 

We're hoping you have an open mind with regard to our struggles, especially in this time of 
rethinking traditional schooling structure with the pandemic. Please note that this decision will 
weigh heavily in the minds of my young family whenever we are asked to have our say about 
school funding in the future. We will not fund racist schools.
