Hi 
I've been reading about the ethnic studies issues coming up recently but can't find a proposed 
draft online that groups were critical of, like the proposal as anti semitic?  
I am a Cal State East Bay graduate with a BA in ethnic studies-- specializing in many areas but 
mainly Asian American studies and gender and sexuality in communities of color. 
Thanks
