Subject: [EXTERNAL] Ethnic Studies Curricula Now 

Esteemed Board Member:  

 I am writing to demand the implementation of Black experiences, voices, and history in K-12 curriculum. 
Subjecting students to a Eurocentric curriculum throughout their most formative years contributes 
significantly to the perpetuation of systemic racism within schools. This then contributes significantly to 
the degradation of Black people beyond the classroom. Please read the full letter of demands 
here: https://racialequityed.org/demands These demands are not new. They are an amplification of the 
calls to action of activists, students, and educators who have asked your school district to immediately 
implement racially inclusive, anti-racist Ethnic Studies. The time is long overdue to make change. White 
supremacy in public education must end now. There is no room for negotiation and placation. The time 
is now to tear down racism and demonstrate your commitment to ending systemic racism perpetuated 
by the use of Eurocentric curriculum.
